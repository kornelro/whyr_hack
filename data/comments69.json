As the post states, it was clear as far back as 2010 (and honestly earlier), that XUL extensions were both Firefox&#x27;s killer feature and also the reason that it got its ass kicked by Chrome (and to a lesser-extent, Safari). Extensions were amazing but the tax it created for performance, development, and security ended up becoming what made the browser so slow.

Every day that Mozilla didnít ship Electrolysis was one day that Chrome was simply better in terms of architecture, safety and security. Unfortunately, Mozilla delayed Electrolysis by years, in part because of the illusion that the Firefox benchmarks were better enough that it wouldnít matter for a long time, in part because we decided to test-drive Electrolysis with FirefoxOS before Firefox itself, but mostly because we did not want to lose all these add-ons.<p>&gt;In the end, Mozilla decided to introduce WebExtensions and finally make the jump towards e10s as part of the Quantum Project. We had lost years of development that we would never recover.<p>This aligns with what has always been my personal view which is that Mozilla waited too long to make the changes it needed to compete with Chrome and by the time it finally did the hard thing and lose extensions and start over.<p>When you consider that there was still time after Chrome was released but before Quantum where IE had the largest browser share (it wasnít a long period of time post-Chrome, but it existed), thatís indicates to me that there was time both before and after Chrome&#x27;s introduction for Mozilla to rip the band-aid off and drop XUL for the greater good of the browser.

The most compelling aspect of dial-up BBS MUDs was community locality: all of the players generally lived in your metro area.<p>In the 90s, the only popular BBS MUDs ran on the MajorBBS&#x2F;WorldGroup BBS software, which was technologically impressive for its time -- it could handle dozens of modems and concurrent users on a single PC running DOS, and supported pluggable games&#x2F;modules using an event-loop callback architecture. However, it was also incredibly expensive for the SysOp to purchase, as were its games. This meant that any given metro area typically only had a few MBBS&#x2F;WG BBSes, and they tended to be pay-for-access systems.<p>By far the most popular MBBS&#x2F;WG MUD was MajorMUD, although there were also some fairly successful predecessors (e.g. TeleArena, Mutants, Swords of Chaos) and successors (e.g. The Rose: Council of Guardians). These games were typically &quot;stock&quot; -- they had sprawling game worlds but were identical on each BBS, with little or no built-in ability for the SysOp to edit the world. Despite that, each game&#x27;s &quot;feel&quot; still naturally differed between each BBS just based on the local community.<p>As a teen MajorMUD addict, I always wanted to run my own board one day, but the cost was prohibitive. This eventually inspired me to write my own BBS MUD as an affordable doorgame for hobbyist&#x2F;lower-end systems, which at ~20K LOC was the first large program I ever wrote.

Around 1992 or so, our family bought our first computer (when I was around 5 years old) which was an Acorn A3000 running (if I recall correctly) RISC OS 2 on ROM. The school I went to also had Acorn computers (including the RISC PC toward the latter half of the 1990ís).<p>Nowadays I consider myself extraordinarily privileged to have experienced RISC OS on Acorn hardware in its heyday.\nI see so many things in modern computing inspired by RISC OS. The taskbar in modern era Windows and Mac OS is remarkably similar to RISC OS 2 which was released in 1988. RISC OS was also an early pioneer of anti-aliasing fonts and had it years before it appeared in Windows.<p>However, sadly, there are many things now lost to history. A machine running RISC OS 2 booted in literally &lt;3 seconds. It was basically just a console screen with ìRISC OS 2048Kî (or something along those lines) and a second or two later you were at the desktop. It is near impossible to find any modern computing device that boots as quick as the A3000 running RISC OS did.<p>RISC OS also had a wonderful file-save dialog which was simply the file iconówhich you were to simply drag and drop directly to the folder you wanted to save the file to! Given you usually had the right folder open anyway, it was usually a case of just dragging to your already open folder. So much more sensible than having to search for a folder in a small explorer window.<p>Thanks to all involved. Acorn and their RISC OS sparked a lifelong interest in computers.

It has been mankindís oldest and greatest tool for reshaping the natural world. ìTool,î however, is not quite the right word; unlike an inanimate knife, fire has a life of its own. It is, at best, a ìsemidomesticate,î appearing unbidden and, if not guarded carefully, escaping its shackles to become dangerously feral.<p>Hominidsí use of fire is historically deep and pervasive. Evidence for human fires is at least 400,000 years old, long before our species appeared on the scene. Thanks to hominids, much of the worldís flora and fauna consist of fire-adapted species (pyrophytes) that have been encouraged by burning. The effects of anthropogenic fire are so massive that they might be judged, in an evenhanded account of the human impact on the natural world, to overwhelm crop and livestock domestications. Why human fire as landscape architect doesnít register as it ought to in our historical accounts is perhaps that its effects were spread over hundreds of millennia and were accomplished by ìprecivilizedî peoples also known as ìsavages.î In our age of dynamite and bulldozers, it was a very slow-motion sort of environmental landscaping. But its aggregate effects were momentous.<p>Our ancestors could not have failed to notice how natural wildfires transformed the landscape: how they cleared old vegetation and encouraged a host of quick-colonizing grasses and shrubs, many bearing desired seeds, berries, fruits, and nuts. They could also not have failed to notice that a fire drove fleeing game from its path, exposed hidden burrows and nests of small game, and, most important, later stimulated the browse and mushrooms that attracted grazing prey. Native North Americans deployed fire to sculpt landscapes favored by elk, deer, beaver, hare, porcupine, ruffed grouse, turkey, and quail, all of which they hunted. The game they subsequently bagged represented a kind of harvesting of prey animals they had deliberately assembled by carefully creating a habitat they would find enticing. Quite apart from being the designers of hunting groundsóveritable game parksóearly humans used fire to hunt large game. The evidence suggests that long before the bow and arrow appeared, roughly twenty thousand years ago, hominids were using fire to drive herd animals off precipices and to drive elephants into bogs where, immobilized, they could more easily be killed.<p>Fire was the key to humankindís growing sway over the natural worldó a species monopoly and trump card, worldwide. The Amazonian rain forest bears indelible traces of the use of fire to clear land and open the canopy; Australiaís eucalyptus landscape is, to a considerable degree, the effect of human fire. The volume of such landscaping in North America was such that when it stopped abruptly, due to the devastating epidemics that came with the European, the newly unchecked growth of forest cover created the illusion among white settlers that North America was a virtually untouched, primeval forest. According to some climatologists, the cold spell known as the Little Ice Age, from roughly 1500 to 1850, may well have been due to the reduction of CO2óa greenhouse gasóbrought about by the die-off of North Americaís indigenous fire farmers.<\/i><p>Scott, James C..

This is different from out-of-line containers like std::vector, where the std::vector object itself consists only of a pointer and some lengths. In that case, the move constructor just copies the pointer and length values themselves and nulls them out in the original object, without copying the underlying data.

Libraries are tailored for web development and are probably well maintained because they are used by huge projects(wordpress, magento etc). For the same reason it won&#x27;t disappear any time soon because it handles most of the information on the web and also billions of dollars in online commerce.

Jet engines, like car engines, are not described by the &quot;Carnot cycle&quot;, and their efficiency is not governed by it. The Carnot cycle describes closed-system equipment like refrigerators and Nuke plants. Jet engines, like (our now obsolete) cars, start with new working fluid -- air -- at the intake, and discard it at the end -- exhaust. Their theoretical limit of efficiency is technically 100%, not the 30-40% typical of Carnot equipment. In practice, they don&#x27;t get close, but those huge ship engines do achieve up to 55%: they all take in air much, much cooler than their exhaust.<p>2. The change to the thrust vector is <i>not<\/i> a consequence of moving the engines forward. It is a simple result of the bigger engine diameter making the center farther below the wing. Moving the engines forward and up <i>reduced<\/i> the size of the change to the thrust vector -- just not enough so to match the old one. But the move had other effects, besides...<p>3. The added aerodynamic lift of the engine nacelles has <i>nothing<\/i> to do with more power being produced by the bigger engines. It is purely a product of the angle relative to the direction of air moving past. Bigger barrels have more area, and more lift, and moving them forward gave them more lever arm to apply their lift to rotate the plane instead of just holding it up, as wing lift does.<p>4. The change to the thrust vector is what makes punching the throttle <i>also<\/i> apply a force to rotate the airframe to a higher pitch angle. So there are two independent forces -- off-center lift, and off-center thrust -- both causing the same effect: pitching the plane up more than the pilot asked for. How much you get of each is a very complicated product of all the details of how the plane is flying.<p>5. On all 737s of any vintage, the controls really are still directly, physically connected, by steel cables, to the control surfaces -- the hinged bits at the back edges of wings and wing-shaped things. But there are hydraulics that also yank on the cables, and other stuff yanks on the control column, to doctor the pilot&#x27;s experience."],"time":["2020-08-21 20:33:03"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ppod"],"id":[24234147],"kids":[24234456],"parent":[24233339],"text":["Great article.

And the lift they produce is well ahead of the wingís center of lift, meaning the nacelles will cause the 737 Max at a high angle of attack to go to a higher angle of attack. This is aerodynamic malpractice of the worst kind.<p>&gt;Apparently the 737 Max pitched up a bit too much for comfort on power application as well as at already-high angles of attack. It violated that most ancient of aviation canons and probably violated the certification criteria of the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration.<p>Pure bullshit.  Many low wing passenger aircraft have this tendency somewhere in their flight envelope.  You can tone it down with some aerodynamic trickery but it&#x27;s just a fundamental trade-off you get when the engines are below and forward of the wing, the load is above the wing and you pin the throttle.  The reason we got ht MAX debacle was because the new 737 had this tendency to a degree and in a portion of the flight envelope different than the old 737 which meant it couldn&#x27;t ride on the old 737&#x27;s cert without a bandage over that.  The 737 MAX8 handles perfectly reasonably for an airborne bus.  What it does not do is handle perfectly reasonably for a 737-800 hence the reason they overlaid half baked software taking inputs from less than adequate hardware systems (well they were adequate for the less critical systems they were designed to feed into).<p>&gt;Letís review what the MCAS does: It pushes the nose of the plane down when the system thinks the plane might exceed its angle-of-attack limits; it does so to avoid an aerodynamic stall.<p>No.  It (when it&#x27;s no malfunctioning and trying to put you in a dive) pushes the nose down when you&#x27;re getting into the portions of the flight envelope where the MAX flies differently than the old 737 in order to fudge the same handling as the old 737 thereby skating by on the old cert.<p>Big disasters require many small things to go just right.  If the software was more robust this wouldn&#x27;t have happened.  If the hardware was more robust this wouldn&#x27;t have happened.  If the UX had been compatible with the pilots existing knowledge this wouldn&#x27;t have happened.  If the airlines were willing to pony up for type certs this wouldn&#x27;t have happened.

Plus it&#x27;s like YouTube Premium in that there are no ads.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if Amazon will actively promote these videos, so I suspect YouTube remains king for discovery.<p>Here are the videos:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;user&#x2F;CountryHouseGent\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;user&#x2F;CountryHouseGent<\/a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Travels-by-Narrowboat&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B07S6CK8MW\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Travels-by-Narrowboat&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B07S6CK8MW<\/a>"],"time":["2020-08-20 17:04:31"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["PopeDotNinja"],"id":[24222988],"kids":[24223095,24223399,24223218],"parent":[24222661],"text":["I like the idea of PeerTube, but every time I try to play a video, it buffers to the point of being unwatchable."],"time":["2020-08-20 15:29:06"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["zelly"],"id":[24224497],"kids":[24224552,24224527,24226158,24224583],"parent":[24222661],"text":["&gt; Itís 2020 and YouTube, as well as the rest of big tech, is continuing to remove content they donít agree with from their platforms.<p>Bold of these folks to assume their little self-hosted hard disk will outlive YouTube.

As many have already said, there are plenty of ways to host a video but none of them have good discoverability.
