Hiding a key to your house in a plant is a form of &quot;Security by Obscurity&quot;. Anyone that finds the key can open the door. Thats not very secure. So we hide the key so no only people that know where it is can find it. If an intruder found the key they&#x27;d immediately have access to the house. We rely on the obscurity of its location to provide whatever security it has to offer.<p>You could achieve the same affect by having a hidden door and leaving the key out in the open or hiding both. What use is the key if the location of the door it opens is &quot;obscure&quot;. This works because access is defined by knowing the location of the key and the door simultaneously.<p>Both are examples of &quot;Security by Obscurity&quot;"],"time":["2020-09-21 20:12:52"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["snowwolf"],"id":[24546567],"kids":[24546847],"parent":[24542104],"text":["Moving your SSH port isn&#x27;t really about security.

Despite the gut renovation, the company didn&#x27;t change much in practice because our core business model was the only thing that couldn&#x27;t change. We just became more effective.<p>I worked at Google from 2010-2015. When I looked for another job, I wanted to avoid the thing that bothered me about working at a FAANG. I didn&#x27;t have a clear understanding of how my contributions affected the bottom line. In fact, when I left, I asked a bunch of current employees the same question: &quot;Did Google make money on my employment?&quot; I got every answer you can imagine.<p>&quot;Of course they did, you helped grow an ecosystem with network effects, so the value you added was intangible but incalculably large.&quot;<p>&quot;Of course they didn&#x27;t. You grew the output of a product that people can use for free, so your work was mostly a loss leader.&quot;<p>Anyways, when I looked for a new job, I had a simple requirement. I wanted to work for a business model that I wanted to improve. Etsy fit the bill. A marketplace for small businesses to sell unique goods. I could feel good about improving this business model: improving our top line meant that more small businesses got sales. I can live with that.<p>Flash forward a year, and Etsy was in serious trouble. Growth was decelerating. Our core product was neglected in favor of newer offerings that had a long way to go to get traction. So we had some major gut renovation: new CEO. New CTO. New CFO. Two rounds of layoffs. A bunch of people left because the culture was gone. You think to yourself, &quot;OK, that&#x27;s it, the foxes are in the henhouse. What&#x27;s going to change?&quot; And it turns out that you can&#x27;t change that much! Our core business was to connect small businesses making special items to a global audience. So that&#x27;s what the foxes had to work with: A two-sided marketplace where they needed to please both the existing sellers (so that they didn&#x27;t just shut down their shop in favor of all of the other marketplaces they were using) and improve the site for our buyers. So they brushed the dust off of the core marketplace, assigned a bunch of people to focus on improving sales, and the results speak for themselves. Even ignoring Covid-related effects, our marketplace was healthier, growth was accelerating, and morale was up. And some of the people that left because it wasn&#x27;t the same anymore? They came back. We have a lot of &quot;boomerangs&quot; from that era.<p>I like point of incentives that OP brought up, you can also see that in some things that Etsy sellers hate. For example, the people who made Etsy set the fees way too low. It&#x27;s hard to walk that back. So you can see the executives try to find ways to bring the fees more in line with what Ebay or Amazon might get. The best they&#x27;ve come up with is improving an offering and restructuring the fees at the same time. &quot;New: off-site ads are new and improved, and if you get a sale, we charge %12&quot; type stuff. If you&#x27;re a seller that&#x27;s mad at Etsy, that&#x27;s the kind of thing that you&#x27;re going to complain about  - us following our own incentives."],"time":["2020-09-21 18:35:04"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["HugoDaniel"],"id":[24544457],"kids":[24544810],"parent":[24543510],"text":["This is a trick question, author seems to be vouching for blending the culture into the business model (&quot;...the better a product is, the better off the company is and its users are&quot;).<p>I do wonder how well can it fit the Betteridge Law of Headlines ?<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Betteridge%27s_Law_of_Headlines\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Betteridge%27s_Law_of_Headline...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-09-21 17:20:20"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["naringas"],"id":[24544415],"kids":[24545238,24551493,24544459],"parent":[24543510],"text":["this breaks <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Betteridge%27s_law_of_headlines\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Betteridge%27s_law_of_headline...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-09-21 17:17:04"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ponker"],"id":[24544840],"kids":{},"parent":[24543510],"text":["Perhaps this is why, to everyone’s astonishment, Google and Facebook have moved well ahead of Microsoft in the generally accepted “evil” rankings."],"time":["2020-09-21 17:54:58"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["hardwaresofton"],"id":[24540922],"kids":[24543430,24542182,24545436],"parent":[24538531],"text":["For those that want to see what it actually looks like:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ghc-proposals&#x2F;ghc-proposals&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;proposals&#x2F;0282-record-dot-syntax.rst#examples\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ghc-proposals&#x2F;ghc-proposals&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;p...<\/a><p><pre><code>    data Grade = A | B | C | D | E | F\n    data Quarter = Fall | Winter | Spring\n    data Status = Passed | Failed | Incomplete | Withdrawn\n\n    data Taken =\n      Taken { year :: Int\n            , term :: Quarter\n            }\n\n    data Class =\n      Class { hours :: Int\n            , units :: Int\n            , grade :: Grade\n            , result :: Status\n            , taken :: Taken\n            }\n\n    getResult :: Class -&gt; Status\n    getResult c = c.result -- get\n\n    setResult :: Class -&gt; Status -&gt; Class\n    setResult c r = c{result = r} -- update\n\n    setYearTaken :: Class -&gt; Int -&gt; Class\n    setYearTaken c y = c{taken.year = y} -- nested update\n\n    getResults :: [Class] -&gt; [Status]\n    getResults = map (.result) -- selector\n\n    getTerms :: [Class]  -&gt; [Quarter]\n    getTerms = map (.taken.term) -- nested selector<\/code><\/pre>"],"time":["2020-09-21 10:05:56"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["gregwebs"],"id":[24539291],"kids":[24539669,24539609],"parent":[24538531],"text":["Simon Peyton Jones: &quot;One possible reaction to a diversity of opinion is to do nothing and wait for clarity to emerge.

As they worked with clients, such as the Tennessee Valley Authority, the two realized the need for businesses to leverage COBOL systems while ramping up to do work on the Internet.<\/i><p>&gt; <i>COBOL, a language designed in 1959 at the Conference of Data Systems Languages, is why Y2K fever has gone on for the last several years. Because programmers condensed dates down to two digits, computers interpret the year 2000 as 1900.<\/i><p>&gt; <i>According to Dean, there are 700,000 COBOL programmers in the United States, and many businesses still have key databases running in the old language. Because of Y2K, these companies have had to invest vast amounts capital in their systems, which run on COBOL. As a result they designed COBOL Script, which has been in Beta-testing for eight months.<\/i><p>&gt; <i>The new type of COBOL allows programmers to tie these existing COBOL-dependent business applications onto the Internet.

I purposely left out many details for the sake of not wanting the post to be overly long.<p>I also find it pretty easy to re-trace my day and pick out details, like the orientation of how things were on a table at lunch, or what video game a kid was playing on the train who I happened to be sitting next to from 2 years ago without really trying to recall it.<p>But I&#x27;m 100% helpless when it comes to memorizing scripts.

The following thoughts may-or-may-not help others.<p>1. Train your chairperson.<p>The meeting chair is usually an important person. Everyone will be there to influence that person&#x27;s thoughts - as well as fight their own corner against professional and personal enemies. The secretary is usually someone a lot further down the pecking order. Which means training your chairperson is gonna be a fraught affair. However, if you can demonstrate to your chair that listening to your advice will lead to happier meetings then they may be happier to learn. I call this the &quot;Dark Art of upwards management&quot;.<p>The keys to a successful meeting - they vary. But a pretty fundamental key is &quot;what is this meeting about&quot;, alongside &quot;what does the chair want to get out of this meeting&quot;. Work these out (by any means possible), then ask the chair if your assumptions are right before the meeting starts. Most chairpeople will (in my experience) indulge your questions in a patronising sort of way the first few times, especially if you can follow up on likely arguments that may block successful outcomes. After a while intelligent chairs will be asking you for a summary of the meeting before it starts. Chairs do not like to have their time wasted. Be the person who helps the chair save their time.<p>2. Take notes during the meeting.<p>Never rely on memory recall after the meeting! Your memory will lie to you, especially about the boring bits which turn out to be really important for some of the participants. And use oldskool pen and paper: typing is essentially one dimensional, whereas a pad of paper has three dimensions and pens can draw arrows, bubbles, and (during the boring bits) relevant doodles as well as record word&#x2F;idea summaries. It should be enough to capture key phrases (which will trigger memories later) - if you need a full record of everything said during the meeting, use a voice recording device.<p>Also, advice for face-blind folks like me. Draw a map of where everybody is sitting at the very start of the meeting, and insist that everyone introduces themselves (for the record) before the bickering starts. Then you can give people numbers or pithy descriptions (&quot;bluedress&quot;, &quot;uglytache&quot;) to help capture who said what.<p>Nowadays online meetings can be recorded. Personally I think it makes the whole thing a lot less fun. Someone still has to summarise the meeting for the files, or action points, etc.<p>3. Write up a first draft of the meeting summary straight after the meeting.<p>Do not put this job off! Tackle it while the anger at being forced to do the work is still hot in your veins. It does not have to be perfect; it just needs to be in the required format. Fuller notes is best - it&#x27;s always easier to cut words later than to add them. Pull action points from the notes into a separate document. The action points are the only thing anyone&#x27;s interested in. But your chair will thank you later if you have a fuller record: being able to say during a subsequent meeting that something has already been decided - and being able to point to the record of that - will save your chairperson the pain of deja-vu ... and give them a reason to like you even more than they already did.<p>Final thoughts ... my ideal meeting lasts no more than ten minutes. If I need to meet someone (eg: client) on a regular basis I will do as much work beforehand as needed to make the meeting as speedy and pleasant for everyone attending. Know what every meeting is for; what I want to get out of the meeting. Know what others want to get out of the meeting before they know themselves. If you know someone will attend the meeting because they really like making everyone listen to their (never-ending!) voice ... lose their invite. If the matter of a meeting creeps way beyond its original scope, or you can see that you have nothing further to contribute, stand up and walk out."],"time":["2020-09-22 13:06:26"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["sAbakumoff"],"id":[24547843],"kids":[24548150],"parent":[24547098],"text":["I think that f2f meetings with real people are in the past and any self-respect online meetings software allows recordings.

Here are some other things I learned when doing something similar recently on my home network (except the router is a FreeBSD box).<p>- You can run `dhclient` interactively to learn the size of the prefix your ISP delegates. The OP touches on this, but the solution is OpenWRT-specific. Most distributions include `dhclient` or have it packaged.<p>- It’s possible that the IP your ISP assigns your router is in a different prefix from the prefix it delegates to you. For example, my ISP for a while assigned an IP in 2607::&#x2F;16 while delegating a &#x2F;56 prefix in 2605::&#x2F;16.<p>- Prefixes can also change. When I switched my router to FreeBSD, I started getting a &#x2F;56 prefix in 2607::&#x2F;16 instead of 2605::&#x2F;16.<p>- Some systems (e.g., Windows 7) don’t support getting DNS via router advertisements. If you want to support them, you need to run a DHCPv6 server and advertise that other stateful configuration is available.<p>- Kea is the successor to the ISC DHCP server. I found it a bit nicer and more flexible to configure.<p>- On Linux, NetworkManager and systemd-networkd handles a lot of this stuff automatically, but your customization options are limited. I couldn’t find a way to do the above without having to do things manually myself.<p>- FreeBSD’s DHCP client in base does not yet support DHCPv6. To get an IP and a prefix, you need to install one from ports. I’m using dhcp6c, following this guide[1] to set it up.<p>- ICMPv6 is integral to IPv6, but if you want to filter it, follow the advice in RFC-4890. Filtering ICMPv6 incorrectly will mess up your network in weird ways (e.g., my MBP could get an IP but wouldn’t get a DNS server until I fixed the problem).<p>- IANA maintains a registry[2] of IPv6 multicast addresses. I found this helpful when writing firewall rules.<p>- When advertising LAN services over DNS, make sure you use the “secure” or “template” IP and not the temporary IP used for IPv6 privacy. Also, you can’t assign domain names to link-local addresses, but you can advertise a DNS server (via RA and DHCPv6) on one.<p>- mDNS is the exception to the above. Avahi and Bonjour advertise link-local address and are able to resolve them properly.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vladvasiliu.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;20180827-0922-ipv6_prefix_delegation_freebsd&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vladvasiliu.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;20180827-0922-ipv6_prefix_deleg...<\/a><p>[2]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.iana.org&#x2F;assignments&#x2F;ipv6-multicast-addresses&#x2F;ipv6-multicast-addresses.xhtml\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.iana.org&#x2F;assignments&#x2F;ipv6-multicast-addresses&#x2F;ip...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-09-21 16:22:40"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ncmncm"],"id":[24550583],"kids":{},"parent":[24541652],"text":["Is there an easy way to discover whether your ISP would support v6?

You have some people who open grab and go, and hope only to franchise. You have some young chef who opens in a vacant&#x2F;former kitchen hoping to make his organic vegan dreams a reality. And a serial entrepreneur of hot spots. All other things being equal, they are competing on location, product quality, and marketing.<p>Near my home is Walmart, Target, Marshalls (second market clothes), Nordstrom Rack (second market for Nordstrom). You can shop at each and, when the fashion stars align, you can find the &quot;same item&quot; (IE. summer cotton beige unlined sport coat) at each location with nearly identical materials &amp; finish, yet each is set at increasingly higher prices (competing on marketing).<p>What&#x27;s the difference between &quot;Eames&quot; molded fiberglass wire base side chair ($400) and knockoff molded plastic ($80)? Quality of materials. Fit and finish. Quality control (competing on cost of goods, skilled labor, and capital asset&#x2F;investments)<p>The capital investments increase as you go from restaurant to clothing to furniture (and beyond, ie. auto manufacturing or space rockets).<p>If you look at the cost and investment at the high-end, it stands to reason it would take generations to move a company from creating &#x27;low quality&#x27; products to high quality, or you&#x27;re just happy right were you are (Making Crap since 1929). Or, you step in s#!t, make zillions processing online transactions in finance, then jump into electric auto-manufacturing. haha. It seems so interesting.

I recall reading somewhere about religious pilgrimage circuits in Europe (for hundreds of years) where pilgrims could &#x27;buy&#x27; &#x27;souvenirs&#x27;.<p>I wonder if you don&#x27;t necessarily need a wealthy economy. Rather, you need disposable income, and in modern times, low-cost plastics industry, international shipping, and cultures of collecting, plus cultural &#x27;stories&#x27; (sports teams, super heroes, music industry, arts, crafts) which give rise to creative expressions of the culture.<p>And why all this &#x27;crap&#x27;? Money money money. Jobs jobs jobs. (ie.

The (government&#x27;s) hope is that it will go into hiring&#x2F;spending and the real economy. Even if that is what happens to the majority of the new money supply (debatable) a large amount will go into financial assets for people who want to preserve their wealth.

The fundamentals of the economy are not good, but the new money has to go somewhere.

Narrative often drops off during a pure bubble. Rising prices fuel mania and further rising stock prices. This is a key element of bubbles: feedback. We have a debate about TSLA in 2019. You say it&#x27;s overpriced. I buy TSLA. I make money. We argue again. It&#x27;s hard for you to win the argument now.<p>Bubble narrative tends to get vague as time goes on. Bitcoin&#x27;s narrative was that it would be a real currency. People would get bitcoin salaries and buy groceries with it. That isn&#x27;t the narrative anymore.<p>The dotcom narrative, towards the end, became a vague &quot;<i>this is just how the economy works now<\/i>.&quot; The mania was there. The stock prices were there. The narrative itself fell off. Uber is another good example. What&#x27;s the narrative now?<p>Tesla has some differences. A &quot;narrative&quot; <i>is<\/i> actually driving stock prices. Tesla investors are betting on certain things being achieved. They may or may not be achieved, and that will determine whether or not it was a good investment.<p>Narrative 1 is (at current prices), break-even or less for investors: Tesla will keep its position in the EV market, but the EV market will grow massively.<p>Narrative 2 is: Self driving is coming soon. Tesla is in position and others are not.<p>The first half of the narrative is suspect. &quot;Soon&quot; can be a long time. The second half is (IMO), pretty solid. It takes time to make new models of cars. This is the other extreme to software. If all factories switched in one day, it still takes a decade to replace the full fleet. Meanwhile, factories long lead times. Etc.<p>If the software works and they get a regulatory green light, Tesla immediately controls an existing fleet and all their new cars are immediately self driving. It&#x27;s a very big lead in a very, very saucy new market.<p>Now... You can think that&#x27;s likely or unlikely.

Other people will say that getting there earlier can save a life, but most of the time it has no bearing whatsoever.&#x27;&quot;<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vox.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;10&#x2F;30&#x2F;7079547&#x2F;fire-firefighter-decline-medical\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vox.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;10&#x2F;30&#x2F;7079547&#x2F;fire-firefighter-decl...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-09-02 07:35:42"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["_jn"],"id":[24350271],"kids":[24350488],"parent":[24350022],"text":["Hate when people earn enough to live in the city they work in."],"time":["2020-09-02 07:34:58"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["hackeraccount"],"id":[24355735],"kids":{},"parent":[24350022],"text":["Public sector unions are toxic."],"time":["2020-09-02 19:45:29"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[24350427],"kids":{},"parent":[24350022],"text":{},"time":["2020-09-02 08:02:01"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":["koprulusector"],"id":[24351261],"kids":[24351365],"parent":[24348233],"text":["I&#x27;ve worked on something similar using libvirt, kvm, and qemu.

No more despair when the batteries it needs are not the type you have lying around. No more auto-off in the middle of weighing (cannot believe how many scales are plagued by that - or did I just get unlucky?). Just spin the wheel a couple of times and it goes on for minutes.
