It&#x27;s just the difference between two offset moving averages. The length of the average (peak time) serves as an integration that removes high frequency noise. The offset (gap time) provides differentiation of the integrated signal, which removes low frequency changes in baseline. Timing precision is improved by using the trap filter output rather than the raw signal compared to a threshold, as it effectively acts like a constant fraction discriminator. It also makes it easier to deal with pile-up events where multiple waveforms lie on top of each other, though that&#x27;s improbable unless you measure a source that&#x27;s really hot or pulsed."],"time":["2020-09-02 13:48:04"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["epa"],"id":[24347515],"kids":[24350793],"parent":[24344382],"text":["Awesome to see an original EEE Pc still being used in 2020!"],"time":["2020-09-01 23:48:54"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["pjmlp"],"id":[24350802],"kids":{},"parent":[24344382],"text":["I missed the ATLAS&#x2F;TDAQ HLT&#x2F;Alice references, though. :)"],"time":["2020-09-02 09:12:08"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["sandworm101"],"id":[24345474],"kids":{},"parent":[24344382],"text":["A very interesting home experiment.

Due to chronic illness I am actually on disability and have limitations in both working hours and salary due to this. For my early career I was advised by well meaning but non disabled people to lie and hide this and it created a vicious cycle of health issues and severe burn out. I will no longer work for any company without being upfront about this, which is a plus because it helps me find places where I thrive better, but also despite everything tech still is not great for part time or limited hours jobs. At this point also I have to be upfront because my resume became patchy due to taking time off for my health.<p>I started out in my career doing test automation stuff but then moved into backend rails stuff pretty quickly. I can pick stuff up pretty quickly if there is a patient team that supports pairing and peer support. I wouldn&#x27;t do well in a non progressive workplace or a workplace where diverse hires are tokenized.<p>I feel like there could be a good fit out there in Seattle somewhere and this could be a mutually beneficial agreement...if your company has a bunch of little side projects I could tinker with, not mission critical stuff, and would be OK with super flexible part time hours. The hours&#x2F;salary thing is important to discuss since I need certain hours for my health and need to keep an eye on salary so I can keep my health insurance.<p>I would love an environment where I could learn alongside smart people with things I never got into as much such as IOT hardware, AI, natural language, and rounding out my server&#x2F;backend stack&#x2F;devops knowledge.<p>I have mostly lived and worked as a backend dev in Seattle but I spent a year or so in Berlin doing the same. let me know if this sounds like a good fit!"],"time":["2020-09-11 08:40:07"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["unforswearing"],"id":[24457574],"kids":{},"parent":[24342496],"text":["Location: Washington DC Metro (Maryland)<p>Remote: Yes<p>Willing to relocate: No<p>Technologies &#x2F; Skills:  Project Management (PMP), Technical Writing, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Google Apps Script &#x2F; GSuite Developer Platform, AWS EC2 &#x2F; S3, Firebase, NodeJS, Linux server administration.

Lots of wins. Especially interested in privacy-preserving tech. My background is in digital marketing. I&#x27;m good at initiation, delivery, and I&#x27;m adaptable.<p>Let&#x27;s talk about winning.<p>- Network Operator Course. From the decision to deliver, it took five weeks to deliver a course. We got 2.6K sign-ups and a 40% completion rate.<p>- Third-Party App Program. I conceptualized and delivered a third-party app program which is now the largest channel in terms of clicks for that project (around 3K to 4K a month). In contrast, the impact of the annual virtual summit got about 10K. So it&#x27;s x4 for $0 budget.<p>- Viral Campaign. I ran an infographic contest that generated some great visuals and grew an email list by 20% (from 10K to 12K).<p>- Guides.

My meta approach explores value chains and brokers relationships. Top-down models and hierarchy can be virtuous. However, they also limit decision making and the number of actions that can be taken. If you apply the same top-down models in your organization across a community, it will inherit these limitations. You will limit content and engagement.<p>What does a good community look like?

Just give people transparency and get rid of all the big bad guys and the enlightened citizens of the cyberspace will find their way out of it, nothing new about that.<p>I don&#x27;t think this is realistic.

In my mind that invalidates the necessary consent required when the activity involves sex work of some kind, making it unethical from the buyer to acquire such a service despite it being legal locally. While trafficking is of course still illegal, I am unclear about the laws protecting trafficking victims from their &quot;buyers&quot; in non-consenting transactions.<p>Since it is practically impossible to confirm if a given sex worker is participating under duress or not, especially when it occurs &quot;remotely&quot; as in this OnlyFans situation, I would say it is always unethical to purchase such services.<p>In addition, what I would consider &quot;under duress&quot; is fairly broad, not only under threat of violence from traffickers, but also including economic duress where an individual feels that it is the only way to earn an income to put food on the table. In this vein, I would consider sex tourism to poorer countries a form of exploitation and thus unethical, even though one could argue the individuals from the poorer countries selling such services do so &quot;willingly&quot;.<p>This article writes that one of these women feels that she must engage in sex work through OnlyFans because it is &quot;the only way she can support her family...&quot;. It leaves a bad taste as I would not consider that she is participating in the transaction without duress, and thus actually consenting in the transaction. Would you be okay with it if you knew that the woman you were buying lingerie pictures &quot;had&quot; to do it? How would that not be a form of exploitation?<p>However, one can extend this argument to any type of work. &quot;She says her _____ work is the only way she can support her family...&quot;, replace with an arbitrary line of work and activity (woodcutting&#x2F;marketing&#x2F;basketweaving). Is there any thing that makes sex work special (apart from some puritanical opinion which are not actually applicable), that would make such a transaction inherently more unethical than say being forced to work at McDonalds because it&#x27;s the only way to make ends meet?

Centering on schemas and typescript is as well. The broadcast channel based leader election also solved the common issue with Pouch where you can’t respond to real-time changes and update your UI if a separate tab was watching too.<p>It’s wise of them to also support pulling data from GraphQL. I built the first version of NoteBrook on top of couch&#x2F;pouch, and the biggest pain points were:<p>1. Pouchdb was before async&#x2F;await and typescript. The typings can be inconsistent, and it’s very difficult to properly manage the lifetimes of local databases because of the promise chaining.<p>2. A database technology for Real time replication Needs ACLs on a per-document basis. I built provisioning scripts to manage separate databases per user, as suggested, and it’s very cumbersome. It prevents me from lots of data sharing models like promoting one record to public view, or sharing a record with another user in a different tenant.<p>3. Personally I feel that the naming &#x2F; marketing of the product is poor. It does not feel professional ( couch, futon, fauxton, pouch, couchbase) do not feel like professional grade products I can depend on to run a business.<p>I think it would be good for RxDB to support its own backend technology and move away from PouchDB, and in the meantime, de-emphasize the relationship with PouchDB. The RxDB product doesn’t require you to use PouchDB and at this point it’s got a lot of buzz around it and doesn’t need that tie to PouchDB to continue.<p>I feel an ideal library would offer a real-time and offline client db, user auth, and billing, tied to a backend database of my choosing (eg. Postgres, MariaDB). The data layer should allow me to specify the durability requirements of each write (down to the specific entity type) and enforce an atomic commit on all related records in one transaction at the level of the most strict entity in the commit. It should be trivial to shard because the syncing protocol the clients use itself should be available to the server. Multitenancy should be built in. It should support real-time ephemeral in memory data for collaboration&#x2F;chat scenarios, with optional durability that’s eventually consistent.

Yeah I know (StackOverflow) and it doesn&#x27;t even relate directly to your problem ....But if you read the long bit below it might give you a bit of blue-sky thinking.<p>&gt;&gt;\nThe next is determining what behavior constitutes a possible bot. For your stackoverflow example, it would be perhaps a _certain number of page loads in a given small time frame from a single user (not just IP based, but perhaps user agent, source port, etc.)_<p>Next, you build the engine that contains these rules, collects tracking data, monitors each request to analyze against the criteria, and flags clients as bots. I would think you would want this engine to run against the web logs and not against live requests for performance reasons, but you could load test this.<p>I would imagine the system would work like this (using your stackoverflow example): The engine reads a log entry of a web hit, then adds it to its database of webhits, aggregating that hit with all other hits by that unique user on that unique page, and record the timestamp, so that two timestamps get recorded, that of the first hit in the series, and that of the most recent, and the total hit count in the series is incremented.<p>Then query that list by subtracting the time of the first hit from the time of the last for all series that have a hit count over your threshold. Unique users which fail the check are flagged. Then on the front-end you simply check all hits against that list of flagged users, and act accordingly. Granted, my algorithm is flawed as I just thought it up on the spot.<p>If you google around, you will find that there is lots of free code in different languages that has this functionality. The trick is thinking up the right rules to flag bot behavior. \n&lt;&lt;<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;6979285&#x2F;protecting-from-registration-bots\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;6979285&#x2F;protecting-from-...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-09-01 22:06:14"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["issa"],"id":[24338222],"kids":[24338363],"parent":[24334657],"text":["I&#x27;ve had a lot of luck with variants of a honeypot.

Death certificates of beekeepers were examined for causes of mortality, and proportionate mortality ratios were compared with those for the general U.S. population. Beekeepers had a slightly lower than expected fraction of deaths from cancer. The deficit of lung cancers in male beekeepers was significant (p less than 0.05) and may indicate that fewer beekeepers were cigarette smokers. The frequencies of other cancers did not differ significantly from expectation. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma developed in four persons, and was expected in two. Mortality from diseases other than cancer showed no unusual patterns. At least two persons died from accidents directly related to the care of beehives. Analysis of a subgroup of 377 males with major roles in the beekeeping industry showed no substantial differences in distribution of causes of death.
