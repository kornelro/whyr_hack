I recently purchased an e-Book on Wiley too. Atleast, the author got an EPUB with DRM in it, which is pretty easy to remove using de-DRM tools (open source). However, what I got from my purchase from Wiley was some stupid proprietary format that requires me to install some crapware called Vitalsource. There is nothing out there that will de-DRM for you and you are forced to install this crapware wherever you intend to read this - be it on your mobile or desktop. I thought ok, no biggie, let me seek a refund ASAP, but Wiley explicitly disallows refunds, probably this is the reason.<p>In their entire website, they refer to these things as &quot;E-Books&quot;, but it is anything but. It&#x27;s a proprietary viewer. There is a small &quot;i&quot; icon next to them in the listings, which I presume they must have added recently that now states these things aren&#x27;t actually E-Books (in fine print). Clever huh?<p>Either way, I don&#x27;t understand the point of DRM. People can still make copies if they&#x27;re determined to, and studies have shown that giving away ebooks actually increases sales. If these sort of publishers go bankrupt, no one will shed a tear.

This led into callback hell[1], which was specially bad back then on the backend.<p>Luckily after a migration that has taken many years, now most of the libraries use async&#x2F;await instead of callbacks.

Note that I mostly work on the backend, so my frontend knowledge is at least 5 years out of date. My terms might be wrong, but I think the concepts align closely with how I projected the web would work back in 1995 when I first saw it. Pretty much everything has gone the opposite direction though, and we’ve recreated all of the pitfalls of desktop programming on the web.<p>- A one-shot, partially Turing complete scripting language would be nice. We should be able to include external scripts, position elements, perform basic computation, and then have a guarantee that the script has finished and will no longer run and use resources. Javascript is fine, but the user would have to give permission for it to run setTimeout(), setInterval() and similar ongoing operations. Discussion needed about scripts running post-load, like for clicks are keeping elements positioned (possibly a user-settable instruction, memory or time limit).<p>- I&#x27;d vote to largely retire frontend model-view-control (MVC) patterns. The browser is already the view, so I find most of the approaches introduced by frameworks like Angular.js to be at the very least superfluous, but potentially misguided or even hazardous. See Intercooler.js for declarative alternatives to what we have now.<p>- Instead of hand-rolled scripted pages, browsers need a basic component or window metaphor, in which all GUI elements descend from a base element, can be nested, and have a full life cycle that can be customized at each step. The user would have to give permission to override builtin elements like &lt;body&gt;, &lt;input&gt;, etc, but elements could descend from them with overrides. Discussion is needed about security. For what it&#x27;s worth, I just don&#x27;t think that the various approaches to building components have panned out. I feel like there is a common abstraction here behind things like React that could be generalized.<p>- On that note, the way we include remote resources on the web is broken. We need a way to choose whether the HTML for a component is written in-place, or as a URL (or other address) that includes the remote definition. Similar to if inline data: base64 images correspond to our current markup, then we could replace a block of text with an href to allow reuse. Like &lt;div href=“example.com&#x2F;mydiv.html”&gt;, and mydiv.html would hold &lt;div&gt;something&lt;span&gt;something&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;div&gt; or whatever. See server side includes (SSI) for an early failed example of this.<p>- Individual requests need to go away and be replaced by a content-addressable caching system where the hash is the address, so we can go back to including individual global sources of truth for things like jQuery or Bootstrap files, rather than maintaining copies of those includes on our own server. See subresource integrity (SRI) as a starting point.<p>- It may be time to scrap build systems. I&#x27;d like to see the world take a step back, and consider architecting a web where more protocols and formats like UDP or Markdown &quot;just work&quot; and don&#x27;t need to be transpiled to whatever brittle&#x2F;proprietary-infested conventions are available. Think of this as how compilers can provide generators by altering the code to work in runtimes that don’t have generators. That concept could be extended to everything, so that the server&#x2F;browser is able to provide features that aren’t yet mainstream, by perhaps running portions of our build pipelines directly under the hood. Basically a turing complete language should be able to run anything, but right now we have wide swaths of computer science blocked to us for security and other reasons, but usually because a proprietary player like Microsoft doesn’t want to implement something. We should be able to run Firefox within Edge, conceptually. And figure out what fundamental capabilities must be provided to allow for something so general. It could be as basic as a general-purpose sandbox where the user decides which system calls and data to allow the executables running inside to access.<p>- Let&#x27;s talk about how to remove undefined and optional rules from the major RFCs and specifications. As an analogy, much of the optional functionality in OpenGL caused the renderer to fall off the fast path back to the software renderer. But since performance is a feature in OpenGL, dancing around optionals caused an explosion in implementation complexity. Today many thousands of developers reinvent the wheel countless times because someone decided way back when to limit video card programming to SIMD (thus barring conceptually simple techniques like ray tracing). A better way would be to have general-purpose computing so we could go back to some kind of cluster programming in languages like Erlang and Go, but I digress. A similar thing needs to happen with the web, where the underlying implementation would be general-purpose and open source (to virtually guarantee that all options are implemented) then we could pick and choose which ones to disable due to security concerns or whatnot.<p>- The semantic web is unlikely to ever happen, but, resource description framework (RDF) triples and concepts like hyperlinks pointing back to the caller could&#x2F;should happen first. This needs to be done by the server or browser in an automated way 100% if possible. Content-addressable links might partially fix this. Basically the gap between raw HTML and the metadata that search engines and advertisers store needs to be formalized. Think of this as taking HEAD requests, REST API descriptions in things like Swagger, and any other information gleaned by spiders or AIs, and making that readily accessible for any page. So when we go on something like eBay, we could look at the page outline and detect any tabular date, contact information, form actions, etc etc and be able to manipulate that page metadata the way we currently examine things like an element&#x27;s styling.<p>- A prerequisite to the above is to be able to download portions of websites or the entire web as a directed graph, and to do that, we need to be able to query the web in something like SQL, only without a search engine. So to use the eBay example, if I had this then I could find my dream car by searching and cross referencing against things like performance, fuel economy, warranty, and so on. The way we might manipulate such data in Excel or a SQL database. Another way to say this is that most sites would lose their search field, and the browser would see the site as a gist or index describing the graph, with common actions suggested, provided by the community of previous searchers. See Neo4j for how something like this might look in practice.<p>- It’s time to talk about retiring the app as a separate concept from a website. No single metric like performance, device accessibility or ease of use exists as a hard limitation, or justifies developers having to maintain 2+ sets of code and get mired in cross-platform development. A path forward here is to provide funding for game developers and other performance-oriented developers to revamp browser rendering engines to run at many thousands of frames per second instead of the glacial pace they crawl now. For example, the DOM diffing of React should have already existed as a feature of early HTML renderers. We need to be looking at things like forking and copy-on-write to enhance the performance of web pages that share the vast majority of their content. There are also streaming techniques that would let browsers access media as memory-mapped data rather than loading files into memory. Browsers could be as powerful as they are now, but run in something like 16 MB of ram rather than GBs, and always react instantly rather than having multi-second delays when many tabs are open.<p>Well that’s 10. I know there are many, many more things I would like to see but maybe this isn’t the best forum for this. I’m temporarily retired from programming after going through the worst burnout of my life last year. All I see around me are these disjunctions between what the world is and what it could be, so it feels like in order to work anymore, I would have to go back to basics and rewrite most stuff from the ground up. That’s with all of tech, not any one area. So I just concentrate on the things I can control, like making rent, getting my car fixed, staying in touch with relatives, etc. Tech is just too much of a time suck for me to justify anymore, when all of the capital has been vacuumed up by a handful of large players that don’t care about this stuff, to the point where winning the internet lottery with a startup is about as likely as being in the NBA."],"time":["2020-05-26 21:15:29"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Nextgrid"],"id":[23313075],"kids":[23313282],"parent":[23310792],"text":["You want to fix the Internet?<p>Easy.

It may be an indictment of the JavaScript ecosystem and the current state of the web that nothing exists that can help the user accomplish this out of the box, but that doesn&#x27;t diminish the validity of the author&#x27;s requirements. (It&#x27;s also possible that next.js, Gatsby, or another framework can actually support these with relatively little configuration.) But we should applaud the user for wanting to create a totally statically generated site! (I noted that Gatsby&#x27;s homepage was not static generated and clearly takes a second before displaying content.)<p>Given that the author wants to render to static HTML, I interpret React + TypeScript to primarily mean JSX + TypeScript. Is this really any different than saying Liquid + Ruby, or Go templates + Go (used by Jekyll and Hugo respectively)? JSX and React&#x27;s component based system were literally designed for HTML, and I&#x27;d argue it is definitively a better solution than the raw template libraries offered by other languages. You get automatic &quot;syntax&quot;-checking of the HTML by using JSX. By using JavaScript you have proper control flow instead of the awkward in-line conditionals and loops in templating libraries. A Component-based system makes code-reuse significantly easier. And by using TypeScript you can get type-checking for all of this. Unfortunately, using JSX and TypeScript means that you need some sort of build pipeline, and that&#x27;s where the current state of JavaScript really rears its ugly head and adds a lot of complexity.<p>Writing posts in Markdown is also totally reasonable, as is wanting to support small amounts of interactability in future posts. A couple of comments mention that you could just add raw HTML to a Markdown file and call React from there, but that doesn&#x27;t solve the compilation problem. A lot of comments also missed the desire for interactivity. It&#x27;s for a developer blog!

To observe this state, you can have a function that reads and exports bytesReceived, on demand and when&#x2F;if needed. This provides for the best flexibility and maintainability of the system, since you will be able to change your observability stack at a later time, or have more than one of them, without changing the stats-keeping statements at the point where they appear in the application code. This also provides the best scalability and performance since you are able to aggregate separate counters from multiple threads, if needed, minimize or optimize locking, etc.<p>The problem is there are a lot of off-the-shelf observability frameworks for Go that require the pattern in the article: you emit a value to a hook function at the point of production.

From then on, not more than a single policy change could be made per month, and all of it should still fit on the same single page.

Player 1 should only bluff at the optimal rate if player 2 punishes them for deviating from this rate by changing the frequency that they call when holding the king. Otherwise, Player 1 gains more on average by bluffing with the queen more frequently. So, how should Player 2 figure out if Player 1 is actually bluffing at the optimal rate (and not higher)? It could happen, with exponentially small probability, that Player 1 decides whether to bluff randomly, and bluffs with the first 10,000 queens before ever folding with a queen. How does Player 2 distinguish this from Player 1 only ever bluffing with the queen?<p>But perhaps this is something that the Nash Theorem deals with? I don&#x27;t know.

All major payment systems currently (PayPal, Venmo, FB Messenger, etc) are still based on government currencies. Libra is different as it is a cryptocurrency, so no government can easily control it. This might seem fine since everyone likes Bitcoin and such, but those cryptocurrencies are controlled by the community, not by a central organization. Libra is controlled by a group of major corporations and organizations, not by the community. Meaning that if those corporations decide to do something with the currency, no person or government could stop them.<p>That might not sound too bad. They own platform, so they should be able to control it, right? However, you need to consider that if someone controls the economy of a country, they control the government of that country as well. They would be able to control inflation and therefore the boom&#x2F;bust cycle. If Libra is used by the majority of citizens and businesses in a country, then the group of corporations ruling Libra will be able to manipulate that country&#x27;s government to do their bidding. I imagine countries with unstable governments will be the first heavy adopters of Libra and those governments are the easiest to manipulate. Libra could spawn the age of global corporatism.<p>Libra may turn out fine and improve the world, but that is only if its administration remains uncorrupted. Take a look through the list of entities that have joint control of Libra. I doubt you would trust most of them to control the world economy.<p>But this is the exact reason that Libra is controlled by a diverse group of organizations, right?

My home ISP has first moved off static delegations in favor of dynamic ones via DHCPv6, and then broke IPv6 routing completely [1] and after a few weeks of me complaining still seemingly has no interest in fixing it. The place I work for now has no IPv6 connectivity and has no plans for it in the future. Many people I talk with don&#x27;t believe that IPv6 is the future and I commonly hear that they have forcibly disabled it on their computers due to this or that random problem.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tablix.org&#x2F;~avian&#x2F;blog&#x2F;archives&#x2F;2020&#x2F;05&#x2F;on_missing_ipv6_router_advertisements&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tablix.org&#x2F;~avian&#x2F;blog&#x2F;archives&#x2F;2020&#x2F;05&#x2F;on_missi...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-26 12:47:00"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["corty"],"id":[23309397],"kids":[23309665,23309777,23309646,23309653],"parent":[23308478],"text":["DHCPv6 is broken.

With SLAAC, you can invent your own, any amount you want, it just has to be within the same subnet; the &#x2F;64, smallest subnet, is pretty huge.<p>2) For tethering with IPv6, you need multiple IP addresses. You cannot do NAT as you do with IPv4.<p>Therefore, with IPv6, telcos could disable the tethering function of the phones &#x2F; charge extras, just by suitably configuring their network.

The stats on cancer or heart related treatment seems to be backed up though, so I can&#x27;t comment on that.<p>The real issue with all of this is that the Trump administration is incompetent and American government in general is reactionary and only promotes policies that are selfish. Its been known for years that people have no safety net, just put on NPR and like once a week this comes up, and it&#x27;s always been known that small businesses really aren&#x27;t racking in the cash to stay afloat for a long time without money. The government just needs to step up and support people, with health care for all, with long term financial assistance, and they need to increase taxes to do this. They are sort of doing it now with checks, but that&#x27;s going to go away once the pandemic is over and everybody who is not in tech or generally upper middle class will go back to being on edge because one disaster will eff to their lives.<p>You also can&#x27;t blame this on epidimiologists. They provide their assessment and policy makers have to weigh those options with all the other ones and come up with a strategy. That&#x27;d be like be like blaming the person who came up with the hail marry when it is a coach&#x27;s decision to use it every play."],"time":["2020-05-26 18:18:54"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jdkee"],"id":[23313249],"kids":{},"parent":[23311170],"text":["As Taleb recently put it, better to over-react and have to ease off than to under-react and have to play catch-up.

But this one really doesn&#x27;t qualify. It falls squarely in the category of reasonable opinions. Let&#x27;s look at the claim: &quot;There is NO WAY (ZERO!) that Mail-In Ballots will be anything less than substantially fraudulent&quot;. Clearly the veracity of the statement rests on the word &quot;substantially.&quot; It&#x27;s inconceivable that no one ever takes, for example, an elderly relative&#x27;s mail in ballot and votes it fraudulently. So for this to be a reasonable opinion, it merely has to be reasonably possible for the claim to be true.<p>So, let&#x27;s consider if such fraud could possibly be substantial. Let&#x27;s use California as an example. Registering to vote is easy, all you need is a web browser[1] and a mailing address where you reside or with a resident willing to give you ballots or ignorant that they are receiving them[2]. Also, the State of California faces an impractically large legal hurdle to reject suspected fraudulent ballots[3] so it can be assumed that most if not all will be accepted. It seems clear based on the observable facts that substantial fraud is certainly possible under the California regime. Please note I am not claiming such fraud actually happens, merely that it is easily practicable for an organization as well organized as, say, a political party. To be honest, I bet literally hundreds if not thousands of readers on this site could build &quot;California vote fraud as as service&quot; as a side gig.

I like the little inclusion before tweets, but there&#x27;s no sources on them. Then when you scroll down on the tweets I see them in this order: The Hill, WaPo, CNN, a CBS News reporter, a Fortune Magazine reporter, a Vox reporter, Sr Political Reporter for Huffington, ACLU Nebraska, a CNN political correspondent.<p>The issue here is that everything here is considered in the hard left of the media. I&#x27;m concerned that this will only help grow the divide between Americans, though I also don&#x27;t have a better alternative to this. Clearly there is a lack of coverage of this from the right and in fact the opposite. A quick DDG search of &quot;fox news mail in ballot&quot; pulls up [0][1][2]. So when you see things like this I think it is easier to say that &quot;the left&quot; is trying to trick you. If Fox is your primary source of news, then it does look like Twitter is trying to silence a real issue. If Fox isn&#x27;t your primary source of news then it looks like Twitter is trying to fight misinformation. Things are so crazy that it really is hard to find the truth and there is very good reason to believe that someone is lying. And no one wants to admit that someone they&#x27;ve trusted for a long time is lying to them, especially when there&#x27;s nuggets of truth that you can hold onto.<p>So I&#x27;m a little worried about the repercussions of this, especially since the right already thinks Twitter is supporting the left.<p>Edit: By hard left I mean from the perspective of Fox viewers. My main point is about the perspective of the people this is specifically aimed at. While on the left we don&#x27;t see it that way go talk to your friends on the right, they see it differently. My concern is because we need to unify and not divide.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.foxnews.com&#x2F;politics&#x2F;voter-fraud-california-man-finds-dozens-of-ballots-stacked-outside-home\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.foxnews.com&#x2F;politics&#x2F;voter-fraud-california-man-...<\/a><p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.foxnews.com&#x2F;politics&#x2F;south-carolina-election-ballots-reportedly-found-in-maryland-this-week\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.foxnews.com&#x2F;politics&#x2F;south-carolina-election-bal...<\/a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;video.foxnews.com&#x2F;v&#x2F;6158607323001#sp=show-clips\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;video.foxnews.com&#x2F;v&#x2F;6158607323001#sp=show-clips<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-27 01:42:29"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Balgair"],"id":[23318111],"kids":{},"parent":[23317286],"text":["It&#x27;s a strange decision by Twitter here, but they are in a strange position.<p>Donny, love him or hate him, does say a fair few things that are ... questionable.

The fact that it required to sign in for Windows Preview program. (I think this is not required anymore) but it was very annoying as it requires very long updates that require like a million reboots.

Here&#x27;s a novel thought: instead of providing yet another iteration of workarounds for the power user, how about just fixing it for every user.<p>Take for instance the Start Menu. When the Win-X &quot;quick access&quot; menu was added years ago, it was essentially an admission that the Start Menu is not the best way to start at least some things. It didn&#x27;t really get much better since but the Search and Run functionality was integrated into it.

It is, however, tricky for various fields of study. While for computer science it&#x27;s definitely easy to offer an online curriculum, I would say the value for a lot of the physical sciences comes from the hands on experience. This is the case for business students as well, where most of the value of in person classes is derived from the network that one builds. It&#x27;s much harder to build those kinds of relationships without engaging with other students face to face.<p>That being said, in my experience regarding the computer science perspective, having mandatory in person lectures added little to no value in terms of actual knowledge gained. In fact, I would argue that not being able to participate online was a detriment to my personal college experience. In order to avoid taking on massive amounts of debt, I had to work full-time while doing my undergrad. I was lucky enough to land a full time development gig my sophomore year, but it required being in the office 80% of the week. Between work, commuting, and sitting in a lecture hall, I had very few hours left in the day to actually work on my assignments and this caused me to make sacrifices in order to manage my time.<p>There was nothing communicated in our lectures that could not have been communicated in a pre-recorded video or via a class forum. The option to participate online will open up doors for many individuals who might not have been able to pursue higher education before, such as those who have to work or take care of their families.<p>The article mentions the OMSCS program at Georgia Tech [1], and I can&#x27;t recommend this program enough. I&#x27;m currently about half way through the curriculum, and the format of the program alone addresses almost every issue I&#x27;ve had with my undergrad. I am able to watch lectures and do projects at my own pace which makes managing my time significantly easier. It also comes at 10% of the cost of my undergrad and that&#x27;s a price that&#x27;s hard to beat.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;omscs.gatech.edu&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;omscs.gatech.edu&#x2F;<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-26 07:25:21"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mto"],"id":[23308358],"kids":{},"parent":[23307202],"text":["Teaching second semester CS students atm I unfortunately see that many students just can&#x27;t handle it remotely.\nAlthough I admit that I&#x27;m skeptical if students unable to do some work independently are... a good fit.<p>I live in a European country where things are different of course.

They concluded <i>Web-based distance education is not appropriate for every student.<\/i> [0] (There also exists a long form narrative about the origins of this, but I can&#x27;t seem to find it again)<p>The opinion columnist misses crucially what college is. It&#x27;s not really about lectures. Rather, it&#x27;s an incubator for young people to intellectually grow. Online courses don&#x27;t give you the ability to drop in on a hundred different clubs, go to the library, party, date, drop in the office of some very smart people.<p>A college campus drops some thousands of young people in the same proximity, and gives them a collective experience. It situates them amongst a litany of highly intellectual adults and gives them a way to try news things. I just graduated from university, and I was leaving the core curriculum had become under conflict. I attended a Jesuit university, so there was a large philosophical&#x2F;religious portion of curriculum. Opponents say this leads to no meaning job skills, and it&#x27;s hard to disagree.<p>College isn&#x27;t just about getting a job, at least it shouldn&#x27;t be. We have culturally deemed the degree necessary for employment, and that&#x27;s the bigger issue. I grew philosophically and theoretically in the classroom, but it was everything outside of the classroom that made me readily employable. Frankly, it was a privilege that I had four years to figure out who I was and what I enjoyed.<p>I recognize that not everyone is this fortunate. Some go to college just because they need to find jobs. That is where I think online learning has potential. We must acknowledge it will lead to a bifurcation in higher education. Online degrees are already less respected than degrees from high-ranking private universities or good public systems (UC&#x2F;UT&#x2F;UM). This bifurcation is not necessarily a bad thing. Those who want job skill training should be able to opt for online programs and be able to land jobs (Think like what Lambda aims to achieve).<p>The wealthy and high-achieving will still go to expensive private universities in person. For everyone else, there should be an accessible means for gainful employment at a fraction of the cost.<p>I see the fundamental issue in higher education being that colleges have become more expensive as they become more comprehensive experiences, but the market forces bachelors degree attainment for even basic employment. The result is that those who don&#x27;t need, or don&#x27;t want, all the luxuries have to subsidize the cost.<p>[0] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.irrodl.org&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;irrodl&#x2F;article&#x2F;view&#x2F;53&#x2F;110\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.irrodl.org&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;irrodl&#x2F;article&#x2F;view&#x2F;53&#x2F;110<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-26 07:06:48"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mathnmusic"],"id":[23307351],"kids":{},"parent":[23307202],"text":["I can see it happening for computer science, law and business, but anything that involves dealing with real physical matter (think rocket propulsion labs, molecular biology labs or even just welding&#x2F;machining shops), we will need physical spaces.

Microsoft w&#x2F; MS Office), but sometimes you wind up being stuck with software that sucks (Ex. Microsoft w&#x2F; Internet Explorer up until Edge came out, and arguably after). Also, you&#x27;re often a permanent beta tester for these tools, which can be frustrating."],"time":["2020-05-26 19:48:39"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["UncleMeat"],"id":[23312070],"kids":{},"parent":[23308723],"text":["1.

(continuation of Triplebyte email)<p>Rather than safeguarding the fact that you are or were job searching, we threatened exposure. Current employers might retaliate if they saw that you were job searching. You did not expect that any personal information you’d given us, in the context of a private, secure job search, would be used publicly without your explicit consent. I sincerely apologize. It was my failure.<p>So, what happened? How did I screw this up? I’ve been asking myself this question a bunch over the past 48 hours. I can point to two factors (which by no means excuse the decision). The first was that the profiles as spec’d were an evolution of a feature we already had (Triplebyte Certificates--these are not default public). I failed to see the significance of “default public” in my head. The second factor was the speed we were trying to move at to respond to the COVID recession. We’re a hiring company and hiring is in crisis. The floor has fallen out on parts of our business, and other parts are under unprecedented growth. We&#x27;ve been in a state of churn as we quickly try various things to adapt. But I let myself get caught in this rush and did not look critically enough at the features we were shipping. Inexcusably, I ignored our users’ very real privacy concerns. This was a breach of trust not only in the decision, but in my actual thought process. The circumstances don’t excuse this. The privacy violation should have been obvious to me from the beginning, and the fact that I did not see this coming was a major failure on my part.<p>Our mission at Triplebyte has always been to build a background-blind hiring process. I graduated at the height of the financial crisis as most companies were doing layoffs (similar to what many recent-grads are experiencing today). My LinkedIn profile and resume had nothing on them other than the name of a school few people had heard of. I applied to over 100 jobs the summer after I graduated, and I remember just never hearing back. I know that a lot of people are going through the same thing right now. I finally got my first job at a company that had a coding challenge rather than a resume screen. They cared about what I could do, not what was on my resume. This was a foundational insight for me. It&#x27;s still the case today, though, that companies rely primarily on resume screens that don’t pick up what most candidates can actually do--making the hiring problem much worse than it needs to be. This is the problem we&#x27;re trying to fix.<p>We believed that we could do so by building a better Linkedin profile that was focused on your skills, rather than where you went to school, where you worked, or who you knew. I still believe there&#x27;s a need for something like this. But to release it as a default public feature was not just a major mistake, it was a betrayal. I&#x27;m ashamed and I&#x27;m sorry.<p>Triplebyte can’t function without the trust of the engineering community. Last Friday I lost a big chunk of that trust. We’re now going to try to earn it back. I’m not sure that’s fully possible, but we have to try. What I will do now is slow down, take a step back, and learn the lessons I need to avoid repeating this.<p>I understand that cancelling this feature does not undo the harm. It’s only one necessary step. Please let me know any other concerns or questions that I can answer (replies to this email go to me). I am sorry to all of you for letting you down.<p>Sincerely,<p>-Ammon"],"time":["2020-05-25 19:35:34"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["lisper"],"id":[23305725],"kids":[23306724],"parent":[23303037],"text":["How did you manage to submit this?

You can unravel abstractions we build on all the way to the bits and bytes and 90% of software is just gluing libraries together. Infact, you could probably describe the entirety of several of big tech cos as &quot;just&quot; gluing libraries together.<p>Anyway, the other argument about salaries is more interesting. Most people seem to agree that there&#x27;s a huge untapped crowd of qualified developers in small &#x2F; mid sized US cities who would love to join $BIGCO but the only reason they aren&#x27;t is because it involves relocation. As an example, a Sr Dev in Orlando, FL makes $100-120k in total comp while one in SF &#x2F; NYC makes $350k+. I limit my search to Sr Devs because I assume college kids are happy to move to exciting cities like NYC &#x2F; SF &#x2F; Seattle on fat relocation checks.<p>My suspicion is that supply and demand have converged already and big tech has mined out the supply of talented devs in the US already. The other datapoint here is that companies have made it as easy as possible for folks to move by opening dev centers wherever there&#x27;s talent - NYC as a tech hub wasn&#x27;t a thing in 2012, but it&#x27;s huge now for all the people who don&#x27;t want to leave the east coast. Boston is pretty big. Colorado, Austin as well.<p>The only way supply of devs is increasing here is if:<p>* Sr Devs who did not move to tech hubs because they preferred to stay where they are. (Personally think this is unlikely)<p>* Qualified Bootcamp graduates<p>* CS Enrollments hitting pretty high numbers, so maybe we&#x27;ll start graduating lots of CS folks.<p>* Immigration reform &#x2F; Outsourcing<p>* Interviewing change so we skip the algo problem solving shenanigans.<p>I personally think if big tech wants to hire in the US and still pay lower $ than they currently do, the only lever they have left to pull is the interviewing format &#x2F; bar."],"time":["2020-05-25 06:44:52"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["programmarchy"],"id":[23298149],"kids":[23298957,23298606,23300191,23298189,23300517,23298192,23301089],"parent":[23297463],"text":["The most salient part of this essay was the last section. Remote-first is forming in a way to break tech labor power. Employees will be less able to bond, and their personal conversations will be easier to spy upon. This will drastically inhibit collectivization. WFH may have some upside, but there’s a huge downside looming.<p>&gt; Remote-First, Collective-Last<p>&gt; Lastly, let’s talk about the impact of remote-first on labor. Many months, before the virus hit, a CEO friend of mine “jokingly” told me that he believed all the “remote” buzz was as much about reducing the collective power of the employees as it was about saving a dime on salaries. He personally did not want his company to go full-remote but was under some pressure from investors to consider it. We were both hammered at the time, and I didn’t put too much thought into it, but it feels right the more I think about it."],"time":["2020-05-25 07:26:03"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["aschla"],"id":[23297736],"kids":[23297825,23297874],"parent":[23297463],"text":["&quot;Say software one more goddamn time!&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t really agree with the point that because we&#x27;re creating things that allow us to use less or no code, there will be less code to write.
