All this can be done for years on a single battery charge and at a cost of pennies per sensor per day.

The possibilities are endless.<p>However, there are two truly difficult problems to solve in the design of a bluetooth smart tag: security, and battery life.

There is a fundamental clash of values between the West and China, and it is clear that China is interested in exporting theirs.

Granted, right now, it’s just Huawei, but gradually, all the other Chinese companies are going to leave, or will be forced out. They now all have a bright red target on their backs.<p>Good luck making all that profit back from just selling to Apple and nVidia. Apple takes the lion’s share of the iPhone profits, and the CPU contract manufacturer takes a small fraction.  Apple only went with TSMC, in order to prevent Samsung, from getting a clue of what they were up to.<p>Next, I predict that this will have further chain reaction consequences.<p>Trump will restrict ASML from selling to China, the photolithography equipment, if they haven’t already. So China will step up their R&amp;D to develop it indigenously.  SMIC just achieved 14-nm, so they’re not so far behind, maybe 5 to 10 years, but they’re reliant on ASML.  So they’re about to get their legs cut off from under them.  The Americans just sucker-punched them. So they’re down, but they’re not out.  Not yet.  They’ll eventually replace ASML, since this is now an existential crisis for them.<p>The next domino to fall, will be Android. When China comes back online with their own competitive CPUs, then Android will be made irrelevant, because Huawei will move forward with their Harmony OS.<p>They are using it now, inside their smart TVs, and this is like a Trojan Horse tactic for them. Use the OS to learn of a non-competitive ecosystem, TVs, and get it ready for the main event, mobile devices and computer systems.<p>With the fall of Android, then Google takes a hit.  Their search engine will no longer be as relevant to mobile users. This leads to a possibly massive reduction of ad revenue, and so forth.<p>Then, as we were all probably expecting, mobile OS and desktop OS are converging. The Harmony OS might also compete against Apple MacOS, and Microsoft Windows.  Thus, in one swoop, Huawei might just knock out 3 American tech giants: Google, Microsoft, and Apple.

A polyfill is a piece of code that provides modern functionality on older browsers that do not natively support it. As Microsoft introduces new APIs, developers link against a package, and if you’re on an older version, Microsoft will polyfill the functionality as best it can to use in the new version. The best part is that these packages will work from a Win32 or UWP app. The collection of packages thus becomes a common API service between Win32 and UWP.

Generally with Julia, you want to allocate memory, once, to avoid penalties of reallocating memory and gc.<p>I pulled the code down, placed the data on a ramdisk so as to not impact benchmark measurements, with physical issues.<p>I built the C code, and ran the two julia codes.

Putting the data on ramdisk optimizes <i>all<\/i> codes.<p>My thoughts:  The author noted that Julia has long startup&#x2F;run times.  This is true, for the first compilation of modules you use.  As a reflex these days I (and I am guessing most Julia users) do a &quot;using $MODULE&quot; after adding it.  This makes the startup times less painful, for most modules used.  Plotting, with the Plots module, is still a problem, though it has gotten dramatically better over time.<p>Basically, if you run your code more than once, with the modules being compiled into your cache, the nice part is that startup time is significantly better.  Such that Python reverts to its lower performance than Julia.

Moreover, you get control over optimization level for each piece of the code separately. Even more, you get complete control over the resulting native assembly. Something you don&#x27;t get to do with other higher level languages.<p>One of the production applications I did in Common Lisp was parsing a stream of XDP messages (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nyse.com&#x2F;publicdocs&#x2F;nyse&#x2F;data&#x2F;XDP_Common_Client_Specification_v2.0.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nyse.com&#x2F;publicdocs&#x2F;nyse&#x2F;data&#x2F;XDP_Common_Client_...<\/a>) with a requirement for very low latency. I made the parser in Common Lisp so that it generates optimal binary code from XML specification of message types, fields, field types, etc. using a bunch of macros.<p>The goal of application was to proxy messages to the actual client of the stream. The proxy was there so that it was possible to introduce changes to the stream in real time without requiring to restart any components. Using REPL I was able to &quot;deploy&quot; any arbitrary transformation on the messages. The actual client of the messages was a black box application that we had no control over but we sometimes had problems with when it received something it did not like.<p>I liked Common Lisp in particular because it does not force you to make your performance decision upfront. You can develop your application using very high level constructs and then you get the option to focus on parts that are critical for your performance. Macros allow you to present DSL to your application but then have full control over code that is actually working beneath the DSL.<p>If everything fails, calling C code is a breeze in Common Lisp compared to other languages."],"time":["2020-05-19 14:20:09"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["enricozb"],"id":[23230075],"kids":[23233075],"parent":[23229657],"text":["Would love to see an FP language on there, preferably OCaml"],"time":["2020-05-19 02:39:39"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ryan-allen"],"id":[23229982],"kids":[23234758],"parent":[23229657],"text":["Crystal is really exciting, it somehow &#x27;fell under the radar&#x27; but when I heard &#x27;fast, and ruby-like with types&#x27; I became very excited.<p>There&#x27;s even a Rails-like [0] framework being developed!<p>Last weekend I spend a couple of hours getting Lucky up and running (it took some doing, I had to borrow a lot from people&#x27;s Docker images to get it booted and working).<p>It&#x27;s a big &#x27;watch this space&#x27; situation.

You must show that there are some things which are important , and other less important. This is not an easy discussion because it requires experience and the ability to say &quot;if this is hacked, never mind&quot; and at the same time fight like your life depended on it to have the small XSS on your corporate site fixed. Not because it is insecure but because it does not look good in newspapers.<p>You also need to discuss awareness. First for them, then for the rest of the company. Because the weak link today is John in accounting who will open the enlarge your penis email end download the attached binary.<p><U+2192> it is difficult to find good resources to learn about these things. Of course there are zillions of books about the subject, usually written by people who have never actually ran the security of a company. At best they were &quot;consultants&quot; who had great ideas, which were unfortunately in another galaxy realism-wise.<p>I would say the best would be to have the opportunity to work with a good CISO and watch him or her belly dance to make their point with management. If they are good you will quickly understand what is important and what is not.<p>2. discussing with technical teams<p>You can expect a competency ratio of 1:4. That is 1 person who knows what they are talking about for 4 others who are either neck deep in technical problems and need to solve these problems, or the ones who learned security as part of their general systems&#x2F;networking curriculum.<p>The best way to integrate such a team is to become a jack of all trades a master of all trades as well. In technical teams, raw technical knowledge counts a lot - especially in technology companies. You get credibility points exponentially when you help to solve a hard technical issue. Best is to look around authentication, machine to machine traffic (and how to secure it) and application security.<p><U+2192> best is to try it out yourself at home. You can run a docker server on a home server and start a few containers. Play with authentication, automated TLS, reverse proxies and filtering, logging.<p>Large enterprise security, technically speaking, is either the same as small enterprise security (multiplied by n servers and services), or really specific (peering, centralized authentication, ...).

It is designed for one to many communication (conferencing&#x2F;webinars)! It does one thing and does it REALLY well. The minimalism helps concentration&#x2F;lowers barrier of entry a lot. Now that WebRTC is getting easier to build things with, I hope to see a lot more special purpose software like this. It is nice having heavyweight video solutions, but attacking the problem from different angles I think is going to bring a lot of innovation as well :)<p>-----<p>Dear colleagues,<p>A friend of mine just did a three-hour first-year lecture over my unnamed\nSFU with 12 students.  The students didn&#x27;t switch on their camera (except\nduring the break), the lecturer was streaming three flows: audio, video,\nand lecture slides.<p>The total amount of network traffic oscillated between 4Mbps and 10Mbps\n(380kps to 800kbps for each receiver), which indicates that the congestion\ncontrol algorithm is working as designed.  The CPU load oscillated between\n10% and 20% (of a $5&#x2F;month VPS), which is more than in previous tests,\nI suspect that the CPU accounting of the VPS I&#x27;m renting is not accurate.<p>Neither the lecturer nor the students (first years, non-STEM) had any\nproblems with the software.  One student reported problems with the video,\nwhich went away after a while.  The students initially complained about the\nprimitive UI (« au début, ça fait un peu peur »), then got used to it\n(« mais après, ça va »).<p>I think the software is ready for a test at larger scale, say, a seminar\nwith a hundred listeners or so.  If anyone is organising a seminar and is\nwilling to take the risk, please let me know.

Feel responsible from day one. You are a part of the team and you are responsible for every failure and every success. More or less. If there is a pain in somewhere in your team, feel it in your heart. In companies, there are always some “local people” and “tourists”. Tourists are only interested in “fancy” things. They follow their interests. They hate problematic situations. They don’t take some much responsibility in case of failure. They always blame decision makers since they never try to be one of them. When they get bored, they just fly to yet another city. In reality, there are lots of limitations and we are not living in a perfect world. Unfortunately they are not aware of this fact. Maybe they are just prefering ignoring it. I don’t know. What I want to say be one of the “local people”. Local people know not only good places of the city but also the suburb. Local people think about how to manage the city, how to “survive” in the city, how to make the city more beautiful. They can live with the bad sides of the city.

Here is what I tell my newbies.<p>Keep a small notebook, or use a to-do app and track everything that gets assigned to you.  If something is assigned to you make sure that you get a clear deliverable time or date and time. If you have any questions about what&#x27;s been assigned to you ask the person who assigned the task, even it your question doesn&#x27;t pop up until later.<p>If you take notes in meeting etc. use a separate notebook or app for the notes.  You want to be sure that you don&#x27;t clutter up your to do list with notes.<p>First thing in the morning:\n- Review your to-do list.  \n- Check your calendar for the day\n- Check your inbox<p>Before you leave at the end of the day:\n- Create a bullet list of everything you did for the day.  \n- Check your calendar for the next day\n- Check your inbox one last time.\n- Check to make sure that you don&#x27;t have any unfinished emails.<p>Learn how to use all the office tools, even if you think they are stupid, lame, outdated.  It&#x27;s what you&#x27;ll be using, complaining won&#x27;t change the fact that you&#x27;ll need to conform.  First impressions.<p>There will be a lot of things that won&#x27;t make sense, roll with it.  Intra and inter system dependencies drive most things that don&#x27;t make sense when you walk into a new place.  Telling people how to do it better won&#x27;t win you any points.<p>Take a few months of your first job and be humble.  Listen more than you talk.  I like to tell new hires to be like a human Golden Retriever.  Positive attitude, want to help always, look like you are smiling all the time.   Don&#x27;t bark unless it&#x27;s absolutely necessary.  Look good at all times.<p>I&#x27;m not suggesting that you completely alter your personality, just ease into things.

Prioritize learning what you didn&#x27;t know you didn&#x27;t know.<p>Don&#x27;t try to be an expert. I call this the &quot;amateur expert&quot; phenomenon. It&#x27;s OK to want to be an expert and to strive for that every day. But it takes time. And the only way to get there is to listen and learn.<p>Be approachable. Don&#x27;t be too busy for people. Yes, everyone appreciates a good work ethic. But it&#x27;s more important for people to want to work with you. If you don&#x27;t make time for other people they won&#x27;t make time for you.<p>Don&#x27;t make it a goal to impress anyone. Your work will speak for itself. Focus on making steady progress every day and you will naturally stand out.<p>Triple your estimates. No matter what you&#x27;re asked to do, until you&#x27;ve done it several times it will take you a long longer than you expect. If you have the option to influence how much time you&#x27;re given to do the work, under commit and over deliver. This is way more important than some people think.<p>Be nice to others, but not too nice. If you&#x27;re super nice to people, they&#x27;ll expect that from you every day. And when you have the inevitable &quot;off day&quot;, people will get way more upset with you just because it&#x27;s such a big contrast. So be nice, clearly. But again, let it flow naturally. Don&#x27;t try too hard.<p>Learn how to make mistakes well by placing small bets and learning from your mistakes. You&#x27;re going to screw up. Sometimes you&#x27;ll screw up and people will tell you. But if you keep screwing up two things will happen. First, people will stop giving you opportunities and you&#x27;ll eventually wither and probably either leave on your own or be asked to leave by your boss. Second, people will stop telling you when you screw up. They will lose faith in you. And this is a terrible place to be. Avoid this at all costs by simply learning from your mistakes.<p>Batch up your questions. As you learn all the ins and outs of a new environment you&#x27;ll have many, many questions. And no matter how much you learn over time, every time you move to a new environment you&#x27;ll go through this process again. You&#x27;ll see things in the code that don&#x27;t make obvious sense. You&#x27;ll have ideas about how to improve things. Some things will start to make sense as you just spend more time with them. Other things you will need help with. What you want to do is try to be as efficient with other people&#x27;s time as you can. If you ask questions constantly it will begin to annoy your co-workers, even if they say it&#x27;s ok. So write down your questions as they come up. Make an honest effort to figure things out on your own. Then schedule time once a week or so with more senior people. They&#x27;ll appreciate you making it so easy for them to help you and some of them may even become your champions.<p>Invest in relationships. As you take on more and more responsibility your ability to influence other people will become more and more important. It won&#x27;t be enough to simply solve problems. People won&#x27;t follow you just because you have answers or experience. But when people feel connected to you and know that you care about them as people, they will want you to succeed and go a long way to help.<p>Continue to learn on your own time. You will have some opportunities to learn on the job. But you will also make a lot of mistakes as you learn. Think of the time you invest outside of the office as study time and what you do in the office as the test. Contributing to an open source project is a great way to try things out and get feedback from people with more experience.<p>I wish you the best out there.

But it seems so early to make these kinds of definite proclamations. There is <i>so much<\/i> about the virus and how it&#x27;s transmitted that we still don&#x27;t understand. The UK government had no idea what they were doing, but really neither does anyone else. And until we are a little further along in successfully containing this epidemic, it&#x27;s not going to be clear what the best course of action was.<p>Here are some of the most basic things no one seems to have figured out yet:<p>- As of today, there have been 23,953 deaths in England. Of those, exactly 33(!) involve someone &lt;= age 40 without a co-morbidity. Across all ages, 95%(!) of deaths are people with a co-morbidity, typically diabetes (26%). Why does this disease attack so many diabetic people? What should we do to best treat or prevent it in that population? [1]<p>- Why is the transmission rate in London so low now (R = 0.4, &lt; 25 infections a day) while still high everywhere else in the UK (R = 0.7 - 08)? Is that because the lockdown in London is somehow different or better or because some critical segment of the population is immune now and slowing down transmission? Or something else? [2]<p>- Why weren&#x27;t the Nightingale Hospitals (field hospitals) needed? Were we just wrong about the need for ventilation? Was the lockdown super effective? Or something else?<p>- How many people are currently immune? Different studies in place the immunity rate in London anywhere from 10% (tests) to 29% (statistical models). Several studies suggest that there is significant cross-immunity with preexisting coronaviruses causing much slower spread, but it&#x27;s too early to know for sure and that could be totally wrong.<p>- Why do some scientists think this will be a serious, on-going epidemic and others think the disease will &quot;burn itself out&quot; [3]? Is that based on science or wishful thinking? Because the difference in the best course of action would be significantly different if we knew the answer with a strong degree of certainty.<p>- Why do some places with lax lock downs have lower death rates than places with severe lock downs? Why aren&#x27;t we seeing big upticks in deaths in the US where they are just willy nilly opening the economy? Is it just lagging indicators or are we not totally sure yet how this disease spreads in the community?<p>- How soon will we get an effective therapeutic? Will we really have a somewhat effective vaccine from Oxford in September or might we never have a vaccine? Will it matter anyway as immunity builds up in the population? How long are people immune?<p>- What is the actual cost of locking down in terms of lives lost as a side effect in the long term due to economic, social and psychological effects? Is it minuscule or significant?<p>Again, there will be plenty of time to bash the UK government after this is over. But it seems very early to be proclaiming that anyone has any idea what the right course of action was. This epidemic could totally vanish this year or it could go on for years. No one has any idea.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.england.nhs.uk&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;statistical-work-areas&#x2F;covid-19-daily-deaths&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.england.nhs.uk&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;statistical-work-areas...<\/a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk&#x2F;now-casting&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk&#x2F;now-casting&#x2F;<\/a><p>[3] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.telegraph.co.uk&#x2F;news&#x2F;2020&#x2F;05&#x2F;16&#x2F;coronavirus-could-burn-naturally-vaccine-not-needed-former-director&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.telegraph.co.uk&#x2F;news&#x2F;2020&#x2F;05&#x2F;16&#x2F;coronavirus-coul...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-19 12:31:26"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["GEBBL"],"id":[23232980],"kids":[23233088],"parent":[23232678],"text":["And at the end of all this, you guys have Brexit.

They’ve also been challenging for Uber, and many of you, as you’ve waited for us to define the road ahead. I’ve said clearly that we had to take tough action to resize our company to the new reality of our business, and that I would come back to you this week with the specifics.<p>Today I have the specifics: we have made the incredibly difficult decision to reduce our workforce by around 3,000 people, and to reduce investments in several non-core projects. As a leadership team we had to take the time to make the right decisions, to ensure that we are treating our people well, and to make certain that we could walk you through our decision making in the sort of detailed and transparent manner you deserve.<p>Where we started and hard choices<p>We began 2020 on an accelerated path to total company profitability. Then the coronavirus hit us with a once-in-a-generation public health and economic crisis. People are rightfully staying home, and our Rides business, our main profit generator, is down around 80%. We’re seeing some signs of a recovery, but it comes off of a deep hole, with limited visibility as to its speed and shape.<p>You’ve heard me say it before: hope is not a strategy. While that’s easy to say, the truth is that this is a decision I struggled with. Our balance sheet is strong, Eats is doing great, Rides looks a little better, maybe we can wait this damn virus out...I wanted there to be a different answer. Let me talk to a few more CEOs...maybe one of them will tell me some good news, but there simply was no good news to hear. Ultimately, I realized that hoping the world would return to normal within any predictable timeframe, so we could pick up where we left off on our path to profitability, was not a viable option.<p>I knew that I had to make a hard decision, not because we are a public company, or to protect our stock price, or to please our Board or investors. I had to make this decision because our very future as an essential service for the cities of the world—our being there for millions of people and businesses who rely on us—demands it. We must establish ourselves as a self-sustaining enterprise that no longer relies on new capital or investors to keep growing, expanding, and innovating.<p>We have to take these hard actions to stand strong on our own two feet, to secure our future, and to continue on our mission.<p>I know that none of this will make it any easier for our friends and colleagues affected by the actions we are taking today. To those of you personally impacted, I am truly sorry. I know this will cause pain for you and your families, especially now. Many of you will be affected not because of the quality of your work, but because of strategic decisions we made to discontinue certain areas of activity, or projects that are no longer necessary, or simply because of the stark reality we face. You have been a huge part of this company and every day forward we will build on the foundations that you established, brick by brick.<p>Our decisions and the road forward<p>We have decided to re-focus our efforts on our core. If there is one silver lining regarding this crisis, it’s that Eats has become an even more important resource for people at home and for restaurants; and delivery, whether of groceries or other local goods, is not only an increasing part of everyday life, it is here to stay. We no longer need to look far for the next enormous growth opportunity: we are sitting right on top of one. I will caution that while Eats growth is accelerating, the business today doesn’t come close to covering our expenses. I have every belief that the moves we are making will get Eats to profitability, just as we did with Rides, but it’s not going to happen overnight.<p>So we need to fundamentally change the way we operate. We need to make some really hard decisions about what we will and won’t do going forward, based on a few principles:<p>We are organizing around our core: helping people move, and delivering things.<p>We are building a cost-efficient structure that avoids layers and duplication and can scale, at speed.<p>We are being intentional with our location strategy focused on key markets&#x2F;hubs.<p>Mac will now lead a unified Mobility team, which will include Rides and, as of today, Transit. Mac will continue to manage our cross-cutting functions like Safety &amp; Insurance, CommOps, U4B, and Business Development, the latter of which will be centralized across Rides, Eats, and Freight under Jen. Pierre will lead what we will call “Delivery” internally, encompassing Eats, Grocery and Direct.<p>Given the necessary cost cuts and the increased focus on core, we have decided to wind down the Incubator and AI Labs and pursue strategic alternatives for Uber Works. Due to these decisions, Zhenya has decided it makes sense to move on from Uber. Zhenya is customer-centric to her core, and I am deeply grateful for all of her hard work.<p>We are also looking at our geographic footprint. While it served us well for many years to cast a wide physical net, it’s time to be more intentional about where we have employees on the ground. We are closing or consolidating around 45 office locations globally, including winding down Pier 70 in San Francisco and moving some of those colleagues to our new HQ in SF. And over the next 12 months we will begin the process of winding down our Singapore office and moving to a new APAC hub in a market where we operate our services.<p>Having learned my own personal lesson about the unpredictability of the world from the punch-in-the-gut called COVID-19, I will not make any claims with absolute certainty regarding our future. I will tell you, however, that we are making really, really hard choices now, so that we can say our goodbyes, have as much clarity as we can, move forward, and start to build again with confidence.<p>How we are helping departing employees<p>As we previewed last week, we have taken a lot of feedback and worked to provide strong severance benefits and other support for those leaving Uber, like healthcare coverage and an alumni talent directory. We’re also taking care to support people in special situations a bit differently, like those on US visas or parental leaves. While the details will differ slightly by country, you can see a summary here. Every departing employee will have a 1:1 to receive the details of their individual package.<p>Given the global nature of these changes, and the local rules and regulations involved, the individual experience today will vary by country:<p>All other countries (those not listed to the right)<p>Argentina, China, France, Germany, India, Ireland (COE only), Italy, Kenya, Netherlands, Norway, Pakistan (Karachi only), Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, South Africa, Spain, Turkey, UK (ULL only)<p>In these countries, we can communicate about individual impacts today.<p>Everyone in these countries who is affected has already received an email, and will soon have a calendar invitation to a private meeting with a manager and HR.<p>If you are in one of these countries and you did not receive a separate email this morning, you are not affected.<p>In these countries, local laws mean that we cannot be as specific about individual impacts today.<p>In some countries, we will start a consultation process. In others, there are restrictions on making changes during the COVID lockdown.<p>If you are in one of these countries, you will get an email from Nikki describing next steps for your location.<p>If you are one of the many affected Uber teammates, I’ll acknowledge right here that any package we offer, regardless of how thoughtful or generous, will never replace the opportunity to belong, to make a difference, to establish the kinds of bonds you establish with any important company or cause. We wouldn’t be here without you. We will finish what you started, and we will be excited to see the great things that you will build next.<p>I am incredibly thankful to <i>everyone<\/i> reading this email, because the resilience and grit you’ve shown has made Uber the company it is and will continue to be. I’ve never had a harder day professionally than today, but Uber has consistently surprised me with the challenges it has thrown my way. But it’s the toughest challenges that are worthwhile, and I know even more strongly in my heart than I ever have that Uber is worth it, and more.<p>Dara"],"time":["2020-05-18 17:31:34"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["schnable"],"id":[23228763],"kids":[23229055,23234860,23228974,23229800],"parent":[23223335],"text":["Are they going to regret having 4,000 micro services now?"],"time":["2020-05-18 23:47:14"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["michaelyoshika"],"id":[23227978],"kids":[23228113,23228040,23229590],"parent":[23223335],"text":["Am I the only one feeling that we should be thankful that these unicorns (whether actually profitable or driven by crazy VC money) have created so many jobs in the past several years?"],"time":["2020-05-18 22:30:54"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["netcan"],"id":[23227467],"kids":{},"parent":[23223335],"text":["Uber is very vulnerable.<p>They still make a large loss every year.

The idea ultimately pivoted into google maps for restaurant menus. Meaning companies would just pay me a service fee to incorporate these menus into their services (ordering food, review sites, restaurant apps, etc.)<p>I self-funded the idea and after my first beta launch (2006, I believe) I was pitching an angle investor (Mr. X) who years later became an early investor in Doordash.<p>Right away, Mr. X said why not go into online food ordering business and then may be do delivery, etc. I never liked the idea of dealing with all the transaction headaches and told him I wasn&#x27;t sure about the idea and dealing with so many fragmented restaurant softwares. From what I could gather attending a few National Restaurant Association events in Chicago and speaking with lots of restaurant owners, I noticed two categories. Very small mom and pop operations, or small medium chains. All the small to medium chains already had invested into some technology layer (some were closed off) and unless you could integrate with them, there was no interest to working with you and the smaller mom pop entities were either too busy or they were so bombarded by all types of tech solution offerings that they didn&#x27;t want to listen to you.<p>Years later when Mr. X had invested in Doordash I had private chat with him.<p>I told him in my opinion, restaurant delivery is restaurant business. Meaning that it&#x27;ll be very hard to compete. On top of one huge exception. You never crave DoorDash, you crave pizza or burger or Chinese food.<p>When the OP says Dominos figured out the model as did lots of family owned Chinese restaurants. I can understand that.<p>I believe this is a very vertical business. For one thing it&#x27;s mostly around the brand, and the brand experience. This is the same reason Starbucks avoided franchising (if you think about it, DoorDash is a bit like franchising a delivery business) as did In-N-Out. These smart people had already figured out the nature of building a food brand experience.<p>Getting a cold food, soggy pizza destroys the brand.<p>This is very different than Amazon or UPS delivering books. Because delivery of books or jackets doesn&#x27;t impact the brand at the same level it does with food. Not to mention when you don&#x27;t deal with risk of food getting cold you can really scale delivery by mastering routing and all the different things UPS can do with scale.<p>Ultimately, we either see a very vertical experience. Uber buying several popular food category chains (pizza, burgers, fried chicken, etc.) or the reverse, PEPSI&#x27;s parent company buying UberEats&#x2F;Grubhub or if there is a massive consolidations and Uber or Grubhub can charge in an economically sustainable way."],"time":["2020-05-18 06:37:41"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["vowelless"],"id":[23225130],"kids":{},"parent":[23216852],"text":["So funny how this mirrors the pizza app thing from HBO Silicon Vally."],"time":["2020-05-18 19:05:35"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["RobLach"],"id":[23220499],"kids":{},"parent":[23216852],"text":["I think I finally understand &quot;growth hacking&quot;."],"time":["2020-05-18 12:10:32"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["WorldPeas"],"id":[23239711],"kids":{},"parent":[23216852],"text":["Maybe they should rebrand as sliceline."],"time":["2020-05-19 22:23:26"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["foobaw"],"id":[23224440],"kids":{},"parent":[23216852],"text":["i know no lawyer wants to provide conclusive opinion here, but this has to be illegal"],"time":["2020-05-18 18:19:58"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["SergeAx"],"id":[23218881],"kids":{},"parent":[23216852],"text":["&gt; If capitalism is driven by a search for profit, the food delivery business confuses the hell out of me.<p>The modern Silicon valley venture capitalism is not about operational profit, it&#x27;s about company valuation."],"time":["2020-05-18 08:00:52"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["linsomniac"],"id":[23222057],"kids":{},"parent":[23216852],"text":["&quot;Isn&#x27;t business supposed to solve problems?&quot;<p>This is a common misconception...

Capitalism is broken.<p>In order for capitalism to work, there has to be a meaningful profit&#x2F;loss <i>incentive<\/i>. People who are doing the work must get rewarded if the work is done well and penalized if the work is done poorly.<p>We already started moving away from this many years ago with the growth of large corporations. When was the last time that you at your &quot;capitalist&quot; firm were aware of revenue and costs for the things you were working on in a more-than-superficial way? When was the last time you saw someone make a buy-vs.-build decision based on the actual numerical cost of the employees needed to run the project and not just handwaving? (When was the last time you even knew what the cost of the employees on your team was, given the widespread taboos about compensation?) When was the last time that someone who said &quot;I saved the company X million dollars&quot; got some proportion of those X million dollars? When was the last time that someone who needlessly made the company spend X million dollars in the first place paid for it?<p>The function of a big company is to abstract away the cold, unfeeling invisible hand of the market and protect people&#x2F;groups who make unprofitable decisions. This is actually totally fine and good in the short term - nobody makes consistently good decisions, and insurance is a thing for a reason. You want people to take bigger risks on behalf of the company than they&#x27;re willing to subsidize with their own paychecks, which is <i>why<\/i> individual artisans and professionals team up to form a company in the first place. But it&#x27;s grown past that. As the article points out, some regional director somewhere is able to <i>convince other people at the company that their work is profitable<\/i> - with no hard link to whether the work is, in fact, profitable. And that scenario is entirely plausible for all of us; it&#x27;s not specific to this one company in any way. If you&#x27;re in the unlucky position where both you want to draw good charts and everyone around you wants to see good charts, there&#x27;s no real way to figure out if you&#x27;re wrong unless the company as a whole is dying, and there might be a host of reasons why it&#x27;s not dying that have nothing to do with your decision-making.<p>And now venture &quot;capitalists&quot; have decided that this model needs to scale out from protecting teams to protecting entire companies. You can run a business for years without even attempting to make a profit and get acquired based on the potential of the business. No more messy realities of the market determining whether you are in fact profitable or not - what matters is whether you <i>look<\/i> profitable. And, again, this is genuinely good at small scale, because it allows new ventures to ignore bumps and potholes that would otherwise have ended a small company. But if you scale it up, it also allows new ventures to ignore driving straight off a cliff.<p>I expect capitalism to work very well if implemented right.

My best practise is to only look at your region when your selected language has regional variations. However, that&#x27;s true for most of the popular languages which is why it isn&#x27;t as easy as the article suggests.<p>For example, your browser&#x27;s language is set to English. Cool.

Don&#x27;t worry, I&#x27;ll give you the appropriate version of our Spanish translations then. French? You in Canada or France? Portuguese, Brazil or Portugal?<p>Not to mention, when you&#x27;re operating in a lot of languages, and your application is in active development, you&#x27;re constantly sending out copy for translation. Different translators have different turnaround times and they don&#x27;t always make it into the release schedule. So, what happens when a translation is missing in a particular language? First we fall back to another region for the same language, then we fall back to English. American English to be specific -- that&#x27;s the language the developers and product managers write in so there&#x27;s always an American English translation.<p>Then, we also allow the user to override their browser settings and pick whichever language they want. That is saved to their user profile so wherever they&#x27;re logged in they&#x27;ll get the language they have set for our applications.<p>So ya, we give you your configured language whenever possible.
