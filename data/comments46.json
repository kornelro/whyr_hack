I&#x27;ve tried many different things to motivate myself to either abstain from behavior like smoking or to keep up healthy streaks.<p>An example would be a promise I made last Christmas to my fiancée. I&#x27;ve had a hard time quitting smoking because it&#x27;s my go-to solution when life is stressful and feels like the walls are coming down. I gave her 500€ and told her that money is for a small holiday for us next summer if I don&#x27;t smoke. If I smoke she can keep it all and use it for whatever she wants.<p>Now when I wanted to smoke, I&#x27;d have to weigh the decision against that promise. The downside was, I had a clear price that I could decide to pay if I wanted a cigarette. Needless to say, I failed in two months and now she has a new sewing machine.<p>On the other hand, I&#x27;ve now managed to keep a 45 day streak on duolingo. It&#x27;s a way smaller thing and there&#x27;s nothing externally motivating me except that damn little owl and a little lit flame icon displaying my streak. There&#x27;s no penalty for failing nor is there any way to wiggle out of failing if I choose not to do my daily exercises. My main motivation is just to learn Welsh for the sake of it and I find it much easier to keep this up than any other habit which comes with internal or external pressure.<p>Making your friends hold you accountable to something just sounds like the recipe for getting unmotivated and losing the actual goal and swapping the enjoyment of doing something into fear of some sort of penalty which one could decide was worth facing.<p>I&#x27;ve also heard that talking too much of your ideas and goals will decrease motivation as you gain some feeling of success which should be rewarded to you after you&#x27;ve actually done the deed. I feel that this personally affects me and I&#x27;ve stopped talking about goals and I&#x27;m just trying to reach them and celebrating afterwards."],"time":["2020-09-06 16:06:26"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["fsiefken"],"id":[24389944],"kids":[24390296],"parent":[24389064],"text":["For those using taskwarrior, there is karmawarrior for lightweight gamification\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.com&#x2F;BlackEdder&#x2F;karmawarrior\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.com&#x2F;BlackEdder&#x2F;karmawarrior<\/a>"],"time":["2020-09-06 10:36:31"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mvind"],"id":[24389553],"kids":[24389935,24389982],"parent":[24389064],"text":["It is weird how we have normalized the fact we need an app to remind us to drink water, or work for one hour.

Higher-order interactive theorem provers enable the formalization of arbitrary mathematical theories and thereby present an interesting, open-ended challenge for deep learning. We provide an open-source framework based on the HOL Light theorem prover that can be used as a reinforcement learning environment. HOL Light comes with a broad coverage of basic mathematical theorems on calculus and the formal proof of the Kepler conjecture, from which we derive a challenging benchmark for automated reasoning. We also present a deep reinforcement learning driven automated theorem prover, DeepHOL, with strong initial results on this benchmark.<\/i>"],"time":["2020-09-06 18:31:06"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["thomasahle"],"id":[24390125],"kids":[24390786,24390656,24390349],"parent":[24389058],"text":["I wonder why they don&#x27;t mention any work based on transformer architectures?

You’d need an aprint() to complement print(), and so on, each returning an awaitable to be awaited.<p>&gt; This is one of the unfortunate downsides of async&#x2F;await. I strongly prefer conventional, preemptive concurrency, but we don’t always have that luxury.<p>I was sceptical about Golang for a long time, but recently I&#x27;ve started practicing it. It&#x27;s designed with concurrency in mind from very beginning and goroutines have advantages of both cooperative and preemptive multitasking. And also it doesn&#x27;t have GIL, so your goroutines will use all available CPUs without any additional effort from your side.<p>From programmers point of view, coding with goroutines looks exactly like coding with use of pthreads (even simpler, in fact). So, there are no function &quot;coloring&quot;, no need in sync&#x2F;async library flavors and so on. But these &quot;threads&quot; also have cost close to cost of python coroutines. It sounds too good to be true, but I&#x27;ve rewritten bunch of my Python&#x2F;asyncio code in Go and I can say it&#x27;s true.

I found both pro- and anti-&quot;protest&quot; accounts with video. Even the pro-protest account videos debunk the narrative that these are peaceful African-American protestors. Whenever one lets the mask slip or shows her hands or hair, it&#x27;s a young white person. These are night time riots, plain and simple. Surveillance footage released by law enforcement shows that Mike Reinoehl loaded and cocked his weapon lying in wait before he murdered Aaron Danielson. Even the people generally sympathetic to the antiprotest viewpoint are able to publish their narratives using videos <i>from the pro-&quot;protest&quot; side<\/i>! Even the Kenosha story, the one we cant tell on Facebook, is largely misreported.[1]<p>At this point, these Antifa people (who &quot;don&#x27;t exist,&quot; yet all show up at the same time and place in a uniform and are even aware enough to know who is and isn&#x27;t allowed to film), the mainstream reporting, the Democrats and Leftist activists seem to want me to believe their words over my lying eyes. I don&#x27;t anymore. The illusion is shattered.<p>I&#x27;m a bit embarrassed that people who profess to be hackers in our industry are actively allowing themselves to be cannibalized by a narrative that is controlled by those with power over information. Ever since I was a kid, wresting access to information from a powerful, ruthless elite is what motivated me to be a programmer and hacker. I couldn&#x27;t put it into those terms, but it&#x27;s the same sentiment from my first exposure at age 12. When a billionaire self-described hacker uses his authority as the creator of the largest online social network on earth to censor any evidence that goes against a certain narrative, even to the point of blacklisting, he has ceased to be a hacker, as have any employees who continue to be accomplices in this increasingly absurd information warfare operation.<p>I have no doubt that many of these people believe they are doing the right thing, but they themselves have been cracked and don&#x27;t even know it or are too fragile to resist. Anytime anyone says &quot;you can&#x27;t say &lt;X&gt; and you can&#x27;t look at the evidence we don&#x27;t endorse,&quot; I&#x27;m suspicious. Yet that is what we see right now.<p>The largest social networking site in the world will ban posts and even accounts for saying a certain narrative. The largest video platform in the world boosts the &quot;reliable sources&quot; mentioned in the article, and only puts less curated information after it. And the bird application uses trumped up bans, shadowbans and selective enforcement of policies.<p>When did hacker culture sell its soul?<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=7ro8hkfBDVw\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=7ro8hkfBDVw<\/a>"],"time":["2020-09-06 16:37:49"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["nphd"],"id":[24395330],"kids":{},"parent":[24390909],"text":["Wow I kinda thought the article would go into police departments and unions paying social media management firms to send bad-faith takedown notices for YouTube videos that cast them in a bad light, but uhh yeah some protesters are kinda trying to do the same thing with far less resources."],"time":["2020-09-07 01:01:46"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[24391136],"kids":{},"parent":[24390909],"text":{},"time":["2020-09-06 15:25:48"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":["Simulacra"],"id":[24393432],"kids":{},"parent":[24390909],"text":["&quot;A little firey, mostly peaceful.&quot;"],"time":["2020-09-06 20:19:30"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["skmurphy"],"id":[24395135],"kids":{},"parent":[24390909],"text":["Journalism is a key element of our collective civic sensemaking.

He spent months going back &amp; forth with wild accusations &amp; unspecified concerns. After dozens and dozens of exchanges, he finally named one single scenario, that people might &quot;hide&quot; their tracking malware by renaming files as they put them into the bundle.<p>Color me extremely unimpressed &amp; unscared. Enormous sound &amp; fury, for a capability that is in no way different from the web we already have today. It&#x27;s not hard to setup a.webserver to randomize asset names. Nothing about webbundles is new or changes that.<p>Consensual Delusions like this hacked up hoax of a story threaten reality as we know it. As the old civic videos say: DONT BE A SUCKER. Anyone selling fear, uncertainty, &amp; doubt is to be met with skepticism. Increasingly, FUD is how Apple&#x2F;Mozilla&#x2F;Brave are selling their anti-feature policy. &quot;Trust us, we won&#x27;t let the web work with midi&quot; doesn&#x27;t sound that great, but is much more honest than what we get, which is &quot;these engineers &amp; standards groups working on these specs are secretly trying to undermine this treasured web which we must protect &amp; keep as is at all costs&quot;. the involved engineer&#x27;s histories indicates they obviously care enormously about bettering the web, &amp; in this case are combatting sizable transpiling tool bloat for devs, &amp; enabling offline sharing &amp; offline capable web, and literally fighting censorship, which are truly worthy goals all that will vastly help the web.<p>This is all super hard to work through. Yes, google used the web to reap enormous profit by means of enormous information control &amp; inventory systems for ads &amp; eyeballs. But Google also would not exist without the web, &amp; historically the web was a small toy that couldn&#x27;t do much compared to apps. The tables have turned, &amp; the web is clearly ascendant, much safer, &amp; increasingly we understand that the limitations of ux were largely from lack of will to explore &amp; test what limits there really were, so the situation is no longer so obviously tense. But Google Chrome &amp; Chromium &amp; the spec work Google does are, imo, designed to improve a communal shared resource for all humanity, designed to greaten the web, not subvert it.  We can see that here, as the engineers working on webbundle have shown a thousand times over their commitment to honest above board clear integrity as they have tried &amp; tried &amp; tried to work with Peter Snyder as he fumbled &amp; plodded his way to a scenario where WebBundles pose any real danger, &amp; Peter has imo failed at presenting anything. We can see the engineers take Peter seriously, try to work with him. And so I feel it is in general. It is intimating as hell that the web is so big, has so many capabilities, that so much keeps getting added, and so much of that comes from gigantic unimaginably huge pools of capital derived from eyeballs-on-screen. But somehow it has been working out, the engineers have genuinely cared about doing the right thing, &amp; usually the standards bodies &amp; TAG can eventually come to harmony &amp; agree, &amp; the web improves.<p>Peters dissent thread:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;WICG&#x2F;webpackage&#x2F;issues&#x2F;551\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;WICG&#x2F;webpackage&#x2F;issues&#x2F;551<\/a><p>Personally I greatly look forward to WebBundles.

I have it rigged up so well in Emacs that it doesn&#x27;t distract me from my thinking of the actual problem.<p>A somewhat relevant story: One time, I was sitting on a park bench in my neighborhood, with a battered old laptop, doing some heavy semi-mechanical high-volume editing that didn&#x27;t require much thinking. I was throwing a lot of rapid Emacs window management, isearch, ad hoc keyboard macros, etc. at it, and the task didn&#x27;t require much second-guessing, which I suppose resulted in a lot of almost Hollywood-like &quot;programming&#x2F;hacking&quot; rapidly changing windows of computer-y text on my screen, extend highlights flashing, syntax coloring updating, etc.  At some point, some of the people who were arriving for a pickup soccer game in the park gathered round, and were just watching, and when I got to a stopping point, were kinda cheering and congratulating me (I think I didn&#x27;t speak any of their languages), and one gave me a high-five.  That brief moment of being nerdy-cool totally wouldn&#x27;t have happened in notepad.exe, and, also, my task wouldn&#x27;t have been tractable in that.

I try new tools recreationally, and am also doing a complicated startup in which I have to do All The Things.  But there are some tools I end up keeping going back to, after trying other things, because they really do seem to pay off in productivity.)<p>That said, apparently, the way Carmack personally uses editors, and what he gets from them, any old editor will work about as well as any other.

I don&#x27;t bling it out with Spacemacs, Doom, or any of the other things people install these days. I sound&#x2F;feel like a boomer railing against kids with their Minecrafting and Roblocks and social medias. But the point is, my Emacs workflow is reflective of the fact that I don&#x27;t use Emacs because it gives me some huge needed leverage over the <i>act of writing code<\/i>. That is relatively straightforward, and the plain Emacs bindings, once learned, are more than suitable to the task.<p>Rather, I use Emacs because of a combination of pain points that it simply handles better than other editors, that add up to a significant advantage:<p>* Emacs does electric indent &quot;right&quot;. Other editors will attempt to indent automatically, but the tab key always means &quot;insert tab&quot;, not &quot;indent this line to its computed indent level&quot;. This alone makes it more pleasant to use than most &quot;modern&quot; code editors.<p>* By default, Emacs will help you match paired delimiters (parens, brackets, quotes, etc.) but will not insert closing delimiters. This saves me that awkward experience of typing out a code block, parameter list, or string constant, only to find that I now have mismatched delimiters because I didn&#x27;t realize I was supposed to cursor over the closing delimiter my editor oh-so-helpfully provided rather than type it myself. Except some editors just cursor over the closing delimiter if it senses that you&#x27;re typing the delimiter at point. Some don&#x27;t, though, and it&#x27;s hard to remember which is which!<p>* I work a lot in Lisp, and Emacs is better suited to handling Lisp code than most other editors.<p>* Emacs is an immensely useful <i>programming environment<\/i>. There are <i>applications<\/i> like Magit and Org-mode built on top of Emacs that are just stupid useful workflow grease. On top of that, if there are pain points in my workflow, coding something up in Emacs Lisp to handle them is incredibly easy and straightforward, and I can evaluate and test my code right in my running Emacs session. Contrary to popular belief, Emacs integrates well with Unix tooling; Unix tools can be easily plumbed together with Emacs buffers, enabling you to use Emacs as a kind of &quot;super-shell&quot; to capture, move, examine, and massage data."],"time":["2020-09-07 10:13:54"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["melling"],"id":[24394098],"kids":[24394224,24395851],"parent":[24393987],"text":["I just signed up for <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;repl.it&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;repl.it&#x2F;<\/a><p>I’d like to kick back on my couch and code for an hour using my iPad and Apple Pencil.<p>I’m anxiously awaiting for someone to image a better mobile experience rather than attaching a hardware keyboard."],"time":["2020-09-06 21:45:39"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Const-me"],"id":[24394228],"kids":[24394244],"parent":[24393987],"text":["Not sure I agree.

Are you concerned about hiding from pissed off gamers, hacktivists, or a nation state? Knowing the enemy you face will help you better understand their potential capabilities to find out information about you and how they could use this information.<p>3. Assess your vulnerabilities. Look at yourself from the viewpoint of the attacker. What information would you use to dox yourself?<p>4. Assess your risk. This can also be pretty involved depending on your vulnerabilities and threats. What could someone do with this information? How bad could you be hurt?<p>5. Apply countermeasures. Figure out how you can mitigate the risk you found above. This may include closing old accounts, creating new accounts, creating alternate personas, disinformation, heading off potential impact from a dox, etc.<p>Hope my ramblings helped."],"time":["2020-09-06 05:00:14"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["dcow"],"id":[24389220],"kids":[24389351,24389959],"parent":[24388442],"text":["Find the courage to post under your real identity.

Amusingly, we’re quite similar to Paris in that the SFMTA “farebox recovery ratio” (fare revenue divided by costs) is in the 25% range [2].<p>That low funding rate (75% through taxes then) is despite fairly large increases in the fare over time. IIRC, the youth &#x2F; senior Pass was $10 in 2007 and is now $40, the regular was $50 and is now... $81 (and set to increase in January [3]). Somewhat rationally, it seems this was all connected to indexing the fares to Bay Area inflation [4], designed so that salary of the drivers keeps up with inflation.<p>Like Paris though, we have (had) a large tourist contingent that pays full fare when visiting. Some argue that “they’re not taxpayers, make them buy tickets”, but it seems more efficient to just account for that in hotel taxes.

The guy only had a BA too. I was horrified when I read this, but significant enough results were achieved and the field is just about devoid of anything with predictive power currently sadly. Also the underling statistics were done in the early 1980&#x27;s and forms of media change, so I&#x27;m not sure if the technique would even yield usable results today.<p>Other things that are interesting about earthquakes:<p>1. The moon plays some role. The gravitational pull of the moon is enough to influence the tension on the crust. Scientists have struggled to yield anything predictive from this, but the math suggests the forces must have some effect<p>2. Plate tectonics plays less of a role than previously thought. The classic example is China. No major plate boundaries where new crust is being formed (like off the coast of Japan) or of volcanic hotspots (Hawaii), yet an absolutely devastating history of earthquakes that are well recorded going back 3,000 years or so.<p>3. The influence of large weighted bodies on earthquakes.

I built my whole company around this idea [0], so I&#x27;m definitely biased.<p>I know that many might disagree with me on this, but shattering copyright is not going to do us, the society, any favors. If you, as I, believe that automation is going exceedingly take over more of our responsibilities, IP (intellectual property) [read creativity] is the only thing left to us as humans. While many believe copyright is about extortion of money, I believe it&#x27;s about proper attribution. This is the founding principle behind Creative Commons which believes that credits needs to be given to the creators. If they choose to make money of their creation, that&#x27;s their right and should be followed.<p>I do believe that with transparent rules and removed ambiguity the UGC market will thrive beyond what we seen so far. You can see glimpses of what&#x27;s possible through platforms like TikTok or Triller that do acquire licenses and are in process of paying creators portion of the revenue. This was one of the most important innovations of YouTube that spurred a whole new market and paved the way for many new platforms.<p>Imagine that you, as a creator, could know instantly which content of other people can you use under what conditions. If you disagree with them, you just don&#x27;t use it and choose something else. Especially in music, this gives you a freedom of selection. There is 80M songs. There will be always enough to choose from, even if the major righpshodlers would withhold their catalogues.<p>I believe that if the rules are know, are stable and unambiguous, then the market will be much stronger and healthier for everyone.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pex.com&#x2F;attribution-engine&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pex.com&#x2F;attribution-engine&#x2F;<\/a>"],"time":["2020-09-04 20:19:03"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["IronWolve"],"id":[24377164],"kids":{},"parent":[24371349],"text":["My favorite is when reporters are out in the field reporting and someone drives by with their car radio on, and the entire clip gets taken down due to copyright.<p>Streamers listening to music is a common thing while talking, gaming, etc.  Something needs to change."],"time":["2020-09-04 19:44:06"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["cronix"],"id":[24375388],"kids":{},"parent":[24371349],"text":["This will be a huge problem for people on the ground reporting on news events like protests&#x2F;riots.

Whenever I see a new company&#x27;s&#x2F;project&#x27;s runtime, I have come to expect a massively overcomplicated system that is &quot;built to scale&quot;. But ends up costing a lot and taking way too much time from product-development. A real issue with this is that when looking at the project&#x27;s feasibility to actually do scale, the runtime-cost will be estimated to a multiple of the current runtime cost which will appear larger than if the systems were built to handle the current load.<p>2. To me, this seems like a failure of cloud computing, which has a very compelling promise of letting you start with small servers, then easily switch up to bigger servers when needed. This was, in fact, hard before cloud.<p>3. The biggest issue I have with overspeced and overly complex deployments, is that to me it appears like (novice) developers is led to believe that they have to do the job in a complicated way. Look at a typical tutorial from the big and trend-setting players  how something should be deployed. The first hit on my favourite search engine for a &quot;Hashicorp Vault deployment&quot; [1] recommends using nine hosts. I know from experience that it runs fine on ONE host of the smallest kind I could find for our non-trivial use-case. Also, in that use-case it doesn&#x27;t matter that it is not HA, because it has turned out to be more stable than any of our other stuff, and can be restarted in a less than a minute.
