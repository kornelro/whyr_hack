That seems fairly evident, to be honest. I live in northern Europe where our salaries are quite good relative to other parts of the continent, but you can still find high quality engineers for &lt;$100k USD - many of whom are on par with FAANG developers being paid &gt;$200k in SFBA or Seattle and the like.

We stand on the shoulders of gian( code base)s, but ... at the same time the dysfunctionality seems to have increased, and not just in corporations, but also in smaller outfits. Just as efficiency paradox observed in the infamous &#x27;Bulshitt jobs&#x27; article, it is as if there are these ubiquitous hordes of &#x27;overhead&#x27; cadre hiding in the wings relentlessly trying to bootstrap themselves at the slightest opportunity.<p>I&#x27;ll give an anecdote, but it is fairly typical for many situations I encounter. This job was putting a daily webpage dashboard on some existing data and and integrating an existing service that delivers new data-points. There were very few uncertainties, It was scoped as a one week effort for a team of two self-managed senior engineers, with a second week of polish and iteration. This is not what happened. First a manager was appointed for the project, who&#x27;s first &#x27;hire&#x27; was another line manager to keep track of meetings and progress. He hired a business analyst to write a spec, soon joined by two other analysts to read the spec and write more spec. Then a &#x27;data scientist&#x27; consultant was brought on, who (rightly) ignored most of the gibberish in the analysis document but managed to instate a full enterprise cloud BI stack (hey, we&#x27;re dealing with data and need to draw a chart), and instead of just reading the data from the nightly reports decides to integrate directly with the data-warehouse, now upping the need for enterprise security etc. etc. 2 months into the project this is still going and the end result will still just be a chart on a webpage.<p>Second anecdote. This one in reverse, but putting light on the same principle. This concerns a large organization that for years was pondering to go digital with its mailing system (this org deals with thousands of pieces of physical mail coming in and thousands of paper pieces going out every day, often requiring multiple official approvals and signatures etc.). Thos was seen as a complex and large project, taking a year probably running into the multiple millions of euro). COVID-19 hits, and the organization is forced to go fully remote. A pragmatic team of 3,5 FTE is called in to &#x27;just make this work ASAP&#x27;, as the mail-flow is vital to the org. They finish the job in 3 (hectic) days. The solution has now been running for months.<p>So there is this &#x27;paradox of efficiency&#x27; in software as well. Software eats itself, but as it does it has the tendency to become morbidly obese (to stay within the metaphor)."],"time":["2020-05-25 09:48:46"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["29athrowaway"],"id":[23298779],"kids":{},"parent":[23297463],"text":["Website generators have been around since the 90s, but in 2020, people still work have full time jobs writing websites by hand."],"time":["2020-05-25 09:12:47"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Apocryphon"],"id":[23298279],"kids":[23299126,23299074],"parent":[23297463],"text":["A lot of people in the discussion disagree with the article&#x27;s first point about no-code&#x2F;less-code. While I do think the argument is a little fatalistic, the scoffing at the idea in the face of him bringing up evidence such as AWS and other IaaS&#x2F;PaaS reducing the number of in-house server engineers that companies need, and how the proliferation of open-source libraries&#x2F;frameworks has made creating software easier than ever, reminds me of economists pooh-poohing the notion that modern forms of automation will lead to unprecedented levels of job loss just because previous waves of automation didn&#x27;t. Even in the face of self-driving cars and automated receptionist&#x2F;call support agents that James Watt couldn&#x27;t even dream of.<p>But whether no-code&#x2F;less-code is inevitable, I think his first argument can still be substantiated from a different approach, at least in the near future: we&#x27;re coming at the end of a tech bubble, the money will start receding, and organizations have already been realizing they don&#x27;t need so many coders (and other staff) after all. Did Uber really need to build their own in-house version of Slack? Did Airbnb really need to pour so many resources towards adopting, even contributing heavily, to React Native, only to do an about-face and have to rewrite their mobile apps in their native platform? Did either company, like so many gig&#x2F;sharing companies during this bubble, have to invest so much in hyper-growth and expanding to so many markets before they were ready? Did so many of these companies have to fall prey to Not Invented Here syndrome and waste so much time in engineering boondoggles?<p>To some extent, yes, it&#x27;s what&#x27;s the investors wanted, or what corporate leadership thought would make the investors happy. And so this boom has led to massive hiring on a lot of busywork that doesn&#x27;t actually have tangible economic benefit to these organizations, and may have even led to worse outcomes due to unsustainable or reckless behavior.<p>Going back to the article, whether the first point can be explained by inevitable no-code&#x2F;low-code eating the world, or by the fact that a lot of software generated were due to the frenzy of a bubble, it still leads to the same point:<p>&gt; <i>Anyone who’s spent a few months at a sizable tech company can tell you that a lot of software seems to exist primarily because companies have hired people to write and maintain them.

I think this is a good analogy - but at my work it feels more like working from a huge, lively dinner table.  Sure - you can put on some noise cancelling headphones and ignore the conversation, but it will still be distracting, and worse, people will judge you for being antisocial.<p>Every once in a while, if you are lonely or your current task is sporadic and slow, it makes sense to bring your computer to the dinner table and casually work while being part of the party.  However, if this is your environment 40 hours a week, its highly taxing to productivity.  My only answer is to mute all Slack notifications or turn off Slack all together.  This works in the short term, but in the long term I bet it will be detrimental as I wont be seen as a &quot;helpful&quot; person that answers questions.  Ironically, I think it&#x27;s exactly those types of qualities that will help you to get promoted.  Our Slack rewards the developer that just &quot;hangs out&quot; and answers questions all day instead of getting meaningful work done.<p>That being said, I think the problem isn&#x27;t necessarily Slack, but large, poorly organized organization.  Personally, I am part of a dozen &quot;catch all&quot; Slack channels that put me into direct contact with over 100 people.  That might make sense for some jobs, but it&#x27;s absurd for a software developer.  My actual day to day work involves mainly working with a few developers and a manager or two.  My Slack should reflect that - it should literally just be a chat between these 5 people.<p>The rest of the organization should not be able to Slack me that easily, and instead only be able to contact me through a triage process.  If there is really a question from someone that I am best qualified to answer, then I am willing to answer it, but they should have to first determine that from other, more external facing people.  So I think the ultimate problem with Slack is that it makes it too easy for too many loosely related people to contact each other.

That channel has @here notifications disabled.<p>6) If you can, in your broader &quot;all the devs hang out here and can chat about work stuff&quot; or &quot;talk with ops here&quot; channels, consider adding group aliases, so you can say, in those channels @ops, or @team-ops to notify just that group when things are important.<p>7) Use @here sparingly, yourself. Use it only for extreme situations.<p>8) Give chatty bots their own channel. Having the pull request bot for your dev team in the same channel as active development is going on, or in the same channel as other teams are supposed to come in to talk to you about a project your team is working on is just not the best.<p>9) Current, unproven experiment: at my current job, my team is experimenting with a heavy use of threads. Previously, we had multiple projects occurring concurrently and historical knowledge on features is spread across the team with a lot of new members, so we can&#x27;t use the tricks of private channels per project to as much effect. Threads have a lot of weaknesses when it comes to readability and following; but, they do reduce the chances that someone&#x27;s important message will get lost in a swarm of other messages on more pressing issues.<p>edit: Whoops, thought of more.<p>10) Use snippets for any bit of code even slightly long. I&#x27;m thinking like 7 lines or more. There&#x27;s syntax highlighting, and they&#x27;re collapsible, saving precious screen real-estate<p>11) Use Posts for large format messages you want to post to a channel or multiple channels. They have formatting, headers, and so on. They&#x27;re also collapsible, again to save on screen real-estate.<p>12) Personal preference: try to not send multiple, short messages, unless that&#x27;s your company&#x27;s culture. It breaks up the conversation and makes it a bit hard to follow where a thread is, if you&#x27;re using threads. For example, which message do you put the response on? The part where the situation got confusing? A random message in the middle? The last one? The first one?<p>edit 2, 3: more adding (I&#x27;ll just add more after this and not say I&#x27;m adding more, if it happens again), and some removing some unnecessary information<p>13) Mute channels that you want to remain in, but don&#x27;t want to be bothered by (maybe unmute @here and @mentions on this channel). This could include your company&#x27;s random chatting channel, or the operations channel, or even your personal team&#x27;s channel if you&#x27;re currently heads down in a major project, but you might need to be pinged for something serious."],"time":["2020-05-25 19:28:07"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["GrumpyNl"],"id":[23298878],"kids":{},"parent":[23297113],"text":["I never understood slack and why it got so populair."],"time":["2020-05-25 09:32:23"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["princevegeta89"],"id":[23298441],"kids":{},"parent":[23297113],"text":["Slack sucks ass from a UX perspective."],"time":["2020-05-25 08:11:51"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["toyg"],"id":[23297962],"kids":[23298220,23299043,23298128,23298538,23299111,23299144],"parent":[23296617],"text":["The funny thing is that the MPAA are so clueless, they don’t even know popcorntime are their own worst enemies.

Or &#x27;Why would I switch from a flashy GUI webapp version of this particular feature?&#x27;<p>Emacs can&#x27;t be appreciated for any one feature, even org mode, powerful as that is. You have to take the entire system and all it&#x27;s possibilities into account. Org mode is particularly special because it integrates so many of Emacs&#x27; features, from literate programming to keeping a Wiki, to scheduling, to keeping a diary, to file browsing, to accounting, to emailing, to so much more. But to try to judge one package like org mode is a bit like judging a car by the quality of its seats.<p>The only thing I&#x27;ve experienced which compares to this is, perversely, the Office 365 suite. Yes, of course, all the functions are completely different and I&#x27;m not making a like-for-like functionality comparison. But in Office365 an email client (Outlook) is integrated with a team&#x27;s documents (via Sharepoint), chats (via Teams), calendar, etc, etc. The value of Office365 isn&#x27;t in any one app, it&#x27;s their integration. It&#x27;s the entire system.<p>Obviously the Emacs system has a completely different and opposing design philosophy to Office365&#x27;s. It&#x27;s ground-up, fully-extendable, initially demanding, text based, exportable, self-hosted, free, and so on. All of which increasingly goes against the grain of the trajectory of software today.

For example I could output a data table and then have another source block using GNU Plot to make a nice diagram.<p>(9) I can write explanations next to the source blocks in a lot of detail.<p>There is probably more, that does not come to mind just right now. Then there are some git hosts (notabug), which can render org-mode files like the usual hosts render markdown files (readme.md). So when you upload into git, you get instant readability in a rendered version, plus possibly syntax highlighting on the website.<p>That is only one aspect where org-mode really shines. I find it also indispensable for to-do lists. Using shortcuts to check or uncheck items and recalculating done&#x2F;to-do count or percentages in a higher level of the to-do list. One can prioritize headings and use tagging, to enable later filtering of headings and narrowing down visible content.<p>One can also render Latex formulas inline for preview. If you need only standard document classes, you can go ahead and output to latex. Or you can create your own document class in your init.el file and customize everything as you would in writing Latex yourself, only that you get the benefit of writing org-mode instead. Much more focus on the content.<p>And then of course everything is plain text, which makes this even better and easy to manage in version control.<p>I just love org-mode!

Second, a <i>search<\/i> tries to find concrete solutions. In general, a search is necessary because the constraints by themselves are not sufficient to deduce the unique solution as that would be computationally prohibitive.<p>You can therefore influence the speed of the logic program in two categorically distinct ways: First, you can post different constraints or try a different formulation altogether. Second, you can try different <i>search heuristics<\/i> that try to find concrete solutions more efficiently.<p>Regarding constraint propagation, there is a clear trade-off between <i>strength<\/i> and <i>efficiency<\/i> of propagation. For instance, the all_distinct&#x2F;1 constraint that is used in the sample solution propagates <i>very strongly<\/i>, and is therefore <i>much slower<\/i> than the <i>weaker<\/i> all_different&#x2F;1 constraint, even though they are completely equivalent from a semantic perspective: Both are true if and only if the given integers are pairwise distinct. It depends on the problem at hand whether the stronger propagation pays off, or whether the weaker propagation is in fact sufficient to quickly find solutions.<p>Especially for very simple tasks such as Sudoku, quick and weak propagation may well outperform strong and slow propagation.<p>In this concrete example, I easily achieved a 20-fold speedup by replacing the all_distinct&#x2F;1 constraint with all_different&#x2F;1, and using the <i>ff<\/i> labeling strategy to search for concrete solutions. <i>ff<\/i> means <i>first-fail<\/i>, and is often a very good strategy. To get this, I simply textually replaced all occurrences of all_distinct with all_different in the source code, and posted:<p><pre><code>    ?- problem(1, Rows),\n       sudoku(Rows),\n       append(Rows, Vs),\n       labeling([ff], Vs),\n       maplist(portray_clause, Rows).\n<\/code><\/pre>\nAlso, in less than 5 minutes, I just produced all 88 solutions for problem 3 which is shown at the end of the article. This is only due to using <i>less<\/i> powerful propagation, and a better search heuristic.<p>And this is one of the key attractions of constraint logic programming (CLP): You can relatively easily try different search strategies <i>while keeping the model the same<\/i>.<p>In Hakan&#x27;s very nice Picat solution, you see that a specific search heuristic is used, specified as:<p><pre><code>    solve([ffd,down], Vars).\n<\/code><\/pre>\nIn addition, Hakan&#x27;s program uses all_different&#x2F;1.

I don’t mean the cringe that you associate with western Tiktok content but for some reason majority of what the Indian kids were producing stood out as being beyond cringe to existing internet users (mainly Youtube &#x2F; Instagram userbase). I suspect this has to do with the millions of first-time internet &#x2F; smartphone users on Tiktok + the heavy influence of exaggerated emotional Bollywood drama now being done in 15 seconds on a smartphone.<p>Youtube on the other hand obviously had an existing audience that was used to consuming content of a certain level of quality &#x2F; production.

So the Youtube &#x2F; IG communities started making memes and calling out the cringe and bad content of Tiktok.<p>At some point one of the big influencers on Tiktok (Amir Siddiqui referred to in this article) provoked one of the biggest Indian Youtuber, Carryminati who is known for roasting people. Amir made a video saying Tiktok videos require talent, hard work, and a lot more dedication than Youtube videos and basically asked Carry to roast him.<p>Carry then took on the challenge and released an 8-minute roast video that beautifully called out all the cringe that tiktok users make, things that Amir had done in the past, etc. That Youtube roast video set several records within hours. The roast was actually so effective, it was hilarious to browse through Tiktok for the next few days as the entire Tiktok community sort of agreed and started making fun of each other and that single video actually shook the entire Tiktok community.<p>About 5-6 days later, Youtube took down the video (which was now the highest liked video of India by far) without explanation probably after receiving thousands of flags from tiktok users. It’s worth mentioning that the roast included comparisons of Amir to being a eunuch multiple times among other questionable insults because of his past tiktok videos. In my opinion, the video was definitely not trying to be Politically Correct but it wasn’t bad enough to be taken down.<p>Once the video was taken down, the Youtube and Instagram(meme pages) community started a campaign to leave a 1-star rating for Tiktok on the playstore and basically destroyed their rating which was about 4.5 when this started.<p>In case you’re wondering, I am an avid HN reader, an accomplished software engineer but I do spend about 5% of my free time enjoying Indian cringe. In fact I curate a big list of my favorites and share with my friends but very few people actually enjoy the cringe.<p>Was it worth explaining all of this to one of the most intellectually stimulating forums on the internet? Probably not. But I had to admit to myself that I know a lot more about this story than I’m proud to admit and that it would make me happy that it gets saved in the HN archive.<p>A copy of the original video that was taken down by Youtube - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=yoZ241zUgbA\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=yoZ241zUgbA<\/a><p>[1] - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ciYohWR2Pio\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ciYohWR2Pio<\/a>\n[2] - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Bg9gjmcHgE8\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Bg9gjmcHgE8<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-26 04:03:56"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["tw1912112"],"id":[23307015],"kids":{},"parent":[23305064],"text":["This is a really good case for network effects.

But, if you can use threat modelling to bring your developers into the fold of <i>why<\/i> they are developing a given feature and what makes it valuable, it makes better developers while ensuring they build security features into their work. The direction of this is business side inward, not technology outward as the author seems to recommend.<p>The threat model is the counter-case of your business model, that is, when a factor fails. Having developers absorb the latest in vulnerability research and threat intelligence is not useful when you can just tell them, &quot;I need you to make sure that a competitor&#x27;s sales engineer can&#x27;t pull this apart and humiliate us in a bake off,&quot; or, &quot;given we&#x27;re in payments, we&#x27;ve got both compliance hurdles and significant criminal threats.&quot;<p>There is more value in educating product owners and product  managers about how to identify and mitigate the counter-cases for their products&#x27; business models than externalizing risk by foisting it on developers who are neither equipped to handle it nor cognizant of it. In a product I developed, I defined threat scenarios as feature level Epics that developers use their skills to build for because people tend to know their own business needs and how it fails better than a corporate security group ever will.<p>Startups typically don&#x27;t need security outside of the bare minimum of compliance rituals because growth really does solve everything, see Zoom as an excellent example of this. I&#x27;m even having trouble recalling a startup that was killed by a security breach.<p>Security is a product level problem.

I don&#x27;t have anything resembling a precise definition of the problem, just rough impression. But IME, you start doing these threat scenarios in form [Actor] does [Action] to [Asset] and then [Consequences] happen, and you start noticing that:<p>- The sets of [Actor] and [Action] are fuzzy and nearly unbounded, and you have to shoehorn them into weird taxonomies to have something you can work with. And then you&#x27;re still left with lots of overlapping scenarios; it&#x27;s hard to make them independent in statistical sense, to be able to treat them as separate contributions to the risk calculation.<p>- Everything pivots around [Assets]. Not around [Consequences], because these are affected by a particular [Actor] and [Action]. I.e. it&#x27;s a different kind of PR disaster if your DB leaked because of a careless employee, vs. NSA tapping your internal data center links. But [Assets] are ultimately what attackers are after, and what costs you money if something happens to them.<p>So you end up with a huge list of scenarios like &quot;Russian hacktivists zero-day Windows machines and steal customer PII, leading to EU dropping a hammer&quot;, or &quot;Norwegian state-sponsored script kiddies SQL-inject company webpage and steal customer PII of North Americans, leading to bad press&quot;, etc., and you can see how the only thing you can reasonably enumerate here is what was damaged (stolen PII). It&#x27;s also the assets that motivate most attacks and that are the primary source of consequences (from outages to fines and bad press).<p>This leads me to the conclusion that it may be more productive to focus on what assets do you have, what can go wrong with any of them, and how much it would cost (without taking into account who the attacker was). You could go from there and expand into likely threat actors, but I&#x27;m not really convinced it&#x27;s productive. I didn&#x27;t try to verify it, but it might be more useful to just stick to assets and baseline losses, fortify any kind of access anyone has to these assets, and mostly ignore the various kinds of threat actors that might be involved. Instead of trying to distinguish between Russian hacktivists and Norwegian state-sponsored script kiddies, just lump it into &quot;attacker&quot;.<p>(I&#x27;ve seen scenario modelling going recursive on threat actors; you can distinguish between external and internal attackers, but then you can also distinguish between self-motivated and coerced internal attackers, etc. ad infinitum. You&#x27;ll likely never have the data to make anything resembling an informed estimate on probabilities here, and the deeper your taxonomy, the more the errors in guesstimates start to add up.

All of the interviewees spoke of their dogs as regularly involved in behaviors that were not understandable if one were only to see dogs merely as automatons responding to instinct or behavioral conditioning.&quot;<p>Anyway, I bring this up because that sentence stuck out to me as something that felt highly motivated, and in general it&#x27;s a feature I think you see sometimes in wiki articles - bold claims, almost vulgar in their simplicity, that just go ahead and declare a truth and don&#x27;t try to couch the language in terms of earned institutional understanding that fully merit the claim.

Peak flow in the throat of the pass is around 4 metres per second (13 ft&#x2F;s).[10]<p>&gt; Near to the pass are deep holes where strong vertical flows can occur.[11] In 2000, student divers taking part in a drift dive during the local ebb flow were separated from their surface float and caught in a whirlpool. This dragged them into &quot;Jacob&#x27;s Hole&quot;, a 68-metre (223 ft)[12] deep depression south west of the pass. The depth of this descent resulted in multiple fatalities. The group appears to have been drawn deep into the hole and then returned to the surface again. A dive computer record of one of the survivors show a depth of up to 89-metre (292 ft).

In my view, they bring almost nothing of value to the table.<p>Let&#x27;s talk a bit more about SONiC...<p>For one, SONiC literally lists that pull requests that aren&#x27;t already planned and approved will not be accepted[1]. This defeats a good chunk of the value of having a community project. People will want to contribute and extend your platform in ways you never thought of, and they&#x27;ll do it in a completely decentralized fashion.<p>Another issue I see is that SONiC literally holds back everything to an old Linux kernel and ships random BSP blobs that are unvetted. This is a nasty combination for anyone who wants to consider their NOS trusted or secure. They&#x27;re on a 4.9.x kernel, and while that is still maintained, it is far from the best option if you want to take advantage of innovation in Linux networking.<p>I&#x27;m also generally confused on why this whole project isn&#x27;t just &quot;let&#x27;s get the networking tools and hardware support stuff into standard Linux distributions and leverage their tooling and communities&quot;. This was also a problem I had with Cumulus. When I tore apart Cumulus, I figured out that it was less than a dozen unique tools and a distribution rebuilt for 32-bit MIPS and PowerPC. It was pretty trivial to rebase to standard Fedora or Debian and get a better platform out of it.<p>And finally, I don&#x27;t really think this provides any real innovation. It&#x27;s not really different from Cumulus, Open Network Linux, and others. And ONL actually is using more up to date kernels (5.4.x as of right now!) and offers better networking tools!<p>What I would <i>love<\/i> to see is all these people who keep doing this crap working in the actual Linux distribution communities to build and integrate with upstream projects so that everyone downstream gets all kinds of flexibility.<p>Imagine if you had a flavor of Fedora CoreOS for your network gear!

Certainly a small website with a mailing list is better setup on Squarespace, PaaS&#x2F;SaaS etc, but there are plenty of startup ideas that either rely on complete data control, users ability to manage their own apps, or a large infrastructure for hosting. A good example is indy game developers who release their game-servers as docker containers (see: Factorio, Minecraft, etc). The big players build out their own cloud, but that is a large barrier to entry. Plenty of game developers avoid multiplayer for exactly this reason. See Slack v Mattermost or Facebook v Mastadon for another example. Plenty of this bleeds between home-hosting and small business. Zoneminder, Mattermost, Wordpress - probably replaces a large bill for most companies, and keeps them 100% compliant with things like GDPR, etc.<p>If small businesses _did_ have a Kube cluster in their closets, and were able to decide the appropriate use of SaaS versus on-prem, and were able to carve up that compute securely to their customers, well it would enable a whole range of companies to compete with the big platforms. This is exactly what I&#x27;m building with my startup. When there is no real difference between hosted and self-hosted, besides the power and air conditioning, a huge new market for software opens, and the platforms that have (in my opinion) &quot;ruined&quot; the internet will have some real competition.

Computational photography is a really neat field. I&#x27;ve been slowly learning computer vision for a different project, but I must have a lot in common with the author of this post. Many late nights doing video conversion with the nvidia hardware decoders, photo registration with COLMAP, and fiddling with cameras.<p>I recently got a spherical camera and I am trying to use it for photogrammetry. I also have an array of four 4k cameras with hardware synchronized shutters hooked up to an NVIDIA Jetson Xavier[1]. That system can record four 4k streams at once to the SSD. I wonder how many 4k streams a Jetson Nano could record, because then you could use 16 of these [2] and four to eight Jetson Nanos to make a camera system with all hardware synchronized shutters that could easily record the data and export it via the network. It would cost around $2500 though. These projects get expensive and I keep thinking I want a sponsor, but the slow pace using what hardware I can buy is probably fine for now.<p>I&#x27;m trying to do a complete photorealistic photogrammetry capture of hiking trails, so I can run my robot in simulation on virtual hiking trails and train real computer vision networks. Lately I&#x27;ve been wondering if there is a GAN in my future...<p>The frustrating thing about my project is the sheer amount of computation required. I really don&#x27;t need a direct photogrammetry capture of a trail, an approximation would be fine to some degree. But I take like ten gigabytes of video data and then process each frame to find keypoints, run correlation on all these points, and all this (using COLMAP). This stuff can take days to process on my desktop.<p>Meanwhile there are neural networks that can compute depth from video in real time, and I wonder what it would take to stitch sequential depth estimations in to one 3D model with RGB textures in one continuous calculation. There&#x27;s so much research to do!<p>By the way I found the work in this paper pretty fascinating.

It was simply low tech (and the article is quite clear about this).  In addition, though “factory” today means manufacturing, in the early days of European empires, the “factory” was the warehouse where goods were stored and financed (factoring accounts receivable is still common today). The factories of the Bombay Presidency were the first effective toehold of British expansion into India.  Over time value add (labor&#x2F;processing) crept into those warehouses as the goods were already there, leading to today’s meaning.

Gold has no inherent value. I think Smith was wrong on the margin, but right on the bigger point. The gold did have value. Kings could use it to raise armies, for example. The Spanish monarchy was always trying to fill its war chest. But, gold didn&#x27;t fuel a trading cycle. Consumer goods &amp; industrial materials did.<p>Anyway... my point is that whatever happened in between leaving London ports and returning, they were returning with goods... not gold. They may have been trading gunpowder for slaves, to be sold in the colonies and exchanged for cotton. They may have traded for spices in India. When the ships returned, they returned with goods. Tea &amp; spices were luxury goods, that beneficiaries of the empire could enjoy. This is important, because it balanced consumption with revenue and created a cycle. Tea sippers had money because they owned shares. Revenue flowed to The Company from tea sipper. The Company used that revenue to keep bringing tea (also cotton &amp; indigo for the mills and other luxury goods like spices). The market was secured (to an extent) by rising share values.<p>When a spanish ship returned with gold, someone had gold, probably the king, probably for war.

On top of that, computes can (and do!) get systems into states that humans wouldn&#x27;t, so those skills may exceed the skills needed by manual operators. This is something that people who work on things like driver aids talk about a lot, but I don&#x27;t see as much attention to in the systems observability field.<p>&gt; One can therefore only expect the operator to monitor the computer&#x27;s decisions at some meta-level, to decide whether the computer&#x27;s decisions are &#x27;acceptable&#x27;, If the computer is being used to make the decisions because human judgement and intuitive reasoning are not adequate in this context, then which of the decisions is to be accepted ?

One of the things that struck me is that people who investigate UFOs are their own worst enemies. Often, while watching documentaries, people will say &quot;I&#x27;ve never believed in UFOs until I saw one&quot;. For the longest time statements like that really confused me. How could you not believe that people sometimes see things that they can&#x27;t identify? Then I realized that to most people UFO means alien spacecraft. UFO people have pushed the &quot;I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s aliens, but it&#x27;s totally aliens&quot; narrative to the point that the entire field is tainted.<p>As the article mentions, it seems like the idea of aliens visiting the Earth has become almost some sort of religion. The other thing is that actual science isn&#x27;t very sexy. I&#x27;m reminded of the Hessdalen lights, unidentified aerial lights that have been appearing over a valley in northern Norway for several decades. There&#x27;s a monitoring station there with all sorts of instruments, but there still isn&#x27;t a definitive explanation for the lights. &quot;These are alien spaceships&quot; is definitely a much more thrilling explanation than &quot;we have several possible explanations, mostly involving some sort of plasma in the atmosphere&quot;.<p>One of the documentaries I was watching was by the History channel and it was really bad. They didn&#x27;t even attempt to present prosaic explanations and took everything at face value. One episode even talked about native Americans being descended from aliens and being able to summon UFOs. I know the History channel is complete trash, but this series was apparently done in collaboration with MUFON.<p>The entire thing has been tainted so completely that it can actually interfere with real science. The study of upper atmospheric light was likely held back for years because pilots who saw it were afraid to mention that they saw lights in the sky.<p>These things are almost certainly worthy of study, but the entire field of interest needs to be completely cleansed of the woo and pseudoscience that plagues it."],"time":["2020-09-12 20:41:52"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Insanity"],"id":[24453667],"kids":[24454621,24454132,24456185],"parent":[24451502],"text":["Lex Fridman recently had David Fravor on his podcast and they spoke about this: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=aB8zcAttP1E\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=aB8zcAttP1E<\/a>"],"time":["2020-09-12 18:43:59"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Animats"],"id":[24454336],"kids":[24454418,24455389],"parent":[24451502],"text":["Mandatory XKCD: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;1235&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;1235&#x2F;<\/a><p>If only there was a network of automatic telescopes watching the sky 24&#x2F;7.<p>Oh, there is.[1] GEODSS, with pairs of automated telescopes, picks up satellites, larger space junk, and incoming missiles and asteroids.

He&#x27;s tightly lipped about what&#x27;s in them, but he&#x27;s an expert on the matter.  He and his team built and launched a solid state gallium ion drive into space and demonstrated their orbital correction capabilities.  Over the years he tested several prototypes of both the EmDrive and the Mach Effect thrusters and dismissed them in various iterations of his thrust measurement experiments, the latest published works describing the observed miniscule effects as thermal vibrations and interactions of the Earth&#x27;s magnetic fields with power lines in the test chamber.  But they were inconclusive.<p>This time around, Tajmar built a magnetic shielding chamber meant to exclude those effects.  One paper is for analysis of the conventionally microwave-described EmDrive, and other one is for its laser version.  Mark your calendar and the papers might put a nail in parts of this coffin.<p>The publication date is somewhat telling.  The papers were meant to be released in the Space Propulsion 2020 conference this month but due to Covid-19 they were delayed until March.  It&#x27;s a stretch that a significant scientific breakthrough would be delayed, but, on the other hand he is a German.<p>Tajmar himself wasn&#x27;t hopeful prior to the latest measurement experiment: &quot;This is such an extraordinary claim that you must, as Carl Sagan said, have extraordinary proofs. You must be really super sure on that.

Of course, I don&#x27;t think they are alien spacecrafts, and alternative explanations, such as unidentified natural phenomena are more likely. However, there are two problems regarding to UFOs. The first problem is, it&#x27;s not a single phenomenon, but a class of different phenomena, potentially hundreds of different things. The next problem is, their appearances are entirely unpredictable, you cannot just wait at a place and keep observing it with a rack of instrumentation. These two problems mean that UFO will continue to be an open question for many decades, if not forever, and most researches will not recognize them as an genuinely unknown physical phenomena.<p>Consider Ball Lightning [0]. It&#x27;s real, and there are 200 years of anecdotal reports from everywhere in the world. Yet, until recently, it was not recognized as a real phenomenon by many researchers in the scientific communities - for good reason, &quot;I never saw one in my life, and why should I believe these random stories on ball lightning, if there&#x27;s no irrefutable data recorded by a scientific instrument?&quot; But because of its unpredictable nature, it&#x27;s highly unlikely to carry a scientific observation to begin with. It was only scientifically observed in 2014, for a duration of only 1.6 seconds [1], by a coincidence. If arguing for the existence of ball lightning is that difficult, now imagine the case of UFO.<p>I believe a lot of data can be potentially gathered on UFO - acoustic, optical, radar, or X-ray measurements are all possibilities. However, because of the not-a-single-phenomenon and unpredictable nature of UFOs, such scientific investigations will never be funded. And even if there are funded, such projects will be a wild-goose chase on unpredictable UFOs, and such UFOs will disappear before you are ready to do some observations on them. It&#x27;s unlikely to find anything significant. And don&#x27;t even mention that UFO&#x27;s popular connotation of aliens alone is enough to discredit the potential scientific efforts of investigations.<p>On the other hand, hypothetically, imagine that UFOs could always appear at a specific geographical locations in a predictable manner, only then the members of academia will start treating it seriously and real researches will be funded. But it&#x27;s not going to happen.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ball_lightning\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ball_lightning<\/a><p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newscientist.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;dn24886-natural-ball-lightning-probed-for-the-first-time&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newscientist.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;dn24886-natural-ball-li...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-09-12 21:54:29"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["shadowprofile77"],"id":[24458649],"kids":{},"parent":[24451502],"text":["First of all, it&#x27;s important to distinguish very clearly between UFOs and &quot;aliens from another world visiting us&quot;. The two are not at all necessarily related and the public discourse, especially in mass media, UFOlogy dogma and literature, only weakens arguments because of this forced connection based on tenuous leaps of logic.<p>By definition, any unidentified object in the sky is a UFO unless it&#x27;s clearly identified, as many here have already mentioned. Thus, for one thing, many UFOs can simply be this: things that may or may not be natural but which have some rational explanation and have not been clearly labeled as such.<p>However, and more importantly I think, is the possibility that even a genuinely inexplicable UFO event (such as the 1978 nuclear storage events linked to in another comment here [1], the 2004 Nimitz UFO incidents and the 2014 and 2015 events among others) may not be the classical aliens in the sky concept that gets pushed despite little substance, though it might indeed be a case of unknown objects moving around human installations with a certain frequency. The latter is a highly documented, definitively observed phenomena, the former is very shaky assumption and absolutely nothing more. Evidence of unknown objects moving in seemingly incredible ways abounds. There is no evidence at all of those objects being ships from another world in the galaxy or Universe.<p>What this boils down to is that UFOs as a genuinely, currently inexplicable phenomena could very well be completely real. They might even be corporeal expressions of an intelligent nature. This however doesn&#x27;t have to mean that they came from space or from aliens in any classical sense. They could have come from a completely unknown source that doesn&#x27;t get nearly as much attention as the UFOs = aliens supposition. Certain authors have covered this with their own speculations and arguments, such as Jacques Vallee, Micheal Persinger, and even others with more sensationalist arguments like John Keel. None of them are necessarily less likely to be wrong than those who argue that we&#x27;re dealing with aliens, and at least some of these arguments seem more plausible than the dogmatic skeptic stance of completely disregarding all sightings as anything except humans being confused by normal, known phenomena.<p>An important sub-point to the previous paragraph is that the government might seem to be playing stupid not because of some giant coverup of secret knowledge or much less clandestine contact with extraterrestrials, but the (to me) much more likely possibility of a general attempt to cover up that they also have no clue what&#x27;s going on whenever they come across cases that none of their resources let them explain. It&#x27;s possible that (as is common with any kind of organizational thinking) they detest looking stupid and prefer looking ambiguous to admitting ignorance of something completely outside their ability to control or monitor clearly.<p>1. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thedrive.com&#x2F;the-war-zone&#x2F;31798&#x2F;the-secretive-inventor-of-the-navys-bizarre-ufo-patents-finally-talks\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thedrive.com&#x2F;the-war-zone&#x2F;31798&#x2F;the-secretive-in...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-09-13 07:38:04"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mgraczyk"],"id":[24455453],"kids":[24455489],"parent":[24453825],"text":["Not sure what is intended, but it seems to have some bugs?<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;assets.opentoken.com&#x2F;sha256&#x2F;N1ShZ7kcVmH_-auZEGaGOS_baJxgQTG2\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;assets.opentoken.com&#x2F;sha256&#x2F;N1ShZ7kcVmH_-auZEGaGOS_b...<\/a><p>Ah nevermind, it&#x27;s matching the curve against template fields so it makes sense that it would show the best match even when the match is poor."],"time":["2020-09-12 22:40:25"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["rg2004"],"id":[24454636],"kids":{},"parent":[24453825],"text":["I created a method similar to this one for curve extrapolation based on sample curves.
