Trading desk, pilot or surgeon springs to mind.<p>Also if a company requires you to do 60 hours of coding instead of 40 and it&#x27;s just JIRA tasks adding feature X Y Z then those extra 20 hours don&#x27;t help your career at all, but if you did a 40 hour job and spent 10 hours learning carefully selected skills in your spare time that would help your career a lot over time."],"time":["2020-05-18 03:45:15"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["rootusrootus"],"id":[23217568],"kids":[23221038,23217696],"parent":[23217221],"text":["Not for me.

I have often seen that employees who have children are afforded more flexibility, shorter hours, and less work than those who do not have children. While I understand these are necessary if you have children, a disproportionate amount of work and higher expectations are given to those without children in my office. For example, if you have a child, that is a perfectly acceptable reason to work from home, but simply wanting to work remotely is not accepted. Do I need to have a child to work from home (especially because I can&#x27;t have children...lol)? Anyway, this is obviously not a universal experience across companies (and trust me I&#x27;m happy that parents have these perks at my company), but I do find it frustrating when someone is expected to stay at the office until midnight because &quot;what else would they do&quot; if they don&#x27;t have children lol.

When I got older I began to question the concept of the career, ironically when I finally started ‘winning’ at it.<p>1. Ratings and promotions within a job&#x2F;company are boss personality and politically dependent and typically very unfair. Lots of hard work goes unrewarded.<p>2. Even if you do get lucky and get a promotion, your prize is 5-10% salary bump (maybe) and more work, stress and meetings (I don’t much enjoy meetings myself). Look closely at most big company executives and think if you really want the job for more than the social prestige&#x2F;ego. They travel a ton and are always in meetings, it gets old.<p>3. So if the executive jobs are undesirable, then climb the ladder for money? It takes allot of money to make a difference, I.e you need $500k in the bank to ek out approx $1500 a month in cash flow at 4%. If you making $100k annually or $150k annually, $200k, or even $250 its still going to take over a decade to save a decent amount of money. The 5-10% salary bump doesn’t make much difference.<p>So why a career? There are likely more efficient ways to make money if that’s your goal. Starting a business, blogging, consulting, etc may have more risk but the ceiling is uncapped unlike  a ‘career’. \nSo why sacrifice something wonderful like time with your child? Money? Ego? You want a great LinkedIn profile one day?

Lots of time.  So if you believe that more time at a work is better, and that it&#x27;s a zero-sum game (i.e., time with children will take away from time at work), then yes, having children will be bad for your career.<p>But there&#x27;s a ton wrong with that thinking.<p>First: Exercise takes time away from work. Vacations take time away from work. Sleeping takes time away from work. And yet, even the most die-hard workers realize that they have to exercise, take vacations, and sleep. And that doing so makes them better people, healthier and more well-adjusted.  And even better able to do their jobs.<p>I can&#x27;t speak for everyone, but I&#x27;ve found that my children -- now 19, 17, and 14 -- have not been distractions from work, but complements to it. They have helped me to find insights, to understand myself and the world, and to generally be a better person.<p>Second: It&#x27;s possible to make lots of money and have a great career with children. It&#x27;s also possible to do so without children. So it&#x27;s not an either&#x2F;or situation. Yes, you&#x27;ll have to prioritize. Yes, you&#x27;ll be frustrated sometimes that you can&#x27;t finish a work project because the kids need you. But it also gives you some perspective, understanding that even if your project is delayed by a day, that&#x27;s OK.<p>Third: There&#x27;s no doubt that children can be maddening, frustrating, and time consuming. Especially when they&#x27;re young, they demand lots of attention. But in my case, all of that frustration was easily counterbalanced by the joy, excitement, and fulfillment that comes from having children, speaking with them, and learning from them.<p>Finally: If your job means that you have to dedicate yourself to it, to the exclusion of everything else, is that really a job you want?  If your company doesn&#x27;t encourage you to take time with your family, or for yourself, what sorts of people are working there, and do you really want to be working there?<p>I don&#x27;t know if I would be a <i>worse<\/i> consultant, trainer, and developer without my children.

Some comment threads incite violence against Jews, others violence against Muslims, and then there&#x27;s the white supremacists inciting violence against everybody.<p>Putting comments trolling any Chinese viewers below anything that covers China is something that&#x27;s taken off lately, either because of racism or because of increased activism in Hong Kong.<p>Having everybody be free to say anything had led the YouTube comments to be generally regarded as a place or toxicity and horror for many people. YouTube trying to brush up their image after Elsagate and other such PR disasters only makes sense, and their comment section is the first I&#x27;d personally clean up. I don&#x27;t know how you&#x27;d do that without dancing on the dangerous line between (American) expectations of complete freedom of speech and getting out the nutjobs, but someone over at Google seems to be trying to and probably uses this new-fangled machine learning thing to do it because it doesn&#x27;t involve paying people to keep the stream of verbal manure in check.<p>There&#x27;s also the danger to your platform that comes with  angering Chinese nationalists. When Notepad++ added a message to stand up to the Chinese concentration camps, its Github got completely flooded by angry Chinese people and trolls from both sides. Some of the people calling the author &quot;filthy dog&quot; and other expletives were maintainers of seemingly commonly-used libraries and projects. Criticising the worst of China seems to have the same effect as posting a video of a burning American flag. I doubt many platform owners would like their platform to host these social garbage fires.<p>All of that culminates into topics where trolling often occurs being removed or shadow banned. Posts on HN get shadowbanned as well, usually after manual flagging, but I do have doubts about the absence of troll farms controlling the narrative here.<p>As far as I know, YouTube has always had certain words being blacklisted, usually swears and such. This system can also be used by channel owners to maintain their comment section. I can only imagine when Google decided to add material criticising China, but I&#x27;d expect it would have started when the first Hong Kong protests were met with violence."],"time":["2020-05-18 15:08:54"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["thrlllllll"],"id":[23221501],"kids":[23225375,23221532],"parent":[23221264],"text":["Can confirm works on my own videos, even if they are unlisted.

I looked at old Opterons, but ultimately went with Xeons (4x E7-4880v2) because of HyperThreading, even though they were a bit more expensive (I think I paid $90 per CPU).  I was super excited that I could build a 60 core&#x2F;120 thread computer with 12 TB of disk space and 512 GB of ECC RAM for under $2k.<p>That excitement lasted until I actually got the parts and built it.  Heavy iron like this should not live in your spare bedroom.  The 4U server chassis weighed about 150 lbs fully built, and it made over 95 dB of noise.  The noise was so bad I couldn&#x27;t leave it on overnight, and only powered it up to run code for a few hours at a time.<p>But in the long run, it scored 81k on GeekBench 4, which was over 3x more than my gaming PC, and having 512 GB RAM meant my simulations never needed swap, so they ran several days faster even though the memory was only DDR3.  It was a fun experiment, but don&#x27;t buy an old Opteron CPU unless you have experience with servers and know what you&#x27;re getting into.  It doesn&#x27;t make sense for businesses to build a system with old parts, and a lot of homelab hobbyists are going to be disappointed if they think they can build something suitable for home use.<p>Also: If you&#x27;re wondering why I didn&#x27;t use AWS or other cloud compute, it&#x27;s because the costs of running a 32 core instance (which was about the same speed as my 60 older cores) would have been over $10k with my usage pattern- $30&#x2F;hour for a few hours each day for a couple years really puts a dent in your wallet."],"time":["2020-05-18 15:37:05"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["DisjointedHunt"],"id":[23219911],"kids":[23220599],"parent":[23219702],"text":["This is probably not the most appropriate comparison to make.

Let me summarize the claims:<p>1. The developers had a couple of bugs that cause non-deterministic outputs in weird settings. It&#x27;s a randomized model so this isn&#x27;t a disaster, but obviously it would be better to have all non-determinism derived from a single seed. However, none of the bugs point to scientific issues. Still, these are real bugs that should be fixed. And indeed: another team pointed out some issues, they triaged the report, and it appears that they&#x27;ve been fixing these issues.<p>2. The code doesn&#x27;t run well multi-threaded, and so the scientists run it on a single core. This seems like a feature the developers have de-prioritized. The critics make a HUGE deal about how using a single core is inefficient, but at the end of the day: if scientists can get simulations done in a reasonable time using a single core, this seems like a valid prioritization of limited development effort. The critics know better, obviously.<p>3. There aren&#x27;t a bunch of unit tests. But as the authors point out code is in development and being altered continuously to reflect new developments in society and new knowledge about the virus, so it seems hard to develop unit tests that won&#x27;t become broken as the underlying components change.<p>4. The critics seem to have a strong grounding in epidemiology. I&#x27;m just kidding, they claim to be pure software engineers, but still insist on spending a significant fraction of their critique disputing the calculation of R0 and lecturing the epidemiologists on how they think it should be calculated. This is a giant red flag given that the critics&#x27; sole stated expertise is software engineering.<p>5. The developers are continuing to add features to simulate new aspects of the ongoing pandemic (e.g., new code to simulate the impact of contact tracing apps) instead of fixing every minor issue in the code. Given that we&#x27;re in the midst of a deadly epidemic that is putting human beings into the ground, this seems like a completely unavoidable resource allocation decision to me.<p>6. The critics can&#x27;t even be bothered to pretend their criticism is objective. E.g., the piece concludes with &quot;on a personal level, I’d go further and suggest that all academic epidemiology be defunded.&quot; Yeah, sure, you&#x27;re a totally disinterested software expert here.<p>I guarantee you if you look at any piece of software -- commercial or scientific, no matter the budget -- with the politically-motivated goal of tearing apart the author, you will succeed. I can say this having spent years doing security and expert witness code reviews for some of the biggest and smallest companies in the software industry.

And I feel like this plays into a negative trend I&#x27;m seeing.<p>The retail brokerage market right now is treading on similar &#x27;mistakes&#x27; in institutional markets 15ish years ago. Proprietary APIs were prolific, and therefore increased switching costs and lock-in (looking at you, Reuters and Bloomberg).<p>On the one hand, retail brokers need to support popular programming languages and paradigms to gain traction. So, they are releasing http-based APIs, or popular language-specific libraries&#x2F;bindings for their proprietary APIs. But, they are doing this instead of pushing well-publicised battle-tested standards such as FIX[1], that would normalise the playing field across brokers. So my gut feel is that they are banking on users coding against their APIs and having some lock-in effects. Notable exception is that any broker that supports cTrader will have a FIX API, because cTrader provides that for them.<p>The problem is: if I write a bunch of code to work against Alpaca, TD Ameritrade, or whoever, that code will likely need to be revisited for some other broker like Robinhood. Granted, market connectivity code _should_ be well abstracted from my model if I&#x27;m following good design principles.

For inspiration, simply look at what hasn&#x27;t already become web based. Some things I thought of:<p>1. Heavy lifting - As others have mentioned, running some code in a browser is quite a few times slower than locally. As Moore&#x27;s Law comes to a screaming halt we&#x27;re going to be need to get better at creating efficient software rather than relying on the underlying hardware to get faster.<p>2. Capability - Some things are inherently difficult to do in the browser, such as custom networking, calling kernel functions, accessing various hardware, etc, etc. You can always have your native app launch a web-based front-end, but going back the other way is not possible by design.<p>3. Hardware Access - Sometimes you need to access a camera, USB device, GPIO, I2C, SPI, run architecture specific instructions on the CPU, access the GPU, etc, etc. Again, the browser typically won&#x27;t let you access these by default.<p>4. Security - This comes in a few parts: (a) You&#x27;re able to bypass &quot;most&quot; security and do what you want within reason. As long as the user ran your application you usually have the same privileges. (b) Now that you&#x27;re dug-in you can enforce a level of security that may not easily be available otherwise. (c) Features such as app signing mean that the user can more easily guarantee the app came from you, rather than relying on their ability to read the exact URL in some email at 2am. If I run `apt-get install &lt;X&gt;` or equivalent in other OSes there is a chain of accountability.<p>5. Memory - Put simply the browser adds massive overhead to any application and typically has inefficient data structures. Compare something like Atom [1] to any equivalent native editor for example.

A simple example is a video editor (such as, the one I&#x27;m developing, but that&#x27;s besides the point). Sure, you can have a video editor as a JS app, but that will be incredibly trivial compared to a desktop app.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that you can&#x27;t match any desktop feature on to web. I&#x27;m saying that some will take 10x+ time and resources (and thus, an insanely higher complexity) than desktop. And some features, they are simply not feasible to do on the web. Let me give you an example: time-remapping for a video editor (one thing that I&#x27;m gonna implement soon). This is such a complex issue, requiring advanced caching + lots of RAM + fast rendering, that implementing it in a browser is simply unfeasible TODAY.<p>As things become feasible on the web, lots of them begin by being 10x+ more complex than desktop (this gets lower in complexity in time), for one thing.

When running your app inside a browser, many key combos are reserved by the OS (and they differ by OS), and many are reserved by the Browser (and they differ by browser). As a result, your app has to avoid a huge number of key combos, because some OS or browser uses those.<p>2) Latency. It&#x27;s not impossible to make a fast web app, but you&#x27;re already at a disadvantage, due to the inherent overhead of the browser and JS runtime. Put it this way: making a user experience that feels slow and sluggish in a native app requires a lot more mistakes than doing the same thing in a webapp.<p>3) Filesystem support. It&#x27;s just better with native. Especially on Windows where you can fully customize the file-open dialog box with app-specific business rules and warnings.<p>4) Hardware. You&#x27;ll always be at the mercy of the underlying browser&#x27;s support for hardware. Need to allow the user to switch between sound devices? This is easy with a native app, but it may require going to the browser control panel if you&#x27;re a webapp.<p>5) Leaky abstractions. As a user, I want to open an app and do everything inside of that app. When using a webapp, I may have to fiddle with browser settings, key combos may break me out of the immersion as I accidentally open some browser toolbar or help feature, and the browser toolbars and window is always there to distract me.<p>6) Updates. With a desktop app, it can show me an alert when it&#x27;s time to update, and I can choose to update now, or do so later. With a webapp, the updates are normally locked to a browser refresh (I need to refresh the page to get the update, and the update will happen whether I want it or not once I reload). Sometimes, the app decides it&#x27;s time to update and just force-reloads itself (in the case of an app window I&#x27;ve left open for too long - days or so, while working on something important)."],"time":["2020-05-18 03:56:36"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ComputerGuru"],"id":[23214290],"kids":[23214333],"parent":[23211851],"text":["See, everyone likes to complain about electron but when I did a market study asking “would you pay for a full-featured native Slack app that was lightweight and designed with functionality in mind” the answer I got was mainly “yeah but no.” As best as I can figure, it was mainly feeling they were entitled to it for free as it’s what Slack <i>should<\/i> have developed, so they were not about to pay to correct a mistake they’re “not responsible for” never mind that they’re the ones paying the price for it.<p>(I wrote a fully native iMessage client for Windows 10 [0] and enjoyed it enough to consider building a product around the code, minus the iMessage component.)<p>[0]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;neosmart.net&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2018&#x2F;imessage-for-windows&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;neosmart.net&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2018&#x2F;imessage-for-windows&#x2F;<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-17 20:53:27"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ahmedbaracat"],"id":[23215791],"kids":[23215914],"parent":[23211851],"text":["I am constantly annoyed by the web apps, not only because they consume so much resources, but because of the noticeable UI lag that drives me crazy.

Cross-platform could be done with REBOL, REALBasic (aka Xojo), Runtime Revolution (aka LiveCode) and many other languages. Users didn&#x27;t expected fancy flat animated user interfaces made of 100% custom controls, people were fine with normal native standard stuff as long as the app worked.<p>Now, there is no easy way to build cross-platform apps that is easier than electron. Languages like modern C++ and Rust are extremely powerful but they require more experienced developer to be used effectively. GUI toolkits like Qt and wx, are good but a ton of UX professionals now are trained to ship UIs in tools like figma, skewing all the native controls and creating beautiful masterpieces that are easier to do with HTML&#x2F;CSS than implement with a native toolkit.<p>Native apps got harder to do not because we don&#x27;t have access to the tech we had, but because of added friction. It is like death by a thousand paper cuts. You make the professionals designing the UX&#x2F;UI create interfaces that are harder to reproduce with native technology, then you select a GUI toolkit such as Qt&#x2F;wx and try to reimplement that using whatever language is best. It takes longer than developing an electron app, requires more expensive developers. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it will be a better product, but it will take longer, be more expensive, and will need to be done with more care. And after the app is done, there is the need to deal with all the sandboxes and crazy stuff that Apple requires these days if you&#x27;re shipping a native mac app. Many electron apps sidestep a lot of this by simply being thin clients for some SaaS company and doing the hard stuff on a server (which also opens an opportunity for mining the data for our capitalists overlords).<p>The barrier for entry for developing an electron app is so low. JS is an easy language to start. There are so many ready made UI kits. You can have a small app running before a new developer can understand how the new pointer stuff work on modern C++.<p>All that text is to say that I think we need easier languages and toolkits that target native experiences. Something like Lazarus, LiveCode, are all steps in the right direction for me."],"time":["2020-05-18 10:23:17"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["me551ah"],"id":[23215842],"kids":{},"parent":[23211851],"text":["The whole idea of web first has actually made things worse. Let&#x27;s compare web apps to native desktop apps, shall we?<p>Memory Usage<p>A few years ago while trying to figure out why I was running out of RAM, I stumbled upon chrome’s task manager. Gmail was using up 700MB of RAM and all I had open was the Inbox. No fancy search box or Compose, the Inbox was taking up 700MB of RAM to display lines of text in a Tabular format. I’ve been a heavy user of Email clients and if you pick any of the native clients (Thunderbird, Outlook, Apple Mail) and open a bunch of searches and compose windows the memory usage will still stay below 100MB.<p>I used mIRC a few decades ago to connect to multiple chat servers, run my own bots, serve files over DCC and run scripts all while staying under 20MB of Ram. These days to send a text message over Slack I need over 1GB of RAM. Even basic apps with all of their trackers, external javascript scripts and doms take up 100s of MBs in memory. And the most common solution to running out of memory is to close chrome windows.<p>Battery&#x2F;CPU Usage<p>DOM is slow. Updating layout and repainting is even slow. Javascript being a dynamic language is slow. Web apps are anything but simple these days and since they have to work under the limitations of all the slow components, the CPU ends up making up for it. Chrome is almost always present in my Macbook’s ‘Using significant energy’ tab. On the other hand, I rarely if ever see native apps in the battery bar unless I’m doing something which should actually consume a lot of CPU cycles like running multiple synths in Ableton or Compiling.\nWhen apps are built for mobile, battery usage is a major area to optimize on. But nobody even gives it a thought for web apps<p>60 FPS<p>Mobile apps run on 60fps, Native desktop apps run at 60fps, Games run ( or at least are designed to) run at 60fps. Instagram on chrome starts at 2-3 fps and usually hovers around 30fps. My laptop which is supposed to be more powerful than my mobile phone is only able to churn out half the frame rate even though they are both running at the same resolution! Web apps are not buttery smooth and can be jerky at times. Sure somebody can work really hard and optimize a website to run at 60fps at all times, but it needs a lot of effort. Mobile apps run at 60fps out of the box without much effort. \nMobile and native apps use the GPU a lot more efficiently. Since they have a lot more information about which controls are being used, they can recycle items a lot better and do a much better job at hardware acceleration via the GPU. Not to mention that you have access to raw graphics APIs in case you want to push UI performance even further.<p>Development Environment\nYou can build desktop apps in a plethora of languages and even for mobile apps you have many cross-platform frameworks. But building for the web(and electron) forces you to HTML&#x2F;Javascript(and derivates). Javascript is a dynamic prototypical language that was not designed for the scale of apps that are being built in it today. It has no type safety, memory leaks are common and it’s slow due to its dynamic nature. While there have been many efforts to improve performance like V8s JIT, it still lags behind a lot of major languages. WASM seems promising, but it’s still has a long way to go. \nAnd it’s laughable how weak the browser platform itself is. SQLite is available on raspberry pi, embeddable systems, mobile platforms and just about every other platform on the planet. You can store data, run complex relational queries and do more with so less. But it is not available on the most widely used platform on the planet, the browser.<p>With the rise of electron apps, big and bulky web apps have started making their way onto the Desktop. There are some who are even trying to get the same apps on mobile via PWAs. While the web has the advantage of easy accessibility, IMO we have sacrificed too much in terms of user experience for that one convenience. If you built an app with the same UI and functionality in a native language and as a web app, the native app will run circles around it."],"time":["2020-05-17 23:53:21"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["signaru"],"id":[23214529],"kids":[23214613,23214559,23215095],"parent":[23211851],"text":["Modern browsers these days are powerful things... just a curiousity, are there non native browsers?"],"time":["2020-05-17 21:19:11"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["kokizzu"],"id":[23215407],"kids":[23223339],"parent":[23211851],"text":["this just like asking:\ndo you prefer to use native&#x2F;high performance applications? yes\ndo you like developing native application? no \nif the performance and memory usage of web app already equal to native desktop app, which do you prefer to use? web<p>XD"],"time":["2020-05-17 22:56:16"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["tuananh"],"id":[23216932],"kids":{},"parent":[23211851],"text":["always prefer native desktop apps if there&#x27;s choice."],"time":["2020-05-18 02:34:56"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[23214778],"kids":{},"parent":[23211851],"text":{},"time":["2020-05-17 21:48:38"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":["freepor"],"id":[23212317],"kids":{},"parent":[23211851],"text":["You need a desktop app when 1) you’re spending a ton of time in the app or 2) you need every ounce of performance and feature set that you can obtain and 3) you’re willing to pay for it.<p>If you’re not building something like this, don’t build for desktop."],"time":["2020-05-17 16:39:07"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["blargmaster33"],"id":[23214754],"kids":{},"parent":[23211851],"text":["Every time I work on our WPF app at work I get reminded what a fucking joke HTML&#x2F;CSS&#x2F;JS is.

I also happen to think that&#x27;s a good thing.<p>The issue is that developing for a particular OS is, generally, more difficult than developing for the web. The app delivery mechanism is also more convoluted (for native apps) than simply entering a web address in the browser. The web also seems to have more ubiquitous standards that abstract away the differences between OSs - you can, with a high degree of certainty, ensure that your app is usable by 99% of computer users, given the <i>current<\/i> software they have on their device - with native apps, there is no such guarantee, especially if you&#x27;re relying on shared libraries.<p>Browsers are also becoming more feature rich. This has had a negative impact on their memory consumption, but given it&#x27;s 2020, some may retort &quot;memory is cheap&quot;. And while some browsers (Chrome, looking especially at you) do a very poor job of memory management, I believe the competitive nature of the browser market will force a reawakening soon, where a lot of the inefficiencies in memory management will have to be eradicated (or vendors risk losing market share). Think back to 2014&#x2F;15 when Node.js was really becoming established - the PHP team suddenly felt a need to re-optimise their engine for PHP7 (and with dramatic results)... Point is, only after ~20 years at the top did something spur PHP&#x27;s team on enough to do something about their inefficiencies.<p>Finally, I can see a future where the line between web and native apps is even more blurred. WebAssembly is the first step, however things could get even more elaborate. Perhaps we could end up with the ability to start docker-like containers from within web apps (given the right permissions, of course) to spin up servers for audio&#x2F;video&#x2F;image processing on the client itself, and interact with them via a web page. If we get to this point, native apps would feel even more obsolete.<p>I know your question was only about the current state, but I felt the need to talk about the future to highlight the marked difference in the rate of innovation in the web ecosystem (fast) vs the native ecosystem (slower). It would not surprise me if the web ecosystem ends up winning in the end. If I was building an app today, and it only requires features I can deliver via the browser, I would almost certainly go the web app route.<p>Now, if I was building a <i>video processing<\/i> app today, I&#x27;d almost certainly go native, but in a couple of years, my answer may be very different."],"time":["2020-05-17 17:07:35"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["creativecupcak3"],"id":[23216470],"kids":{},"parent":[23211851],"text":["I will try my best to be nice about this.

But let&#x27;s be real, one of the main reasons a lot of these tech companies like Discord&#x2F;Slack is jumping on the Electron wagon is money. It&#x27;s cheaper to have one team of developers, than 3 for each platform. But even that argument feels a little weird to me when stuff like Qt that is 100X more mature than Electron will ever be exists. And before anyone asks, as long as you open source your app, Qt is completely free.<p>I do think that in SOME cases an Electron app MIGHT make sense. But cluttering native platforms with all this bloat is like riding a horse to work on your 40 mile commute instead of your Honda. Even that&#x27;s a horrible analogy because your Honda is terrible for the Earth. But hopefully you get my point.<p>This lack of concern for computational resources by us programmers is utterly discouraging.

If you type `$point`, then click on the canvas, &quot;$point&quot; is replaced with code representing that point. The simplicity of this interface for writing code that heavily involves numbers in context (ie on their domain) is an inspiration. There are probably a couple of names for this connectivity, but one might be bi-directional evaluation.

There. Is. No. Machine.  (Insert matrix meme here.)  Before you open up your cluster to the rest of company, drill it down to them.  Maybe even create a Google Form where they have to sign &quot;I hereby acknowledge that there is no machine in k8s and any attempt to tie my job to a particular machine means a broken config by definition.&quot;<p>2. Thanks to 1, don&#x27;t let anyone use hostNetwork, hostIPC, hostPID, hostPorts, host whatever, unless you have a really good reason to (with explicit approval process).<p>3. Don&#x27;t let anybody start a job without memory&#x2F;CPU limit.  Make sure they understand that, if the job goes over the memory limit, it dies, and it&#x27;s not k8s admin&#x27;s problem.<p>4. You can&#x27;t log anything into the pod - when the pod dies the log is gone.  You can&#x27;t log into the machine, either (see 1).  Therefore, you really need some kind of logging framework that takes the log from your pod and saves it, in its raw form, somewhere safe (like S3).  I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s any such framework, but there had better be.<p>5. Make sure every manual operation is logged (who did what to which job when), unless you like asking &quot;@here Does anybody know who owns fooservice?&quot; every month.<p>6. Kubernetes is not magic: if it takes thirty minutes to provision your service, fix that, instead of moving thirty minutes of manual provisioning into k8s and somehow expect it to be magically reliable.<p>7. Don&#x27;t bring in existing dependencies uncritically.  If your job connects to a zookeeper server to find out its peers, don&#x27;t bring it into k8s, but rewrite it to use k8s service instead.<p>8. Take extra extra care when writing down your first job specification, because there are a lot of yaml files to write, and people will just copy what&#x27;s already there.  If your first k8s job mounts host &#x2F;tmp directory just because you were testing something and forgot to delete the line, soon you will have fifty jobs all mounting host &#x2F;tmp directory.  Good luck figuring out which job actually needs it then.<p>Yeah, again, I&#x27;m by no means an expert - I&#x27;m not even an admin, so just consider the list as a rambling of some poor soul who has seen some stuff.

It&#x27;s not always as harmful as it might sound to the novice.<p>It&#x27;s important to understand that CPU resource requests are used for scheduling and not for limiting. As the author suggests, this can be an issue when there is CPU contention, but on the other hand, it might not be. That&#x27;s because memory limits are even more important than CPU requests when scheduling: most applications use far more memory as a proportion of overall host resources than CPU.<p>Let&#x27;s take an example. Suppose we have a 64GB worker node with 8 CPUs in it. Now suppose we have a number of pods to schedule on it, each with a memory limit of 2GB and a CPU request of 1 millicore (0.001CPU). On this node, we will be able to accommodate 32 such pods.<p>Now suppose one of the pods gets busy. This pod can have all the idle CPU it wants! That&#x27;s because it&#x27;s a request and not a limit.<p>Now suppose <i>all<\/i> of the pods become fully CPU contended. The way the Linux scheduler works is that it will use the CPU request as a <i>relative weight<\/i> with respect to the other processes in the parent cgroup. It doesn&#x27;t matter that they&#x27;re small as an absolute value; what matters is their relative proportion. So if they&#x27;re all 1 millicore, they will all get equal time. In this example, we have 32 pods and 8 CPUs, so under full contention, each will get 0.25 CPU shares.<p>So when I talk to customers about resource planning, I actually usually recommend that they start with low CPU reservation, and optimize for memory consumption <i>until<\/i> their workloads dictate otherwise. It does happen that particularly greedy pods are out there, but that&#x27;s not the typical case - and for those that are, they will often allocate all of a worker&#x27;s CPUs in which case you might as well dedicate nodes to them and forget about how to micromanage the situation."],"time":["2020-05-17 22:07:53"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["bavell"],"id":[23212982],"kids":[23214390,23214630],"parent":[23211325],"text":["Great article, I&#x27;ve learned many of these firsthand and agree with their conclusions.

If you set things up so this failure won’t surface, like allowing the readiness check to take that pod out of service until the congestion subsides, you’re only hurting yourself by masking the issue. It basically means your readiness check is like a latency exception handler outside the application, very bad idea.<p>The other item that is way more complicated than it seems is the issue about IAM roles &#x2F; service accounts instead of single shared credentials.<p>In cases where your company has an enterprise security team that creates extremely low-friction tools to generate service account credentials and inject them, then sure, I would agree it’s a best practice to ruthlessly split the credentialing of every application to a shared resource, so you can isolate access and revoking.<p>But if you are on some application team and your company doesn’t have a mature enough security tooling setup managed by a separate security team, this can become a bad idea.<p>It can lead to superlinear growth in secrets management as there will be manual service account creation and credential propagation overhead for every separate application. Non-security engineers will store things in a password manager, copy&#x2F;paste into some CI&#x2F;CD tool, embed credentials as ENV permanently in a container, etc., all because they can’t create and maintain the end to end service account credential tools in addition to their job as an application team engineer. It’s something they think about twice per year and need off their plate immediately to move on to other work.<p>Across teams it means you end up with 20 different team-specific ways to cope with rapid growth of service accounts, leading to an even worse security surface area, risk of credential-based outages, omission of important testing because ensuring ability to impersonate the right service account at the right place is too hard, etc.<p>Very often it is a <i>real<\/i> trade-off to consider that one single service account credential that has just one way to be injected for every service is <i>safer<\/i> in the bigger picture.<p>Yes it means a credential issue for any service becomes an issue for all, and this is a risk and you want automated tooling to mitigate it, but it very often will be less of a risk than insisting on a parochial best practice of individual service account credentials, resulting in much worse and less auditable secrets workflows overall <i>unless<\/i> it is completely owned and operated by a central security team in such a way that it doesn’t create any approval delays or workflow friction for application teams."],"time":["2020-05-17 21:04:46"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["lolkube"],"id":[23212659],"kids":[23212879,23212827],"parent":[23211325],"text":["#1: Using Kubernetes"],"time":["2020-05-17 17:34:13"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["gridlockd"],"id":[23215405],"kids":{},"parent":[23211325],"text":["Common mistake: using Kubernetes"],"time":["2020-05-17 22:56:07"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["sixhobbits"],"id":[23216474],"kids":[23216699,23216549,23219065,23216899],"parent":[23211325],"text":["This also needs a companion post called &quot;common mistakes: using kubernetes&quot;.<p>I feel like it&#x27;s a weekly occurrence now where I hear of a startup launching their mvp on kubernetes having spent 8 months too long on Dev as a result.<p>The other day in an interview someone bragged to me how he had convinced his team to spend 12 months moving to K8s.

If you solve that by running an app on their device, then oh boy are you going to have fun testing.<p>I prefer scaling out. The stackoverflow peeps prefer scaling up. There are some great write-ups about how they scale. I found this [1] one after some quick googling, but I am certain there are more.

I once replaced a system that ran on 10 32-core machines with one that ran on one with four cores on one machine and did the work in the same time. Another time I had 96 cores, more threads, and I replaced it with one that had three threads and was faster.<p>But both of those solutions were evolutionary dead-ends. The tasks were very specific, and not subject to change. The first one was a single C file. The latter was actually java, but with hand-rolled hash tables and optimistic locks. The first one I doubt I could follow it now.<p>My point is, you can have understandable systems that good people (as opposed to geniuses) can work on, evolve and adapt, and that have well understood failure modes and scaling cliffs. Or you can have bonkers code that everyone is afraid to touch, and which fails in production when it hit a cliff you didn&#x27;t know about and now your site is dead for eight days.<p>If you can strike a good balance, then you&#x27;ll probably have some combination of distributed, and brute force.<p>[1] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;highscalability.com&#x2F;stack-overflow-architecture\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;highscalability.com&#x2F;stack-overflow-architecture<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-18 03:32:43"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["evadne"],"id":[23213438],"kids":[23216441],"parent":[23212573],"text":["Do you have a moment to talk about our Lord and Saviour, Erlang&#x2F;OTP?"],"time":["2020-05-17 19:18:06"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["crazygringo"],"id":[23215028],"kids":[23215184,23217331],"parent":[23212573],"text":["Of course they do.

I didn&#x27;t release the results but I was quite happy with what I managed. Honestly, I should probably contribute to these projects.<p>Annoyingly, certain parts of the Windows UI cannot be recreated with just HTML and CSS. One of these is how focusing works. I don&#x27;t know what the proper names for it are, but Windows has two kinds of focus:<p>• Dotted line (or flashing cursor for text boxes). If you press space bar, something will happen with this element.<p>• Black outline around the outside. If you press Enter, this button&#x27;s action will be triggered. This is why the OK button in a typical Windows dialogue box looks different to the Cancel button. I don&#x27;t remember what this looks like in XP but I think it uses a thicker blue border.<p>However, the browser only really has the former kind of focus — even for HTML buttons in Internet Explorer on Windows 95!

I worked with farmers as a fertilizer company agronomist for twenty years.  If I understand it correctly Tillable is trying to insert themselves in the middle, acquire the right to sublease large amounts of land and mark it up.<p>Say you own a farm and lease it out.  The family you lease your land to might be a neighbor.  In the winter they might plow your driveway gratis.  They add fertilizer and lime as needed.  I&#x27;ve known farmers to even add small amounts of drainage tile at the beginning of a lease.<p>Now consider I&#x27;m a super large farmer who has rented your land through Tillable.  Farming is a super thin margin business.  I live two counties over so I am not going to plow out your driveway or look after your farm for you. I will pay top dollar, I will in effect mine your land to make  a profit.<p>I won&#x27;t put on fertilizer if levels are high and skip the lime.  I will make a nice profit for a few years and then when yields drop I will drop the lease.  Over time the price of the lease will drop sharply.  So in effect the landlord will gain a few bucks short term but lose big time over the long term.<p>On a small scale I&#x27;ve seen this happen.  When the landlord offers it back to the original renter he will be shocked and angry when he either refuses or offers a pittance.<p>The landlord either has to invest his own money on lime and fertilizer building the farm back up or have a series of short time renters from outside the county who take a chance on the land."],"time":["2020-05-17 11:06:20"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ISL"],"id":[23209328],"kids":[23209777,23210248],"parent":[23208954],"text":["This is the first I&#x27;ve heard of Tillable.

My brother had an AWS Lambda error message when he tried to access his exam the first time; CollegeBoard had surpassed their Lambda service limits (Fortunately he was able to access his exam after trying again).<p>Their online tooling has never been great–AP Classroom takes at least 3 tries for me to access, one to log in again which then redirects back to AP Central, one that just redirects back to AP Central, then finally one that takes me to my assignments page.<p>This certainly isn&#x27;t an easy problem to solve.

We need to stop conflating social development, socialized childcare, and education systems.<p>Here&#x27;s my shitlist:<p>* Children should attempt hard problems that they can make progress on, but probably cannot solve. It is wrong that schools give nearly zero exposure to truly hard problems, and plenty of exposure to trivilally solvable problems. And no, making them tease out the meaning of a word-problem doesn&#x27;t qualify as difficulty. I mean give them a problem that makes them find a wikipedia page and learn on their own.<p>* Computers are here to stay. I remember when I was little, I was told that I wouldn&#x27;t always have a calculator on me. That is \ndemonstrably false, I literally do not go anywhere without a computer in my pocket. Furthermore, that computer has a WolframAlpha app that can interface with server clusters running the most advanced computer algebra systems in existence. Why did I learn stoichiometry? <i>There is something deeply wrong with education if students could easily pass an AP Physics exam with access to WolframAlpha, and will (probably) have access to WolframAlpha in every practical application of their AP physics education, but are artificially prevented from having access during the exam.<\/i> Why don&#x27;t the tests correspond to real-world application of the subject? Oh, it&#x27;s more convenient for you to evaluate it this way? That&#x27;s tough shit, figure it out.<p>* Students should have an entire day dedicated to math, and then they should have an entire day dedicated to English, etc. Some students might get bored and tired, sure, because sometimes learning isn&#x27;t pleasant. But over and over on this site we hear that successful developers are the people who are able to maintain focus for long periods of time on difficult problems. Why do students waste 35 minutes a day switching classrooms?<p>* There is not enough differentiation of students. Advanced students have so much of their time wasted. The advanced 3rd graders should be hanging out with advanced 6th graders.<p>The way that the education system is collapsing from cheating and going online-only is nothing short of exciting to me. A lot had to go wrong for us to get to this point -- answer banks exist because everyone uses the same textbook and the same curriculum. Cheating with other students exists because group-work is the natural state of humans. Students aren&#x27;t excited about the work they do because they sense that there&#x27;s a magical oracle on the internet with the solution to the simple problems they&#x27;re solving.<p>It&#x27;s all going to fall apart and that&#x27;s something to celebrate. The thing that I&#x27;m most afraid of is that Americans have lost the ability to take risks at aggregate and think radically about redesigning institutions. All of these problems that I&#x27;m talking about are just as bad in every other country in the world. Some country is going to figure it out and they&#x27;re going to reap the rewards, and I&#x27;m afraid that America isn&#x27;t brave enough anymore to be the first."],"time":["2020-05-17 23:17:02"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["eanzenberg"],"id":[23215298],"kids":[23216019,23215653,23216359],"parent":[23214336],"text":["Honeypotting minors is so unethical I don’t know where to begin.

It&#x27;s great that so many people ask, because it suggests that libsodium has successfully lodged itself into our collective consciousness. Both of these projects are forces for good in the world: they replace error-prone low-level crypto libraries with high-level interfaces designed for use by generalist developers.<p>I&#x27;ve reviewed projects that used Tink but never built one myself. So, grain of Nacl (haha i kill me). I&#x27;ve used libsodium in anger many times. Here&#x27;s roughly my comparison:<p>* Both libsodium and Tink will do authenticated (&quot;seal&#x2F;unseal&quot;) cryptography using GCM (the deficient but de facto standard) or Chapoly (Bernstein&#x27;s primitives). Tink will also do EAX, an AES AEAD that&#x27;s less fragile in some ways than GCM, and, on the C++ platform, AES-GCM-SIV, which is both fast and misuse-resistant.<p>* Both libsodium and Tink will do streaming authenticated encryption (efficiently sealing and unsealing files and streams that are too large to buffer entirely in memory before transforming).<p>* Tink will do deterministic authenticated encryption with AES-SIV; Tink provides this feature for building things like encrypted search features but I think it&#x27;s more commonly used as a safety feature for scenarios where nonce reuse is likely and revealing duplicate messages is not a major threat.<p>* Both libsodium and Tink will do ED25519 signatures. Tink will also do P-curve signatures and RSA.<p>* Both libsodium and Tink will do hybrid encryption (what libsodium would call &quot;box&quot;). libsodium uses Curve25519 and Chapoly; Tink uses P-curves and either GCM or CTR+HMAC (both of them AEAD modes).<p>* Tink has direct support for a bunch of platforms, notably including Java; unlike Tink, libsodium is, and thus has direct support for, C projects, and is provided for other languages through its C bindings. Tink has first-class C++ support (and its Python support is bindings to its C++ version), but not C.<p>* libsodium has much better documentation and a much bigger community. Tink is a Google project (it&#x27;s the evolution of Keyczar, Google&#x27;s first high-level cryptography library). On the other hand, Daniel Bleichenbacher is on the Tink team. I don&#x27;t love P-curve crypto, but I&#x27;ll use an implementation Bleichenbacher put his name on.<p>* Tink has better key management features and direct support for GCP and AWS KMS. It&#x27;s not hard to build that feature for libsodium, but it&#x27;s there already in Tink. Tink may get support for Android Strongbox (it already has support for the Android key storage API); it&#x27;s probably a really strong choice for Android applications already.<p>They&#x27;re both valid choices. If I was making a recommendation to a stranger without much context, I&#x27;d almost always recommend libsodium, unless you&#x27;re doing Android. If it was me, on a new project, I might lean towards Tink at this point.<p>Happy to be corrected if I got any of this wrong."],"time":["2020-05-17 20:45:59"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["antpls"],"id":[23211722],"kids":{},"parent":[23211355],"text":["Previous discussion (2018) : <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=17877616\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=17877616<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-17 15:09:26"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["todotask"],"id":[23217736],"kids":{},"parent":[23211355],"text":["There is an open issue for adding Tink information into Wikipedia, if anyone who is knowledgable to take this task will be appreciated.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;google&#x2F;tink&#x2F;issues&#x2F;133\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;google&#x2F;tink&#x2F;issues&#x2F;133<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-18 04:46:50"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["todotask"],"id":[23211724],"kids":[23211928],"parent":[23211355],"text":["The following article:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;asecuritysite-when-bob-met-alice&#x2F;go-and-do-crypto-1edd8da909ec\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;asecuritysite-when-bob-met-alice&#x2F;go-and-d...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-17 15:09:56"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["folex"],"id":[23211683],"kids":[23213340,23211747,23211900,23212152],"parent":[23211355],"text":["I hoped this one wouldn&#x27;t depend on WebCrypto (in Javascript), but seems like it is dependent :( No cryptography without https, still.<p>I just don&#x27;t get it: why can&#x27;t I use `ed25519.sign` without being on secure origin.<p>The only reason I can think of is: don&#x27;t allow people to create p2p networks without CA control and approval.

I will definitely not install social media apps like tiktok, snapchat or anything similar and the only one i keep is linkedin, which while is becoming a little bit like facebook it is still a bit relevant on job searching. Personally i have found myself all these weeks without them; i realized who my real friends are (the ones who can drop me a call to hang out, not the ones who will always message me in messenger or viber like i am a bot on the other side), i have more desire to start new hobbies, read, play board games and meet new actual people.<p>I am not the most social person ever, but it makes me sad how people and society have changed to the worst due to social media. I am seeing older people who found facebook in their 70s talking to and sharing gifs and silly emojis with their friends through messenger instead of calling or seeing each other. Same for all people of younger or similar age i have met; all the communication goes through social media even for the most complicated matters, like actual relationships, family discussions, serious talk etc. and even if you manage to convince them on an actual physical hangout, you have to go through the torture of multiple photos, posting, chatting, stories and whatever nonsense these social media platforms are promoting. Where is the actual fun of going out for a drink, to talk, to meet other people, to go to a concert or even travel anymore?"],"time":["2020-05-17 16:20:52"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["blfr"],"id":[23208881],"kids":[23208962,23211981,23212215],"parent":[23208423],"text":["<i>However, the treatment group also became less knowledgeable about current events.<\/i><p>Apparently, they couldn&#x27;t identify any downsides to quitting Facebook."],"time":["2020-05-17 04:10:51"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Priem19"],"id":[23211845],"kids":{},"parent":[23208423],"text":["Added this article to <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.quitfacebook.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.quitfacebook.org<\/a> a while ago.
