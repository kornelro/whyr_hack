The same house that cost my parents a ridiculously high mortgage (10% was pretty normal in the 70&#x27;s here) can now be had for a fraction of the inflation adjusted wages today. Even though the on-paper value of the house is roughly 10x what it cost back then.<p>To fix the rental market a lot of new housing would have to be built, but then you run into zoning issues, transportation issues, the price of land and other limitations that make it hard to expand affordable housing for cities. Historically institutional investors (for instance: pension funds) would fund these developments but since they now have shorter time horizons for their ROI and want higher returns they are not as interested as they used to be to pick this up.<p>This problem will not resolve easily or even at all as long as people are willing to pay high rents and the market is as restricted as it is I would expect rents to continue to go up. Even an increase in interest will likely not return all that many houses to the rental market because that would require the sticker price of houses to come down, which hardly even happens.

He has a book about it [1]<p>This aligns well with Patrick&#x27;s graph: healthcare, college, childcare are all labor intensive and have seen little to no productivity increase in the last 23 years.<p>The story for housing is different, though. We are consistently concentrating economic opportunity in the urban centers. However, through NIMBYism, we have made it very difficult to build new housing. The &quot;surprising&quot; result: very expensive housing. Relatedly, Matt Rognlie found out [2] that the increase in the capital share of income since 1970, as noticed by Piketty, can be mostly explained by the housing sector.<p>The solution to both, in my view, are related. We need to reduce barriers for labor movement. We can reduce labor cost by liberalizing immigration to the USA and by liberalizing (re-zoning) and incentivizing (via Land Value Taxation) housing production within the main US urban areas.<p>&gt; Why do there seem to be more examples of rapidly-completed major projects in the past than the present?<p>My suspicion is institutional ossification in the USA. With time we accumulate rules &#x2F; regulations &#x2F; procedures that increase the complexity of the task at hand. Eventually, the marginal procedure increases complexity such that our competence is exceeded, making the task impossible.<p>I think the solution is related to his other question &quot;How do you ensure an adequate replacement rate in systems that have no natural way to die?&quot;. We should have a way to replace these institutions. Market forces are a great way to do so for private endeavors, startups being the prime example. But for public institutions, it is less clear what could be the proper approach. If there was a way to have states compete for citizens in a non-violent way, that may help.<p>&gt; Why don&#x27;t we build nice neighborhoods any more?<p>I think it is a mixture of i) survivorship bias (as he suggests), ii) car-oriented development (as he suggests), and iii) the fact that attractive neighborhoods have an organic feel to them that only time can give. Thus, in the car-era we built new neighborhoods but they were car-oriented so they never aged into nice, walking neighborhoods. We are trying to rectify that with new walking-oriented developments, but they have a synthetic feel to them that will only go away with time.<p>&gt; What&#x27;s going on with infrastructure?<p>I would say this is a combination of the Baumol cost disease and the ossification of our institutions (both mentioned above).<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Baumol%27s_cost_disease\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Baumol%27s_cost_disease<\/a><p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.goodreads.com&#x2F;book&#x2F;show&#x2F;46013009-why-are-the-prices-so-damn-high\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.goodreads.com&#x2F;book&#x2F;show&#x2F;46013009-why-are-the-pri...<\/a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.brookings.edu&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2016&#x2F;07&#x2F;2015a_rognlie.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.brookings.edu&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2016&#x2F;07&#x2F;2015a_r...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-08-24 12:30:51"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["nzdhandala"],"id":[24256869],"kids":{},"parent":[24256676],"text":["Regulations are out of control.

I too am a Shopify app developer with 4 apps in the App Store, currently doing around $56k&#x2F;mo and growing ~$2k&#x2F;mo for the last 2 years.<p>Biggest thing is that the ramp up time is very slow. You&#x27;re not going to get a bombastic number of installs starting off, no matter how much marketing you purchase. It&#x27;s a slow climb up and the best time to launch your app is yesterday. Plan on one to two years to see decent revenue, and then hopefully continue to grow it for the next few years after that.<p>Shopify Plus customers and traffic spikes are definitely a big concern, especially when it comes to your pricing model. Everytime I&#x27;ve come up with a &quot;worst case&quot; scenario it has happened so you need to always have built-in contingencies around that. Whether that means reaching out to the store to create a unique plan&#x2F;pricing for them and possibly adding more value services. For example, one of our apps gets between 25k to 100k webhooks per hour and the spikes are unpredictable. Our app also has a queue system to process jobs in the background which can mean there are anywhere from a thousand tasks in queue, or 500k. (Shopify API is slow and limiting for big, heavy tasks).<p>If you are also an actual Shopify developer (theme or private app developer) there is a lot of opportunities for upsells depending on what your app does. It seems a lot of app developers in the App Store simply have apps out there to get leads for development (service) work.<p>Overall, developing on Shopify has been really good. There are some annoyances with their REST API vs. GraphQL API, their documentation, their support, etc... But generally it&#x27;s been smooth sailing for the past few years.

Sponsored data is someone other than the user paying the ISP&#x27;s charge for user&#x27;s data from a particular source (usually data from the entity paying for it). (In cases like HBO and AT&amp;T, where the company paying for the data and the ISP are part of the same company or subsidiaries of the same company, I&#x27;d count that as a form of disguised zero rating rather than sponsored data).<p>The case for regulating zero-rating is much stronger than the case for regulating sponsored data.<p>Note that a company could in effect do sponsored data without even having an arrangement with an ISP. E.g., a company could keep track on its end of how much data from them each customer used each month, map that to ISPs based on IP address, and then give each customer a discount on their monthly bill based on that ISPs rates and that customers use.<p>Let&#x27;s call this &quot;manual sponsored data&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s hard to make a case that manual sponsored data is automatically bad, of even usually bad. Companies are usually allowed to bundle products from other companies or provide discounts on products from other companies that go well with theirs.<p>In particular, its hard to make a case that even if someone does do manual sponsored data in a way that is bad, we need separate regulation for it instead of letting it be dealt with under antitrust just like you do for other third-party bundling arrangements.<p>But if manual sponsored data is allowed, it is then hard to make the case that it is bad to allow ISPs to facilitate it by offering a service where they track the usage for you, and then bill you for your customer&#x27;s data usage instead of billing the customer.<p>Zero-rating, on the other hand, because it is the ISP itself choosing what to zero-rate, and because the ISP is providing last mile infrastructure for which there is very little competition in most areas, is much more likely to be anti-competitive.<p>It could still also be dealt with by antitrust, but because it is already taking place under highly constrained competition you can make a decent argument that it is worth specialized regulation.<p>Conflating the two just makes it much less likely that such regulation will happen."],"time":["2020-08-24 17:39:42"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["daniel-s"],"id":[24260743],"kids":[24263629],"parent":[24258216],"text":["Correct me if I&#x27;m wrong, but aren&#x27;t the ISP monopolies in the US all&#x2F;mostly the result of government monopoly protection&#x2F;non-compete agreements with cities?<p>When governments grant monopolies the consumers get screwed.

More concretely, if we say that there are some underlying factors which correlate to both student &quot;quality&quot; and to admissions scores, and some random factors, we&#x27;ll find that score and quality are correlated, but the highest quality students and the ones with the highest scores aren&#x27;t the same ones. This is easier to explain using a graph: if we assume that &quot;score&quot; and &quot;quality&quot; are two gaussian variables, we get a graph that looks like<p><pre><code>    16 ^ Quality\n    15 |                 #####BBBB  \n    14 |              ########BBBBA \n    13 |           ###########BBBBAA\n    12 |         #############BBBBAA\n    11 |       ###############CCCCAA\n    10 |     #################CCCCAA\n     9 |    ##################CCCCA \n     8 |   ###################CCCC  \n     7 |  ####################CCC   \n     6 | #####################CC    \n     5 | #####################      \n     4 | ###################        \n     3 | #################          \n     2 |  #############             \n     1 |   #########                \n       +----+----+----+----+----+----+&gt;\n       0    5    10   15   20   25   30\n                    Score\n\n<\/code><\/pre>\nIf you do the naive thing, and grab the very highest-scoring students, we set the cutoff at 27, and get all 10 of the students labeled by A in the above diagram, thus have a quality distribution of 10 - 14, with the bulk being around 10 - 13, and the average score being 11.5. If we instead set the cutoff at 23, we get 47 students (labelled B for students above the average of the originally selected ones, and C for the ones below that average) -- if we then pick among them randomly, we&#x27;ll get a flatter distribution ranging from a low score of 6 to a high score of 15, with an average of 10.98. The distribution of scores looks like<p><pre><code>    Score | Strict | Cutoff&#x2F;\n          | Cutoff | Random\n    ------+--------+--------\n       15 |  0.00% |  8.51%\n       14 | 10.00% | 10.64%\n       13 | 20.00% | 12.77%\n       12 | 20.00% | 12.77%\n       11 | 20.00% | 12.77%\n       10 | 20.00% | 12.77%\n        9 | 10.00% | 10.64%\n        8 |  0.00% |  8.51%\n        7 |  0.00% |  6.38%\n        6 |  0.00% |  4.26%\n<\/code><\/pre>\nSo if you care a lot about simply not getting bad students, and not very much about getting the very best ones, you should do a strict cutoff, since that will give you the highest possible average.

These lower tier students get a better chance in a lottery, at the expense of people who through better work&#x2F;aptitude&#x2F;achievement&#x2F;(and no small amount of luck, finance, or legacy also) would otherwise usually get in with high likelihood.

Or let&#x27;s call it incentives produced by such a system?<p>Well, perhaps it&#x27;s that students, who throughout school are taught to study hard, do well, apply themselves, at the end face a selection that tosses that out the window and says, well, everyone is equally good and we&#x27;re going to do a lottery.   We&#x27;re lowering the bar so that everyone who got above a B average has an equal chance of getting into Harvard.<p>Is that teaching them the right lesson?  Is that incentivizing people to excel and be really good at something?

Now, I don&#x27;t dispute that there&#x27;s a lot of unnecessary pressure on students today.

The amount of web traffic that SQLite can handle depends on how heavily the website uses its database. Generally speaking, any site that gets fewer than 100K hits&#x2F;day should work fine with SQLite. The 100K hits&#x2F;day figure is a conservative estimate, not a hard upper bound. SQLite has been demonstrated to work with 10 times that amount of traffic.<p>&gt; The SQLite website (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sqlite.org&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sqlite.org&#x2F;<\/a>) uses SQLite \n&gt; itself, of course, and as of this writing (2015) it handles \n&gt; about 400K to 500K HTTP requests per day, about 15-20% of \n&gt; which are dynamic pages touching the database. Dynamic \n&gt; content uses about 200 SQL statements per webpage. This \n&gt; setup runs on a single VM that shares a physical server \n&gt; with 23 others and yet still keeps the load average below \n&gt; 0.1 most of the time.&quot; (Source: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sqlite.org&#x2F;whentouse.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sqlite.org&#x2F;whentouse.html<\/a>)<p>So SQlite is quite a valid choice if you need a database and stay below ~500k HTTP requests per day.

If you underpay on some trips and overpay on others and it is a net wash, then it doesn&#x27;t really matter for the couriers if the payment algorithm is on the low side on some trips so long as it is on the high side on other trips.<p>Under or overpaying on trips is more of an interest to those engineers trying to optimize marketplace efficiency. Meal delivery businesses have as much of an interest in not underpaying as doing so reduces supply availability and therefore reliability and they have also an interest in not overpaying as that reduces profitability. The ultimate goal is optimal pricing in a three sided market to maximize liquidity as the business model does best when you optimize for volume of transactions. Maximizing liquidity amortizes fixed costs over more transactions. This applies as much to the meal delivery companies as to the restaurants involved.<p>At the end of the day, distance driven is very imperfect as you have issues like poor GPS signal and in cities you have the dilemma of urban canyons and tunnels. Also, drivers don&#x27;t always take the suggested route. At vehicle speeds, it&#x27;s hard problem to solve due to time between GPS pings. Another issue besides GPS inaccuracy is clock inaccuracy, especially with round-trip times between server and client and client and server aren&#x27;t always symmetrical, especially on cellular networks, and this messes up all sorts of clock synchronization strategies. The peanut gallery on HN is seriously underestimating the complexity of measuring distance using GPS. It&#x27;s pretty darn good when conditions are ideal, but when they aren&#x27;t, good luck.<p>Another question is the magnitude of the underpayment in the 21% of trips.

Are you a moral entity or not?<p>In the West, we say your humanity is intrinsically, unalienably situated in your person, bestowed upon you by a higher authority even than society itself. It may at times be recognized or unrecognized by the crooked timber of human institutions, but with or without them, it exists. You are a human being even if society doesn&#x27;t want you to be, for whatever reason.<p>Compare and contrast with Ubuntu:<p>&gt; According to Michael Onyebuchi Eze, the core of ubuntu can best be summarised as follows:<p>&gt; <i>&#x27;A person is a person through other people&#x27;<\/i> strikes an affirmation of one’s humanity through recognition of an ‘other’ in his or her uniqueness and difference. It is a demand for a creative intersubjective formation in which the ‘other’ becomes a mirror (but only a mirror) for my subjectivity. This idealism suggests to us that <i>humanity is not embedded in my person solely as an individual; my humanity is co-substantively bestowed upon the other and me.<\/i><p>Again, cutting through the obstructive bafflegab:<p><i>&#x27;A person is a person through other people&#x27;<\/i><p><i>humanity is not embedded in my person solely as an individual<\/i><p>The examples given are even more grotesque.<p>&gt; When someone behaves according to custom, a Sotho-speaking person would say “ke motho,” which means &quot;he&#x2F;she is a human.&quot;<p>&gt; The aspect of this that would be exemplified by a tale told (often, in private quarters) in Nguni “kushone abantu ababili ne Shangaan,” in Sepedi “go tlhokofetje batho ba babedi le leShangane,” in English <i>(two people died and one Shangaan).<\/i> In each of these examples, humanity comes from conforming to or being part of the tribe.<p>In other words, three people died, but only one &quot;human&quot;. Think deeply on the implications of that.<p>Growing beyond this kind of tribal denial of humanity has always been one of the proudest achievements of the West.

That might be a link between Africa and<p>“ &quot;Ubuntu&quot; as political philosophy encourages community equality, propagating the distribution of wealth. This socialisation is a vestige of agrarian peoples as a hedge against the crop failures of individuals. Socialisation presupposes a community population with which individuals empathise and concomitantly, have a vested interest in its collective prosperity. Urbanisation and the aggregation of people into an abstract and bureaucratic state undermines this empathy. African Intellectual historians like Michael Onyebuchi Eze have argued however that this ideal of &quot;collective responsibility&quot; must not be understood as absolute in which the community&#x27;s good is prior to the individual&#x27;s good. On this view, ubuntu it is argued, is a communitarian philosophy that is widely differentiated from the Western notion of communitarian socialism. In fact, ubuntu induces an ideal of shared human subjectivity that promotes a community&#x27;s good through an unconditional recognition and appreciation of individual uniqueness and difference.[12] Audrey Tang has suggested that Ubuntu &quot;implies that everyone has different skills and strengths; people are not isolated, and through mutual support they can help each other to complete themselves.&quot;[13]<p>&quot;Redemption&quot; relates to how people deal with errant, deviant, and dissident members of the community. The belief is that man is born formless like a lump of clay. It is up to the community, as a whole, to use the fire of experience and the wheel of social control to mould him into a pot that may contribute to society. Any imperfections should be borne by the community and the community should always seek to redeem man. ...”"],"time":["2020-08-25 00:04:03"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["op03"],"id":[24261167],"kids":{},"parent":[24260045],"text":["more grist - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;riskmagazine.nl&#x2F;article&#x2F;2018-09-30-ubuntu-vague-philosophy-or-valuable-concept\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;riskmagazine.nl&#x2F;article&#x2F;2018-09-30-ubuntu-vague-phil...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-08-24 16:45:13"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["omginternets"],"id":[24262199],"kids":[24262389],"parent":[24260045],"text":["&gt;Ubuntu can literally be translated as &quot;I am what I am because of what we all are&quot;, ie., that individual meaning is bound up with collective meaning.<p>In philosophical terms, Gilbert Ryle would argue that &quot;Self&quot; and &quot;Other&quot; are in the same <i>category<\/i>, just as up&#x2F;down, anxiety&#x2F;contentment, life&#x2F;death, black&#x2F;white are are different instances of the same stuff.<p>If you&#x27;re a zen Buddhist (or a fan of Alan Watts), you&#x27;re already familiar with this idea as well.

You can structure a mind map to resemble the associations you have in your own (duh) mental model of any body of knowledge you might be studying, and then it&#x27;s easy to navigate a map with your eyes to recall stuff and fill the gaps when things get cloudy in your head.

I tend to split it into two spectrums, the reference spectrum and the recall spectrum.<p>The reference spectrum ranges from looking up a small, discrete nugget of information to restoring a complex mental context.  At the &quot;small nugget&quot; end of the spectrum could be a command line invocation for a specific task, or your mother&#x27;s birthday.  In my experience, search works fine for this if you put in minimal effort when recording the information.<p>At the &quot;complex mental context&quot; end of the spectrum could be a project that you were immersed in six months ago and had to set aside.  Documentation for this purpose takes a lot of care; it&#x27;s essentially writing for another person.  If you&#x27;re not careful and systematic, you can end up accidentally taking a crucial aspect of context for granted and leaving it out.  To choose how to structure notes for this purpose, I think of myself as a consumer.  I have a lot of experience with consuming information, and I know what I like.  I don&#x27;t like mind maps.  I like complete sentences of clear, well-structured prose, with an occasional diagram, lightly hyperlinked where it&#x27;s helpful.  All I need is links, basic formatting, and occasionally embedded media.<p>The recall spectrum ranges from memorizing specific factoids to trying to cement more complex ideas so they&#x27;re available for thought later.  At the factoid end is anything that could fit on a flash card, such as the definition of a word or, whoops, my mother&#x27;s birthday, which probably belongs here under recall instead of under reference!  At the complex end of the recall spectrum is where I would like to put the best books I read.<p>Again, when taking notes for recall, I think of what helps me in my experience.  I like studying Anki cards for factoid recall.  For the complex end, I find the effort that is best rewarded is the work of writing straightforward, well-structured prose.  It&#x27;s very easy to sketch graphs and diagrams that <i>feel<\/i> meaningful, but the ease is a giveaway that you aren&#x27;t really mentally engaging.  Writing is much harder work, because it forces you to engage with the subject in a deeper way than just splashing a vague intuition down on the page.  The value is reflected in consumption:  well-written prose is invaluable, while most of the images that feel like they capture part of the mental context when I have it are no help in restoring it when I don&#x27;t.  (Technical subjects are an outlier; diagrams are often helpful.)  To be clear, since recall is the object, consumption is secondary; what is most important for me is that the act of <i>writing<\/i> well-structured prose helps cement the knowledge in my mind.  It&#x27;s just a nice bonus that if it doesn&#x27;t stick the first time, I&#x27;ll have exactly the kind of notes that are good for refreshing myself later.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but I think discussions of note-taking techniques and structures are skewed by the desire to create something visually impressive.  Nobody who is a professional at communicating information to others is using these techniques.  I&#x27;ve never heard anybody say, I need to find a mind map to improve my understanding of the French Revolution, or Franz Kafka, or Apache Kafka.  Mind maps and similar techniques have been around for many decades and have yet to prove themselves as a medium for teaching or communication.  I&#x27;m <i>very<\/i> skeptical of the idea that they have some great yet-to-be-exploited utility for communication, and I&#x27;m also skeptical of the idea that their value for personal use vastly exceeds their value for interpersonal use.

Markdown’s strict specified variation, Commonmark, seems like a pretty decent choice.<\/i><p>Markdown of any form would be a catastrophically bad choice for something like this. Remember this: <i>Markdown is all about HTML<\/i>. Markdown has serious limitations and is very poorly designed in places, but it works well enough despite being so bad specifically because underneath it’s all HTML, so you can fall down to that when necessary. If you go with Markdown, you’re not actually supporting “Markdown” as your language, but HTML. If the user writes HTML in their Markdown, what are you going to do about it? You’re supposed to be able to write the HTML equivalent of any given Markdown construct and have it work, and I find that perfectly normal documents <i>need<\/i> to write raw HTML <i>regularly<\/i>, because Markdown is so terribly limited—so your document web is either (a) not actually Markdown and uselessly crippled (seriously, plain Markdown without HTML is extremely limiting for documents), or (a) actually completely back to being a subset of HTML, which is exactly what you said you didn’t want it to be (rule #1).<p>If you want to get away from HTML, you want something like reStructuredText, where you <i>don’t<\/i> have access to HTML (unless the platform decides to set up a directive or role for raw HTML), but have a whole lot more semantic functionality, functionality that <i>had<\/i> to be included <i>because HTML wasn’t there to fall back on<\/i>. I think AsciiDoc is like this too.<p>But the whole premise that “HTML must be replaced because it’s a performance or accessibility bottleneck for documents” is just not in the slightest bit true. HTML is fine. Even CSS is well enough (though most pages have terribly done stylesheets that are far heavier than they should be, e.g. because they include four resets and duplicate everything as well as overriding font families five times). The problem lies almost entirely in what JavaScript makes <i>possible<\/i>—not that JavaScript is inherently a problem, but it makes problems <i>possible<\/i>. The proposed variety of document web would be unlikely to perform substantially better than the existing web with JavaScript disabled.<p>All up, Robert O’Callahan’s response is entirely correct. You can’t split the web like this; you will fail.

Anyone doing practical assessment of the idea (as opposed to table talk) knows there won&#x27;t be any, at least until all the infrastructure and human-driven cars are reorganized to inter-operate with automatic ones. “If the mountain won&#x27;t come to Muhammad…” — unfortunately, it is possible that people will have to adapt to robots instead of the other way round if everyone decides that it really is the future. It might be that the author believes the general idea of “car sharing” to be correct, and struggles to find the reason why the company loses money. The problem is that the whole thing is a lie.<p>Their business model is not self-driving taxis. As with other “platforms”, it&#x27;s just blatant cutting down on “irrelevant” expenses wile keeping the good bits to themselves under the pretense that they are just “operating the computer” that allows someone else to do “everything”. Uber might have a lot of money to smokescreen it, and keep the image of a middle-class citizen “sharing” the car for a certain price, but in other places competition between taxi companies rapidly “optimizing” and “professionalizing” the market makes it clear that humanity has pompously reinvented the hackney coach. Even worse, the unregulated hackney coach, when poorest peasants ride their carriages to a big city and work endless shifts trying to catch some passenger first to be able to feed themselves for a day, or some rickshaws fight and badmouth each other only to get the tiniest number of coins. A typical driver for a “digital” taxicab is a sleep-deprived immigrant (private person or an employee of an official subcontractor, there&#x27;s little difference) wielding a number of burner phones running client apps from different companies (BTW, location spoofing solutions market is booming) who is useless without a navigation (hooray for modern bio-robots), but jumps every red light to shave minutes off. The real sharing happens between drivers — they share shifts, devices, accounts, and cars. However, the only important thing is that the big company gets the commission from each and every ride, so it&#x27;s all good. They seem to make enough money to spend some on remediation when accidents happen, all while keeping their stance on being just a system operator that gratuitously helps clients. None of this is specifically modern. Immigrants working as cab drivers predate computers, and tricks that allow stretching of taxi car shifts are just as old.<p>Well, you can argue that there are ratings. (John Doe rated this driver 1&#x2F;5: We both died in a car crash. Would not recommend.) Well, anyone in any kind of “digital marketplace” business can tell you that the whole point of stars, likes, and the like is to make users believe that there is a complex system that protects them in the background, and that their input matters. The fact is, the owner and only the owner of the system decides whether any of that is used, and to what extent. Say, how are upvotes and downvotes on Youtube videos used? They are just a game, something for users to fidget and feel satisfaction from."],"time":["2020-08-25 02:13:32"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[24263914],"kids":{},"parent":[24262406],"text":{},"time":["2020-08-24 20:42:39"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":["sassycassie"],"id":[24264095],"kids":{},"parent":[24262406],"text":["interesting read."],"time":["2020-08-24 20:57:23"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["colordrops"],"id":[24257692],"kids":[24257912,24258168,24264393,24257758],"parent":[24257157],"text":["I tried for a while to get Wayland working in order to get rid of tearing I saw in X Windows, until I found out a kernel module parameter for the Nvidia driver fixed tearing in X.
