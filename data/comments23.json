Let&#x27;s be honest with ourselves, is any employer going to necessarily have the best practices with respecting your time, money and effort? It&#x27;s best to lay out those cards up front. Literally every red flag will demonstrate itself through the interviewer in most scenarios. Like any test, you get out of it what you give.<p>For example:<p>How many times do I feel this?<p>&quot;We take an extra time-slot &#x2F; day &#x2F; email chain in what is already a hypercompetitive market just to suss you out. We wait until the last stage of the interview process to do this because we still don&#x27;t totally trust you or understand anything you&#x27;ve done. We waste a lot of time creating elaborate puzzles that don&#x27;t really matter. We&#x27;re not going to pay you because our finances are already horribly mismanaged that it&#x27;s complicated to contract you out for the day and also we feel like you should be gladly externalizing your labor costs for our shiny position if you really love us. Drink the kool-aid.&quot;<p>Sometimes the technical interview surprises me. I always use it as a motivating example of myself as a candidates to work through a problem, show grit and also demonstrate when to ask for help. Ego and pride on both sides of the equation come into play and that&#x27;s always a worthwhile exercise before engaging it any longterm commitment. A good test accommodates and informs through failure. I learned this from administering the Putnam. Never got a decent score on it, but it was a worthwhile experience to fail. Interview tests are on the other hand, are not designed to teach anything except that you are unworthy.<p>My best roles have never asked for it. The company knew what they were looking for, were willing to trust me, were able to move along the interview process without losing me to a competitor and everyone was happy and they always pay competitively. Usually if there&#x27;s a technical interview involved at all, they have no idea what I can actually do. If they&#x27;re willing to waste time, effort and money on extra steps and are taking &quot;necessary precautions&quot; to subject you to what are essentially just litmus tests, then I&#x27;m sorry, that speaks to me a sense of your culture of mediocrity and dogmatic orthodoxy towards process.<p>Goodhart&#x27;s law. When a measure becomes a target, it stops being a good measure.\nWhen I was in school, we had other students take a year off to study for the Google interview. These were all affluent white men. At the same time, I had recruiters complaining to me that there were no decent black&#x2F;brown candidates in the pipeline. I remember hearing the same thing except as a child. Uhhh, there&#x27;s been plenty of time to invest into the local community. Recruiters would do well do understand to the history of the SAT as systemic racism, or literacy tests as systemic racism, or like any actual statistics as systemic racism. Everything that reduces candidates to numbers and quizzes feels rife for abuse. Who has the privilege to study an extra game on top of performing in a society that is already stacked against them? That&#x27;s not a question.<p>To wit, there&#x27;s the issue with a large number of candidates with junk resumes. There&#x27;s the outstanding issue of &quot;authenticity&quot; in professional acumen. There&#x27;s the whole problem with the industries underlying predatory behavior with regards to labor externalization and laundering numerical metrics, be it the rate of inclusion and diversity or the amount of hours actually demanded by management. What is so fundamentally wrong with the technical interview is that it&#x27;s just the cherry on top for what is already a miserable process. I&#x27;d so much rather just do free work for a potential client and just give it to them so it actually means something and is useful than waste any more time solving pointless puzzles, and this is from someone who specifically enjoyed studying hard pointless puzzles in school.<p>No, you can&#x27;t just show side projects. You should not be showing your work portfolio to anyone who isn&#x27;t paying you. If they were interested in open source, they&#x27;d already be paying you.<p>The technical interview is dead. Long live the technical interview."],"time":["2020-09-12 00:32:25"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mden"],"id":[24447013],"kids":{},"parent":[24446123],"text":["Most of the alternate approaches have their own severe failings:<p>Ask pertinent questions - a lot of candidates are bad at immediate summation and dissemination of information. There are many good engineers who have not learned how to sell their work, themselves, or in general communicate to the intent of a question. This is an invaluable skill, largely orthogonal to writing code, but it&#x27;s a skill that&#x27;s often learned with experience. Learning to ask level appropriate questions is hard and evaluating answers consistently (if not objectively) even harder. It is also largely insufficient in gauging programming ability. I&#x27;ve had co-workers who can talk about advanced architecture-y topics seemingly competently but struggle to write even relatively simple code.<p>Probationary period - I&#x27;ve never seen this implemented (excluding internships which sort of fall into this category) and it certainly sounds like a nice option to have available but I would bet many candidates would be afraid of a short probationary period (say 3 mo) especially if they have to move their family for the job. Being a professional and being told you are on a probationary period is stressful. At many large companies it can easily take more than 6wks to get up to any sort of productivity.<p>Walk through existing projects - most people (vast majority) do not have any sizable or clean or even &quot;interesting&quot; side project they would want to walk an interviewer through. Unless you worked on open-source for your previous employer (again minority of people) or on your spare time, this is not something you can get a strong signal out of.<p>Ask them to build something - err, I don&#x27;t see how this is that different than a coding challenge. And again, not everyone has personal projects ready to be shown to an interviewer. For example, the game I&#x27;m coding some nights after work does not look anything like code I write for my employer; there are no tests, there&#x27;s a lot of experimental and often dead code, functions are not neatly factored and thought out with an eye for collaboration, etc. I would not want to be judged by this code for an interview.<p>Pair programming - this sounds like a coding challenge but with a more empathetic interviewer. I don&#x27;t think this is an alternative, just a mild augmentation of a coding challenge.<p>Focus on ability to learn - companies do this but it&#x27;s usually considered supplementary to coding ability. Some companies explain their product and try to see if the candidate understands where the value of the product exists or at least where some of the challenges are. This could be spun out into a product type interview or a system design interview depending on intent.<p>Alternatives to white-boarding or do-at-home project interviews:\n- Provide a small existing but functional code base and ask the candidate to implement additional functionality. Downside is this takes a lot more effort to prepare and are limiting the candidate in regards to language they want to use.\n- Provide multiple options for a coding project or question and let the candidate choose which one they want to solve. This would hopefully reduce some of the luck factor of getting a question you know how to solve.\n- I can&#x27;t think of any others, but I&#x27;m sure they exist<p>One of the big desirable goals of interviews are evaluating candidates in a consistent manner. All interviewers have biases and these biases vary between the interviewers. Trying to account for that is, I believe, important but also very hard. Using the proposed alternatives would make it even much harder."],"time":["2020-09-11 22:29:44"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["hnrodey"],"id":[24447412],"kids":{},"parent":[24446123],"text":["so much complaining"],"time":["2020-09-11 23:18:33"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["swyx"],"id":[24445591],"kids":[24446196,24447942],"parent":[24444391],"text":["bit of a rant, but all very reasonable. in general though, i find that people who get this upset about semver tend to view the &quot;contract&quot; of semver to be an ironclad one (right down to being automatically determined by the package ecosystem rather than by the maintainer).<p>I am much more persuaded by the argument (not mine, i get this from more experienced maintainers) that semver is a <i>social<\/i> contract, because what constitutes a bugfix vs a new feature vs a breaking change is exactly as well defined as &quot;what is this piece of code really supposed to do&quot;? aka it&#x27;s not well defined at all. all software &quot;contracts&quot; are underspecified, given enough users and scale.<p>remember Hyrum&#x27;s Law: &quot;With a sufficient number of users of an API, it does not matter what you promise in the contract - all observable behaviors of your system will be depended on by somebody.&quot; Even bugs will be relied on and people get pissy about semver when you break them!"],"time":["2020-09-11 20:10:11"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["sz4kerto"],"id":[24446030],"kids":[24446103,24446163],"parent":[24444391],"text":["I don&#x27;t like semver.<p>If the library follows the rules, then...<p>Separation of minor and patch versions doesn&#x27;t make sense.

I don’t think the author actually understands why that is and has a few superficial gripes with how codebase are tested. That’s not to say that a lot of test suites are actually good (they’re not). That criticism may be fair.<p>Static types do not help at all with software quality, beyond catching some typos. You can never, ever write a static type that enforces anything of substance, because for that to happen you’d need to execute arbitrary code within the compiler (as happens with dependent types, and of course there is the constant fear of undecidable or infinite type checking in that system).<p>The classic example is that there’s an infinite number of functions with type int -&gt; int. The logic of these functions are extremely varied, and the type doesn’t help you at all. Enum types are very useful for knowing what values you are allowed to write, but don’t help with correctness.<p>The author brings up large input spaces, but conveniently leaves out input space partitioning, which any non-novice tester has to employ in their test case management.

Of course there’s combinatorial explosion, but that can be mitigated with constraints on the input combinations.<p>I’m not saying testing is perfect - it’s not.

Public Infrastructure in the disaster management system is a - disaster.<p>Example: Yes, my home village and the surrounding 20-30 Villages all have their old air-raid sirens to notify the members of the fire brigade. A system which is quite old and was rock solid reliable. During the transistion from analog radio to digital radio, the receivers were upgraded to be triggered by digital radio (TETRA to be precise). This, we found out, now means that during a power outage, there is no way to alert the fire brigade because the sirens dont have power. We now have people sitting in the fire station again whenever our Village has a power out to use the on-vehicle radio to communicate with the dispatch.<p>TETRA itself is also a disaster. And even worse: Its not even universally accepted. This means that local muncipalities can decide to stay with the old analog system while others have the new digital one. \nIn theory, the digital one has a bazillion advantages. However, all of those advantages in the end create more problems than they solve.<p>For example, better voice quality - just leads to people being completely not understandable when using breathing masks to enter a building (Something to do with filtering).<p>Also, analog fails gracefully. Digital stops working. And it stops working a lot earlier. This means, you now have to use a repeater at the entrance of a building to talk to people in the building, because the digital radio often does not work. This happens mostly in direct (Walkie Talkie Mode)<p>When in cellular mode, good luck finding a signal in 50% of the rural areas - This mode is vital to talk to the dispatcher to call for support&#x2F;additional units.<p>The whole system is supposed to be used by everyone. Military, Federal and Local Police, Fire Brigade, EMT... which means there has to be a rights management system to access certain channels. This is hardcoded into every device.

I can simultaneously call it a good step forward in the Node space and something I wouldn&#x27;t use for a new project. They&#x27;ve done a lot of work to build a system that, so long as you stay within very narrow lines and don&#x27;t ask too many questions, feels very cohesive and consistent. The unfortunate part is that it shakes apart at speed if you don&#x27;t do both of those things.<p>People make a lot of hay about the NestJS dependency injection system, and my intuition is that a lot of it is that it&#x27;s a novel concept to a lot of the folks running into it. If you come from a Spring or related background, however, I think it&#x27;s pretty clear that NestJS has a pretty critical misunderstanding of dependency injection. Modules are hardwired together--`BarModule` requires `FooModule`rather than just declaring what they <i>need<\/i> and what they <i>export<\/i> and allowing the dependency resolver to figure it out regardless of what module they come from. As-is, you cannot replace a dependency coming from `FooModule` with one, say, from `Foo2Module` without changing <i>every consumer<\/i>. It&#x27;s a high-boilerplate devolved service locator rather than dependency injection.<p>&quot;Pretty critical misunderstanding&quot; has become my default description of big parts of NestJS as I&#x27;ve gotten deeper into its use over the last year and a half. This description really does fit a lot of aspects of the system. It often feels as though the implementors read half a description of this or that, decided &quot;that&#x27;s a great idea!&quot;, and then implemented that half-a-description...poorly. The &quot;microservices&quot; concept (really just RPC, and not particularly play-nice-with-others RPC) is a good example, as is the really clunky access to WebSockets. CQRS is another prime example, as they&#x27;ve somehow implemented <i>single-node CQRS<\/i>, made it impossible to distribute, and declared victory and went home.<p>It is better to <i>not provide official support<\/i> for something if that official support is going to be so full-stop awful, because that official support will choke out attempts to innovate in the space because you&#x27;ve already taken the mindshare for the problem at hand. Which dovetails into the problem that will probably end up putting NestJS in the dustbin as soon as somebody else comes up with a competitor: the NestJS team seems to have what feels like at best an oblivious and at worst a rivalrous relationship with their community and with Node as a whole. Over the last year they&#x27;ve rolled out what read to me as lock-in, don&#x27;t-play-nice-with-the-ecosystem-as-a-whole &quot;features&quot;, like their poorly intentioned CLI &quot;monorepo tooling rather than just using lerna for multi-modulestuff like the rest of the world. Also like the future-forecasted &quot;Nest CLI plugins&quot; for things like linting otherwise bonkers misbehaviors[0]. As somebody who&#x27;s written a bunch of open-source modules for NestJS, I consistently get the feeling that Kamil would really prefer it if developers just shut up and took his stuff and made apps (maybe paying him along the way?), rather than building their <i>own<\/i> open-source stuff alongside it. I still have a very bad taste in my mouth from the way that they just stomped on the `nest-schedule` project by added a less-featureful but otherwise identical &quot;cron-like&quot; gizmo to NestJS core without so much as a nod to the community member who wrote the better one before they did. The idea seems to be that NestJS isn&#x27;t a community, it&#x27;s a single-source vendor, and in 2020 that&#x27;s weird to me.<p>I&#x27;ve used a lot of NestJS but I can&#x27;t really countenance using it for new projects, and I can&#x27;t recommend it to others.<p>[0] - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nestjs&#x2F;nest&#x2F;issues&#x2F;3279\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nestjs&#x2F;nest&#x2F;issues&#x2F;3279<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-25 18:16:20"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["nicoburns"],"id":[23301738],"kids":[23301760],"parent":[23300945],"text":["I&#x27;ve been keepig an eye on nest.js for a while now.

Memory is often tied to setting, and being under the influence is part of setting.  Remove the setting and the memories associated with it won&#x27;t surface as often.  (There is a common memory hack used to remember facts which is to envision a room or place you know well and &quot;place&quot; objects in it that correspond to what you want to remember.  When you want to recall the facts you visit your memory room and the objects you&#x27;ve placed in it trigger recall.)  So it seems like removing the &quot;setting&quot; of an addictive substance might also reduce the memories associated with it.  In essence you would lose a part of your life, a piece of the person you were.  That could be a net good thing for some people, but a net bad thing for others.  If I remember correctly science has also shown that people who drink alcohol are more forgiving of others, which implies that people who quit drinking become meaner.  There has been some theorizing that some addictive substances can (at least temporarily until physical side effects become detrimental) improve the creative output of artists.<p>This is all just conjecture on my part, but it does seem possible that there are ramifications to quitting addiction that medical science has not considered yet and which may have an important influence on peoples ability to quit."],"time":["2020-05-25 20:06:34"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["tiborsaas"],"id":[23300503],"kids":[23300701,23301013,23300869,23301662,23301081],"parent":[23300056],"text":["&gt; Would you like to be addiction-free?

It&#x27;s a Flash game called Proximity. Here&#x27;s a review it got on Newgrounds just a few months ago:<p>&quot;Now THIS is a strategy game. Though the rules are simple, and the graphics are even simpler, what matters is the gameplay. And the gameplay here is pure strategy perfection. Every single move is a shrewd calculation of carefully contrived advantage, yet your turns pass at a snappy pace. You can glean the entire board state in little more than a quick glance, yet the board presents a different tactical situation almost every single turn. The very definition of depth of gameplay over breadth of content. Extra Credits would be proud.&quot;<p>I built a sequel and submitted it to Microsoft&#x27;s first Dream Build Play contest and it ended up being a 3rd place finalist, and was playable at their XNAFest in Seattle, where a publishing company saw it, saw that I was local, and brought me in to discuss a possible publishing deal. Halfway into the talk it morphed into a job interview, and I ended up getting a job there, and got to work on a game for Xbox Live Arcade, one Sony PSP game (the only game I worked on with a physical retail copy), and two WiiWare games, so I got to see the publishing process for all three major console manufacturers in a short period of time.<p>During the first year the publisher sent me to GDC (Game Developer&#x27;s Conference) in San Francisco. Microsoft had recently contacted me and asked if I was interested in putting a demo copy of Proximity 2 up on their new Xbox Live Indie Games  service, and I rushed to get a version ready for it, and it was one of 8 games you could try before the service launched, which cumulatively were downloaded over a million times. Because of that, they had it playable on kiosks at GDC the one year I got to attend (I got to watch people playing it on the kiosk, even), and they even included a brief video of it in their Xbox Live Indie Games trailer during their keynote address during that GDC as well, which was awesome.<p>I held off on the actual release though, since I was working for a publisher that was still planning to publish it at some point, after we got past a couple other projects, and because I didn&#x27;t want it to be a conflict of interest. It was pretty neat gig, because I was employee #3 at the company, so I got to go to developers and be treated like an executive, even though I was anything but. The games we released had some bad luck and didn&#x27;t sell very well, though, and the parent company eventually shut down our branch.<p>That was also right in the heart of the Great Recession, and I had previously dropped out of college and still didn&#x27;t have my degree, so I figured I better go back to school. While in school I worked on getting Proximity 2 ported to iPhone, because I thought that was a better opportunity I should try to cash in on, but I didn&#x27;t market it properly and it ended up not doing super well, even though it was a faithful port (just lower resolution). I then backported the additions I made to the mobile version into the Xbox 360 version, added a few more things, and released that, but by that point it was already 2 years after the demo was out there, and everyone had pretty much forgotten about the game. It did okay, but not great.<p>After I finished my Computer Science degree, I took a stab at working for two more small companies, one that made mobile apps and games and another that made Facebook games in Unity, and eventually decided I should get out of the game industry. I&#x27;ve been working in jobs I&#x27;ve been much less passionate about ever since, although my software is used by more people than anything I ever did while working in the game industry (supporting software for a call center of 90 people, and speech applications for major corporations that have been used for about 2.5 million calls at this point).<p>I also started getting into board game design during this time, and eventually got one of my games signed, and another one was just recently announced to be a finalist in what&#x27;s one of the biggest board game design contests in the US, although because of the pandemic they haven&#x27;t been able to do the finals so it&#x27;s been in limbo for several months now on whether I&#x27;ll win (it probably won&#x27;t, but I&#x27;m happy to be a finalist).<p>I also finally decided to resurrect my Proximity 2 game and I&#x27;m trying to bring it back to desktop and eventually mobile and consoles again. Adding support for more players, cleaning up the UI, adding localization support, upscaling graphics to 1080p, mouse support, achievements, and hopefully a single player campaign and online multiplayer (might not make it into the initial release).<p>Doing it on my own time, which is now competing with tons of other ideas I&#x27;ve had since then and a wife and 2 dogs that need me to spend time with them too, so it&#x27;s going a lot slower this time around. Hoping to release something by the end of this year, though.<p>It didn&#x27;t really fit up above, but there&#x27;s been a few other cool things that happened with my Proximity game. Apparently it&#x27;s been used by teachers for their programming classes sometimes, especially A.I. classes, where students are tasked with coming up with an A.I. for the game. I know because on three occasions I&#x27;ve had students hunt me down and ask me for advice for their project.<p>Also, I once bought a book called Advanced ActionScript 3 with Design Patterns published by Adobe Press, and while I wasn&#x27;t mentioned by name, two chapters were on how to build my Proximity game, and using that to teach the Command and Memento patterns.<p>I also got contacted once about making a version for OMGPop&#x27;s game system, which unfortunately fell through (I wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d have the time since I was struggling to get my degree finished that semester anyway), only for me to discover a year later that they ended up creating Draw Something and got so big they were bought by Zynga, so I&#x27;m kind of curious what would have happened to Proximity in that situation.<p>I kinda feel like Proximity could have had a legacy almost on the level of Tetris if I hadn&#x27;t made a bunch of missteps and had properly capitalized on the momentum I had. Oh well. Maybe there&#x27;s a chance for it to come back, still."],"time":["2020-05-26 01:18:21"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["whb07"],"id":[23302789],"kids":{},"parent":[23301399],"text":["Bitcoin"],"time":["2020-05-25 19:00:31"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["seesawtron"],"id":[23306147],"kids":{},"parent":[23301399],"text":["my hot wife"],"time":["2020-05-26 02:02:20"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["fromtheabyss"],"id":[23301873],"kids":[23301973,23302047],"parent":[23301399],"text":["Kylie Jenner&#x27;s net worth is estimated at $1 billion.<p>Working smart &gt; working hard"],"time":["2020-05-25 17:12:34"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["threatofrain"],"id":[23303452],"kids":{},"parent":[23302968],"text":["Ongoing discussion with CEO responding:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23303037\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23303037<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-25 20:25:42"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jorblumesea"],"id":[23303289],"kids":{},"parent":[23302968],"text":["Hiring <i>is<\/i> their business.

Here&#x27;s the full text:<p>There’s no other way to put this--I screwed up badly. On Friday evening, I sent an email to you about a new feature called public Triplebyte profiles. We failed to think through the effects of this feature on our community, and made the profiles default public with an option to opt out. Many of you were rightfully angry. I am truly sorry. As CEO, this is my fault. I made this decision. Effective immediately, we are canceling this feature.\nYou came to us with the goal of landing a great software engineering job. As part of that, you entrusted us with your personal, sensitive information, including both the fact that you are job searching as well as the results of your assessments with us. Launching a profile feature that would automatically make any of that data public betrayed that trust.\nRather than safeguarding the fact that you are or were job searching, we threatened exposure. Current employers might retaliate if they saw that you were job searching. You did not expect that any personal information you’d given us, in the context of a private, secure job search, would be used publicly without your explicit consent. I sincerely apologize. It was my failure.\nSo, what happened? How did I screw this up? I’ve been asking myself this question a bunch over the past 48 hours. I can point to two factors (which by no means excuse the decision). The first was that the profiles as spec’d were an evolution of a feature we already had (Triplebyte Certificates--these are not default public). I failed to see the significance of “default public” in my head. The second factor was the speed we were trying to move at to respond to the COVID recession. We’re a hiring company and hiring is in crisis. The floor has fallen out on parts of our business, and other parts are under unprecedented growth. We&#x27;ve been in a state of churn as we quickly try various things to adapt. But I let myself get caught in this rush and did not look critically enough at the features we were shipping. Inexcusably, I ignored our users’ very real privacy concerns. This was a breach of trust not only in the decision, but in my actual thought process. The circumstances don’t excuse this. The privacy violation should have been obvious to me from the beginning, and the fact that I did not see this coming was a major failure on my part.\nOur mission at Triplebyte has always been to build a background-blind hiring process. I graduated at the height of the financial crisis as most companies were doing layoffs (similar to what many recent-grads are experiencing today). My LinkedIn profile and resume had nothing on them other than the name of a school few people had heard of. I applied to over 100 jobs the summer after I graduated, and I remember just never hearing back. I know that a lot of people are going through the same thing right now. I finally got my first job at a company that had a coding challenge rather than a resume screen. They cared about what I could do, not what was on my resume. This was a foundational insight for me. It&#x27;s still the case today, though, that companies rely primarily on resume screens that don’t pick up what most candidates can actually do--making the hiring problem much worse than it needs to be. This is the problem we&#x27;re trying to fix.\nWe believed that we could do so by building a better Linkedin profile that was focused on your skills, rather than where you went to school, where you worked, or who you knew. I still believe there&#x27;s a need for something like this. But to release it as a default public feature was not just a major mistake, it was a betrayal. I&#x27;m ashamed and I&#x27;m sorry.\nTriplebyte can’t function without the trust of the engineering community. Last Friday I lost a big chunk of that trust. We’re now going to try to earn it back. I’m not sure that’s fully possible, but we have to try. What I will do now is slow down, take a step back, and learn the lessons I need to avoid repeating this.\nI understand that cancelling this feature does not undo the harm. It’s only one necessary step. Please let me know any other concerns or questions that I can answer (replies to this email go to me). I am sorry to all of you for letting you down.\nSincerely,\n-Ammon"],"time":["2020-05-25 19:26:29"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["MintelIE"],"id":[23303212],"kids":[23303514],"parent":[23302968],"text":["<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20200525173210&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastebin.com&#x2F;pt2pwVvQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20200525173210&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastebin....<\/a><p>Pastebin&#x27;s locked behind Cloudflare and it won&#x27;t work if you use Tor Browser (which you should, for everything) so I fetched the link from archive.org.

They have specialized on assembling customized laptops that are guaranteed to work nicely with Linux. They are owned by Schenker. You can think of them as the Linux department of Schenker.<p>I bought a Tuxedo XUX707 almost 4 years ago, which they built to my ridicolous specs: a desktop (!sic) i7-7700, GTX 1060, 32 GB RAM, 2x 2TB SSHD, 17&quot; 4K monitor, 1x HDMI, 2x DP. I need a computer that has the performance of a desktop PC, but that I can take along once in a while if I have to. The cooling of the Tuxedo is superb, the screen is fantastic, sound is good, keyboard is ok, touchpad not so much. This &quot;laptop&quot; is bulky and heavy and makes only 3 hours on the battery and of course it is like this, because the cooling needs space - the CPU alone consumes up to 65 Watts. Who else would build you such an unreasonable device, Linux-ready, with a 4 year warranty (extra option)? I love this beast more than any computer I had before and the price is unbelievably cheap compared to a Dell or Lenovo or a MacBook with similar specs.<p>I run a second 4K monitor connected to one of the 3 video outlets and have currently 16 USB devices connected. I later added a M.2-SSD-drive (there is space for one more).<p>After two years I dropped the computer and the body cracked - not bad, the computer continued to run nicely.<p>After three years the GPU developed issues - random black screen on boot, which disappeared after a couple of restarts. It took me some while to diagnose the problem and make sure that the NVIDIA card was the culprit. I contacted Tuxedo support. They answered within 24 hours, had me run a system report script (which I could inspect before), and sent me the stickers for free mailing of the device to their headquarter. I asked, if I could send the device without HDs and SSDs and they were happy with this and told me, that they make the tests with prepared SSDs of their own. The device was checked, they confirmed a damaged GPU and decided to replace it as guarantee item without costs. I asked them, if they would replace the cracked body parts in the process and that I would pay for this. They agreed. All communications was per email and with fast response times. Just a summary: they agreed to process my device with no storage devices, made no trouble because of the cracked body and quickly deciced to replace a GPU that had random issues. Try this with Apple!<p>It got even better: when the device came back, I put in my storage devices and everything was working perfectly.<p>The body was completely replaced (two parts) for 60,- Euro. No assembly costs.<p>They noticed a Kensington adapter in the housing that I had forgotten about, removed it from the broken part and returned it in a separate bag.<p>I had no idea that the M.2-slot could be connected to a dedicated heat pipe so I never installed a heatpad for it. They found, though - although I had removed all storage devices - from my system report, that I used to have a M.2 device built in (which was not part of the original computer) and put the missing heatpad in place.<p>Finally, obviously because of all the nerdy stickers on my cover, they included a bag with more nerdy stickers and some Linux magazines.<p>The service procedure was not fast: they check the problem at Tuxedos Headquarter in Augsburg, then send it to Schenker in Leipzig for the replacement and assembly, send it back to Augsburg for final quality control before they deliver the device back to the customer. For me this is not a big problem: if the computer is away for more than 24 hours, I have to switch to a backup computer anyway (in this case a Lenovo W520). Tuxedo does not have the size and logistics for super fast service. But the quality of the service, in my experience, was stunning."],"time":["2020-05-25 01:16:20"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jotm"],"id":[23291054],"kids":[23292416,23291069],"parent":[23290813],"text":["I hate myself for saying this, but guys, just get someone to fix up the English around the website.

With my 2012 laptop I&#x27;d just pop out the battery at ~40-70% charge: it takes 4 seconds (I didn&#x27;t need to look or turn it over) and after 5 years of use the battery reported having lost 3% capacity. I don&#x27;t trust that number, that&#x27;s too good to be true with 2012 battery tech, but the runtime from 100%-0% was still about half of what it was originally (and I used the battery daily, either for standby mode between classes or on the train where I would, of course, have a deeper discharge cycle than when near a power source).<p>But compare that to all the plus points that I see that many other reasonably-priced (&lt;1200 euro) laptops don&#x27;t always have:<p>+ No new SSD, a GPU, or Microsoft tax forced on you (as mentioned)<p>+ WiFi 6<p>+ reasonably-priced 16 or 32GB RAM option<p>+ RJ45 connector without needing an adapter<p>+ No Intel<p>+ Big battery<p>+ The up&#x2F;down arrow keys are not shoved into a single (split) key!

That could have worked with C++. However the need for site isolation, performance considerations and hardware vulnerabilities later put an end to it.<p>For example, initially Chromium had no support from isolating iframes from the main document. Everything was in Blink. But isolating iframes required extremely  complex code in the main process to properly forward all DOM events between process. Then that code had to be made asynchronous so web pages could not block main UI.<p>Then OS interfaces to GPU   and it’s architecture rules out having GPU accelerated graphics and decoders in a per-site process. So that must be put in single a GPU process. Surely it is heavy sandboxed. But, as with the recent Networking process, it is still a shared component with very complex C++ code and fat platform libraries in C&#x2F;Objective-C for interfacing with GPU.<p>So at the end the original idea of writing everything in C++ and using sandboxed processes to make memory-safety bugs harmless just does not work. One needs a memory-safe language.<p>The article mentioned various library-based approaches.
