Our entire society has gradually degenerated over the last few decades for a number of constructively interfering reasons:<p>1. We told two+ generations of children that everyone was capable of anything, gave them all awards after every &quot;competition&quot;, and that kind of upbringing makes it difficult to recognize merit.<p>2. We&#x27;ve lowered the bar for standards across education, in an attempt to bring our lowest up, failing to realize that the primary result was bringing our best down. That hurts merit at professional levels especially, where the pipeline effectively shrinks.<p>3. Our media has regressed to the lowest common denominator. The most popular sources of influence in our society are uncredentialed hacks who spread misinformation (&quot;Dr.&quot; Phil, &quot;Dr.&quot; Oz, Oprah, etc). Even our official &quot;news&quot; sources are primarily entertainment venues and are fully editorialized. This makes it extremely difficult for the average person to recognize merit.<p>It&#x27;s like our entire culture has been consumed by charisma, such that incompetence permeates every sector of our economy and society. Things were too easy for too long, and now we face a reckoning - either we fix things or our nation collapses.

Next to it is the large ROM that holds the microcode.&quot;<p>[...]<p>The chip&#x27;s data path consists of 67 horizontal rows, so it seemed pretty clear that the 134 rows in the ROM corresponded to two sets of 67-bit constants. I extracted one set of constants for the odd rows and one for the even rows, but the values didn&#x27;t make any sense. After more thought, I determined that the rows do not alternate but are arranged in a repeating &quot;ABBA&quot; pattern.7 Using this pattern yielded a bunch of recognizable constants, including pi and 1. Bits from those constants are shown in the diagram below. (In this photo, a 1 bit appears as a green stripe, while a 0 bit appears as a red stripe.) In binary, pi is 11.001001... and this value is visible in the upper labeled bits.<p>[...]<p>&quot;The basic idea of CORDIC is to compute tangent and arctangent by breaking down an angle into smaller angles, and rotating a vector by these angles. The trick is that by carefully choosing the smaller angles, each rotation can be computed with efficient shifts and adds instead of trig functions. Specifically, suppose we want to find tan(z). We can break z into a sum of smaller angles: z ˜ {atan(2-1) or 0} + {atan(2-2) or 0} + {atan(2-3) or 0} + ... + {atan(2-16 or 0}. Now, rotating a vector by, say atan(2-2), can be done by multiplying by 2-2 and adding. The key thing is that multiplying by 2-2 is just a fast bit shift. Putting this all together, computing tan(z) can be done by comparing z with the atan constants, and then doing 16 cycles of additions and shifts, which are fast to perform in hardware.13 To make the algorithm work, the atan constants are precomputed and stored in the constant ROM.14<p>[...]<p>Some of the constants (such as pi) are expected, while others (such as log2(3)) are more puzzling.&quot;"],"time":["2020-05-17 05:46:15"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["montenegrohugo"],"id":[23202374],"kids":[23202451,23202843,23202641,23203819,23203121,23202657,23202463,23202554,23204963,23202585,23202616,23207065,23204560,23205963,23208016,23204273,23203970,23202583,23209134,23203227,23203181,23206859,23204635,23203512,23202909,23203203,23203605,23203338,23206082,23206156,23202424],"parent":[23202228],"text":["&gt; the new species has now been given its official name, &#x27;troglomyces twitteri&#x27;<p>Academia always seems so mature and serious from outside, nice to know there can be some lighthearted humor there too :)<p>As an aside, do you guys know any other Latin animal names that may have an &#x27;untraditional&#x27; origin?"],"time":["2020-05-16 12:53:04"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["asimjalis"],"id":[23202558],"kids":[23202565,23202575],"parent":[23202228],"text":["&gt; The photo shared on Twitter of the millipede Cambala by Derek Hennen.

The cognitive load reading code has just skyrocketed. The simple basis of the issue was when the meaning of existing syntax elements being “overloaded”. &amp;, &amp;&amp;, [] in my mind.  It is not complicated or profound reasoning - simple as now you need to decipher more context to understand what is being expressed.  I’ve been materially disappointed to spend 5-10 minutes reading a small bit of unfamiliar code only to learn that what it ultimately expressed was truly trivial.  It just makes you feel like c++ has become like the toxic parts of academics&#x2F;math where everything is expressed in the most complex way possible to establish superiority over others.<p>The comments about debug ability are true. STL sources&#x2F;template stacks are absolutely terrible to work with.  Luckily with the STL though, what 99%+ of the time, the bug is in your usage, so it doesn’t matter much.  To be fair though that is a trade off - I feel like I’m on vacation debugging c# or Python, but that is (almost) an intrinsic benefit of interpreted languages, with the well-known associated costs.  Just templates... the cognitive load of having to understand (simply read) and debug code from an abstract definition introduces significant pain in terms of debug ability and general usability.<p>“C++ is not the STL” - true but c’mon - whatever is built-in mostly defines the stuff that you can be sure is portable, and rely on as a standard practice&#x2F;resource in large projects. Very few sane people want 5 different implementations of a vector or string from god knows where with god knows what bugs.  In the industry for c++, there is serious need for the _option_ to “reinvent the wheel” of standard libs, but it shouldn’t be that this is necessary to achieve baseline performance or usability in common use cases.<p>I am of the same opinion as at least one other below - simplicity of implementation  and readability of language are king in the “real” world.  What’s better than the beauty of a meta-programmed, absolute masterpiece of modern C++ and zero-cost abstractions?  A program that I can understand in 10 minutes two years after it was written, or better yet that can be understood and debugged by 90% of skill levels instead of 10%.<p>This conversation could, and does, go on without end.  My net-net conclusion so far is that modern C++ has done more harm to itself than good because it is trying to be too much. When the creator of the language can’t even keep up with it enough to call himself an expert, it’s a pretty obvious red flag that things have gone off the rails."],"time":["2020-05-16 20:31:52"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Hitton"],"id":[23206423],"kids":[23206438],"parent":[23202120],"text":["I don&#x27;t understand why does he show loop-based version  using 2 for loops instead of using just one.

You can easily see this using, for instance, Apple&#x27;s Bluetooth Explorer tool as part of Xcode developer tools [1] (or any of the bluetooth signal strength tools in the Play &#x2F; App Stores).<p>You don&#x27;t have to rely on DIY tests from the internet though. While they&#x27;re extremely static tests, the Singapore TraceTogether team did some field studies highlighting the significant variability across hardware [2]. Their tests ended in a plea for factory calibration data from hardware manufacturers.<p>The Singapore team has talked about false positives in depth as a major issue (one was someone in a different apartment, because bluetooth goes through walls), which is why they set a hard, low RSSI value to reduce false positives - this means a lot of true positives will be missed too.<p>The key Australian dev revealing significant issues in Australia&#x27;s COVIDSafe app also acknowledged the major limitations of BLE. [3]<p>The problem of course is you have a situation where you cannot determine if a contact is epidemiologically interesting, because accuracy in real-world situations is really down to the 20-30 metres of Bluetooth range, even over longer time-frames.<p>This means you either have a huge caseload for human tracers to sort the signal from the noise (and this relies on the memory of all participants) or you have some kind of automated system (such as amber alerts that the NHS talks about) and the challenge there is that no-one knows if they&#x27;re really interesting epidemiologically, as no-one can tell where each party was in the context.<p>A recent series of talks by bluetooth experts is extremely informative.<p>In one, an expert discusses all the significant sources of error which creates the huge variability you can see in DIY tests at home. [4]<p>There are other great talks in that video, but Jen Watson - who leads a team at MIT engaged in advanced signal processing - delivers a good brief talk of the issues, hoping to use statistical analysis - using detection theory of fluctuating signals to estimate interesting contacts. [5]<p>The takeaway from all this though is that it&#x27;s a hard problem, and in Watson&#x27;s talk she quickly moves on to thinking about additional future capabilities (such as features in upcoming Bluetooth standards) that might help improve the resolution.<p>This does leave us with a large <i>current<\/i> problem though. Tracking apps have been thoroughly oversold with little evidence of usefulness, and in the case of the UK and Australia government authorities have refused to publish the algorithms they are using to determine proximity from an RSSI value and a phone model.<p>There is nothing sensitive about this apart from the fact it may reveal the system is not useful for the stated purposes.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;crushthecurve_&#x2F;status&#x2F;1259113614796939266\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;crushthecurve_&#x2F;status&#x2F;125911361479693926...<\/a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;opentrace-community&#x2F;opentrace-calibration&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;Trial%20Methodologies.md\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;opentrace-community&#x2F;opentrace-calibration...<\/a><p>[3] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;jim_mussared&#x2F;status&#x2F;1255498092239036417\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;jim_mussared&#x2F;status&#x2F;1255498092239036417<\/a><p>[4] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;KgKbllhgESc?t=2991\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;KgKbllhgESc?t=2991<\/a><p>[5] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;KgKbllhgESc?t=3175\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;KgKbllhgESc?t=3175<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-17 03:07:28"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["tucosan"],"id":[23208239],"kids":{},"parent":[23204410],"text":["Does anyone know more about the actual implementation of the app? \nIs it using Google&#x2F;Apple Contact Tracing APIs already?"],"time":["2020-05-17 02:03:09"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["user_50123890"],"id":[23206717],"kids":[23206901,23208556,23206883,23207193],"parent":[23204410],"text":["This reassures the hypothesis that you probably won&#x27;t catch the virus from a brief contact in a grocery store or similar if you keep your distance.<p>Infections happen within families, and spread from one family to another by friends&#x2F;coworkers.

The reason is that filters work due to several mechanisms which dominate at different particle sizes according to a curve:<p>&quot;For very small particles, less than 0.1 µm in diameter, the primary filtration mechanism is diffusion and the filter is very efficient. For particles between approximately 0.1 and 0.4 µm the filter is less efficient as the particles are too large for a great diffusion effect and too small for a large interception effect.

They did not use currency.<p>- The Spanish estimated that Inca warehouses (Qollqa) contained a surplus of food capable of maintaining the empire fed for 10 years.<p>- Their society was structured as a system of self-sufficient family clans (Ayllus).<p>- The Inca road system (Qhapaq Ñan) was possibly the most efficient form of communications infrastructure of its time.<p>- Their aqueducts (Puquios) used wind to pump water.<p>- &quot;Ama sua, ama llulla, ama quella&quot; (&quot;Do not be lazy, do not lie, do not steal&quot;) was the Inca moral code.<p>- They used 2 languages, the commoners language (Runa simi) and the noble language (Qhapaq simi). The family of languages known today as Quechua are the Runa simi language. The Qhapaq simi language is extinct.<p>- They had an accounting system based on knotted strings called Quipus. It is unclear if quipus contained anything other than accounting information.<p>- Most modern potatoes descend from the ones cultivated by the Inca and their predecessors. Potatoes are one of the most efficient crops in terms of land use and nutrition. European population grew substantially after the introduction of the potato, prior to that, the staple crop was wheat.<p>- After Sapa Inca Huayna Capac died, his 2 sons waged a war of succession. The prevailing son, Atahuallpa, initiated a purge the Inca nobility, effectively decapitating the Inca empire. The fall of the Inca empire took place when Pizarro forces encountered Atahuallpa at Cajamarca during a Spiritual retreat that took place after the purge. The event is known as the &quot;Battle&quot; of Cajamarca, although it was more like an ambush since the Inca side was not expecting a battle and were not in fighting gear. The &quot;battle&quot; ended when Atahuallpa was took hostage, an idea that Pizarro took from Hernan Cortes."],"time":["2020-05-16 19:46:28"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["8bitsrule"],"id":[23210095],"kids":{},"parent":[23198051],"text":["Interesting, because what happened to Clovis in N.A. is a big question.

It is a branded, controlled experience designed for shopping. For many teenagers in America, the mall is a default hang out space—or at least was when I was a kid. Second, today you can easily see an ad on your phone before you say hello to your partner or kids, before you go outside, before you use the bathroom.<p>Underpinning these issues is the gnawing feeling, for many people, that we must be _more productive_. Time is money. Space is money. You should be doing something or, if you must do nothing, do nothing so that you can do something more later.
