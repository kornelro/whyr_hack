Some portion of the strength of the correlation seen in the 1000+ patient cases published in preprint studies so far may be due to other causal factors, but the causal evidence so far makes it very unlikely for the full extent of the large effect size seen to all be a fluke.<p>The piece wrote: &quot;A healthy full body exposure to sunlight can generate 25000 IU of vitamin D in one sitting, without getting burned. 2000-4000 IU daily of D3 supplements will also work.&quot;\nNo. People wrongly believing that some sun gives them enough is probably one of the causes of widespread deficiency. From my review, in the &quot;Practical considerations for avoiding D levels that are too low&quot; section:\nThere are several studies showing that even a lot of sun exposure leaves many people with insufficient D levels. For one list of studies see Tsiaras &amp; Weinstock, “Factors influencing vitamin D status” Acta dermato-venereologica, 2011: “Studies in Hawaii (97), South Florida (98), Southern Arizona (99), Brazil (100), rural India (101) and Queensland, Australia (102) found that significant proportions of the study populations had low vitamin D levels despite abundant sun exposure.” For example, in the Hawaiian study, 51% of the 93 young, non-obese adults had D&lt;30ng&#x2F;ml despite 29hr&#x2F;week (&gt;4hr&#x2F;day) in the sun at latitude 21 degrees. The variability in both seasonal sun intensity and daily hours of exposure for any given individual provide yet another reason that testing blood levels would be helpful. These studies show that even those who seem to get a lot of sun exposure should probably supplement if not testing to ensure adequacy.<p>Also, the bullet point summary in this piece fails to point out the history of the RDA being set too low by statistical mistake. (Which I&#x27;ve updated my review to include. The story is crazy---the original data used to set the RDA would have resulting in 8000 IU&#x2F;day if it had been analyzed correctly.)"],"time":["2020-05-29 23:27:03"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mcfly1985"],"id":[23350129],"kids":{},"parent":[23349962],"text":["What does the author mean &quot;the new chloroquine&quot;?

But you didn&#x27;t each the meal. That is, let&#x27;s not confuse the model of experience with experience.<p>Extending that analogy I cannot argue that my life experience is similar, equivalent, or exchangeable with African Americans because I haven&#x27;t lived their experience under, say, American police. Still I am concerned that if this analogy is taken too far, there will arise an insuperable gap that will work against binding each party into the whole we seek or ought to be seeking.<p>Our -- or THE - American Constitution sets forth equality among us all regardless of creed, color, sex, or religion, but when some of us go to the restaurant we aren&#x27;t served or, worse, there&#x27;s no food and no kitchen for us. America is not living up to the goal despite having fine goals. I recall Cornel West saying civil rights was due not because the Blacks wanted a piece of the pie -- a backhanded reference to government handouts for undeserving people -- but because preferential treatment based on color was never part of the deal. There&#x27;s no white guilt at play here anymore than there&#x27;s handouts going on.<p>So, let&#x27;s be clear: violating civil rights is morally, ethically wrong. And all the more when it&#x27;s perpetrated by sections of society that have greater power, money, and institutional agency. And all the more when cops are supposed to hold the line on justice. Justice is the good line: if you&#x27;re on the wrong side, you should have to pay in the criminal or civil penalty. And if you&#x27;re on the right side then all to the good. Either way, then, there&#x27;s no room to take offense.<p>As I understand it the cop with the knee on the throat of a handcuffed black man was finally charged. Well, big deal: it took them long enough to get to the stunningly obvious. I am hoping the FED charges will follow. And then civil charges. There&#x27;s also the issue of the other officers on the scene and whatever games were played by the DA and its affiliates.<p>Hackernews is primarily about technology, tech corporations, and business. However, let&#x27;s over master the lesson so that we realize the ultimate money lesson with plenty of banked savings to boot: money is not the measurement of all things. We can and must insist there&#x27;s equality under the law for each and everyone of us. Let&#x27;s all work to make sure there&#x27;s enforceable norms which is also, beyond income, an important piece of security for us and our families.<p>I have kids; I know why their skin color is like mine. They had no choice in the matter. And for those parents, sisters, or brothers of African Americans who fell into this society, we cannot be using and abusing and violating their rights. Standing by in a dismissive stance --- a Canadian guy who works as a FTE at my&#x2F;our American company said we Americans need to get our ____ together like it wasn&#x27;t his problem too --- is not help.<p>Maybe I cannot eat the menu. But I am not helpless, nor am I apart from this problem. I also have agency.

This is why we spent some time integrating kahan and Neumaier summation algorithms. This post summarises a few things we learned along this journey.<p>We thought Kahan would badly affect the performance since it uses 4x as many operations as the naive approach. However, some comments also suggested we could use prefetch and co-routines to pull the data from RAM to cache in parallel with other CPU instructions. We got phenomenal results thanks to these suggestions, with Kahan sums nearly as fast as the naive approach.<p>A lot of you also asked if we could compare this with Clickhouse.

The notion seems just as absurd today as it did in the 1800s.<p>I attended public high school in rural upstate NY in the 90s and scored a 35 on the ACT when I was 16, without preparing at all. With some amount of studying I had a 1440 on the SAT that same year (1998 or 99) and didn&#x27;t bother taking it again. I&#x27;ve always scored well on these tests, but it never translated into much acclaim or academic success. I smoked weed at lunchtime every single day my junior and senior years of high school, which was the kind of achievement that gets celebrated in those parts. For a while there we all dropped acid on the weekends too, the winters upstate are brutal. Unlike most of my friends, I went to college where I slacked my way through a 2nd rung liberal arts school with a 3.7 in subject (mathematics), graduating in 2005. By 2010 I was in a hurry to leave the miserable customer service&#x2F;QA engineer role I had worked for 3 years at Surveymonkey.com, so I took the GRE. After about a week of half-assed prep in the evening I scored a 790 math 670 verbal 6.0 writing, enough to get me a scholarship for my Masters. Turns out going to school to escape your shitty job isn&#x27;t the best decision, but I didn&#x27;t have a lot of other options. Surveymonkey is worth what, a couple billion today? Well they didn&#x27;t treat me very well back in 2007. In today&#x27;s climate of online outrage I probably could have parlayed that mistreatment into something, I am a protected species afterall (gay).<p>From my perspective, the problem with this whole system is that smart kids are not challenged enough. Everything is too easy in public school, and bad habits are never corrected. There&#x27;s also no role-models to show smart kids that they might go somewhere in life. Upstate New York is in a permanent state of decline, there&#x27;s nothing these kids can look forward to and they have no money to go anywhere else. Depression and doubt, difficult home lives, access to all manner of drugs, child abuse etc. The best results from my high school came from a few Indian immigrant families who sent their daughters off to Harvard and the like. We still got those girls to drink and smoke weed with us though :).<p>There was another local (ie, white) kid in high school who was really smart and smoked lots of weed and got into trouble the same way I did. A real math talent. We took a double period of AP physics together right after lunch, so we were both high as hell in the back of the classroom. We both scored 5&#x27;s on the test at the end of the year, too. He is a seasonal worker now, puts up tents for country fairs and the like during the summer.<p>The alcoholism in upstate New York is something people out in polite society would not believe. Lots of DUIs in my old friend group. These guys are conscious when they blow a .4 (or higher) on the breathalyzer. One ex-marine friend is a fire jumper (seasonal as well) and went to the hospital with a .6! He was joking with the doctor while they were pumping his stomach, a real character. No small number of these kids are dead.<p>I guess what I&#x27;m trying to say is, ain&#x27;t nothing new under the sun."],"time":["2020-05-30 02:05:07"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["liam36635"],"id":[23362099],"kids":{},"parent":[23356554],"text":["Saw students like me recommending some professional and texting them for grade changes.\nIn my situation, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a life changing experience because I actually spoke with them and they explained all the process involved in accessing your school portal and making the required changes you instructed them..

This is widely expected, probably correctly, to trigger a chain reaction, whereby one US university after the next will abandon standardized tests<p>You&#x27;re really missing the point of this action. Since the College Admissions scandal, it has become clear that people with deep pockets can game the SATs and ACTs by paying people with inside knowledge. The UofC doesn&#x27;t want to eliminate standardized testing, they declared they want a replacement. They are changing this because it is unfairly skewed toward people who can pay up.<p>Trump and the corruption and anticompetitiveness that he represents is a long line of Conservatism that up-ticked during Reagan&#x27;s era. Yes, that is certainly a threat to America, and something to worry about.<p>Conservatives want it all, and they want it concentrated in the fewest hands possible. They are the scorpion on the back of the frog which is Capitalism. Capitalism is free-enterprise, the opportunity for people to create wealth by creating things that benefit society. Conservatives want to twist the rules, to cheat the system, so that you don&#x27;t have the opportunity, so that the rules heavily favor the people who already have it. Why? Because Conservatives stand for no-change, keep the wealth in the hands of people who were born into it. And concentrate it into their hands even more.<p>Conservatism is the opposite of what created the USA and made it special, it is the opposite of what made the USA an economic powerhouse. Conservatism is the default that most countries are governed by, since the beginning of time, across all geographies. Conservatism is the reason why innovation and brilliant creativism is sidelined. Because incumbent power brokers don&#x27;t need it, they don&#x27;t need change, they don&#x27;t need improvements. They just need all the gains to continue going to a very few, and all they need for that is the maintenance of exploitation. Occasionally throughout history Conservatism has been broken by special laws the created fairness. In Ancient Greece it was the Solonian Constitution. In Ancient Rome it was The Law Of Twelve Tables. In 1707 Britain it was Parliament which broke Royal Monopolies and led to the Industrial Revolution. At the founding of the USA it was the Constitution. In all these cases, these laws of fairness drove massive levels of economic growth, of creative destruction and innovation, that changed the world.<p>The Conservatives want to destroy that, because they want it all for themselves, no matter what the consequences. The Roman Emperors destroyed their equitable laws, and that lead to the decline of Rome. Now massive corporations, their heads, and their political stooges&#x2F;lackeys want to destroy equitable economic laws, they want to destroy antitrust legislation that prevents them from controlling it all forever. The momentum that big companies are building to destroy competition and fairness in this country is an existential threat to what makes the USA special. Citizens United. Unfettered mergers and acquisitions. Widespread corporate surveillance using data snooping. All these are of great concern."],"time":["2020-05-30 01:49:05"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["api"],"id":[23356924],"kids":[23356980,23357077,23357234],"parent":[23356554],"text":["His first point is valid.

Some things might not be straightforward like using Shift + [keys] for shortcuts etc.\n- Easier recording mode (like the ability to open a new empty audio project)\n- Multitrack mode, for more channels!\n- play a bit more with the concept of having different windows that can be in different screens (check out the frequency analyzer under &quot;view&quot;)<p>To answer a few questions, I plan to have a very open license this is just a fun side project for me. but I need to figure out the licenses of some libs I am using first (eg wavesurfer, lzma-wasm) and do proper attribution!<p>Thanks again!<p>PS.

Now that this is finally sunsetting, I feel a bit more comfortable writing some things I &#x27;ve learnt today!<p>- First of all, I am amazed at the suggestions and love this is getting. I have been dog fooding it by using it to quickly edit foley audio from a tascam hand-microphone device, in order to make some cheap sound effects for a game project I am working on. The point is, I thought I was aware of all bugs, and all areas of improvement, and I am humbled to have my mind opened and see how valuable outside perspectives are! It&#x27;s so easy get tunnel vision and think you know best I guess.<p>- Secondly... as I said I wrote this in June 2018, and just... kept it... I guess I was afraid of sharing it to the world, perhaps the audio people would get mad at me for making mistakes with the audio api (like the fade in&#x2F;fade out being linear). Perhaps the javascript people would make fun of me for just using Vanilla JS.<p>But if this is impressive in 2020, imagine how impressive it would have been back in 2018! So I guess my point is. Share your work! Do not be afraid to put it out there!<p>- If anyone is interested on how it is built, and how the interface complexities are managed, even though it is just plain old school JS that has the reputation of being notoriously difficult to maintain, I would be happy to make a write-up shortly, or perhaps give a talk on it.<p>- Third... (hopefully that is ok). If you like AudioMass, and like the way it is built and it performs, perhaps you might enjoy working together with me. We are doing cutting edge computer vision, and well.. some CRUD stuff too! My company is hiring (info in my profile). But please be advised that due to covid-19 things may take longer or may not be fully up to date.<p>PS. As for license, I will probably choose something like &quot;wtfpl.net&quot;. if it can help you learn something, or build something, go ahead! If you noticed, the page doesn&#x27;t have any tracking (I realy don&#x27;t know how many visitors came (I also disabled nginx logs)). And of course no ads at all.

Here is what I&#x27;ve learned over the years:<p>People keep repeating that you should work on ideas that solve problems that you have yourself. Now given some time on your own, it&#x27;s natural to start looking at your problems and seeing how to solve them for yourself and potentially others and make a profit along the way. If you want a sinister spin on this, nothing sells better than fear or hope.<p>But this is HN and as far as tech people go, our instinct is to solve problems that are given to us. And often when we have problems on our own, we come up with a solution and don&#x27;t really think about it twice. I was recently talking with someone about a project they had at their work and how their company paid something like 3 million euros to another company to build a &quot;platform&quot; for them. And given that their company isn&#x27;t that large or doesn&#x27;t have that many users (say 40k&#x2F;month tops), that raised my eyebrow a bit. So I asked them to show me what that &quot;platform&quot; was. Long story-short, a website with a username and password registration, email verification, paypal subscription, which allows you to download a list of PDF&#x27;s.<p>To a developer the whole concept sounds like a joke - anyone with a few months of experience can mash that up in two weeks. &quot;Oh but we have so many users and traffic, it&#x27;s not that simple.&quot;<p>Bruh... 40k users&#x2F;month, 100 pdf&#x27;s, ~2mb each is something a raspberry pi can serve without any issues.<p>The truth is, most tech people are very much detached from reality(granted that the mass of people is the reality and not the other way around). We try to fix problems which we really don&#x27;t have ourselves and we over-engineer the crap out of them. And commonly this is the result of the so called &quot;idea generation&quot;. It&#x27;s easy to create a startup that solves a niche problem. But we often fail to acknowledge how tiny these niches really are. It&#x27;s easier to sell something that costs 10000 euros to 10 people and make 100k as opposed to selling something for 5 euros to 20000 people.<p>The truth is, most people create 5 euro products which have a potential audience of 10 people, hence the reason why they make 50 euros as opposed to 100k. You can scroll through PH for days and keep repeating &quot;omg, who needs this?!?!?&quot;<p>I know I have. And truthfully I doubt many people have hit the 50 euro mark, not to mention the 100k.<p>But people make that mistake all the time. We are surrounded by people who will hook up an led to an arduino which will blink when someone mentions them on slack while they are watching a movie, while ordinary people are looking at a website which has payments and they think that&#x27;s quantum physics. Tech people and ordinary people live in parallel universes at this point. The ideas we come up with are solutions to problems no one has. That&#x27;s the reason why SaaS is proving to be a lot more successful strategy than B2C.<p>My take on this is that every time you come up with an idea, don&#x27;t bother sharing it with your tech friends first. In most cases you will get a 50-50 positive-negative response. Find people who are completely detached from your world and have no idea what the difference between a USB and RJ45 is.<p>1. Can you explain your idea in 4 sentences or less?<p>2. Do they understand it?<p>3. Do they have that problem?<p>3a(if Y on 3).

Okay:  Setup a <i>software as a service<\/i> Web site to solve quickly all  traveling salesman problems with fewer than, say, 1 million cities, and everything equivalent in computational complexity to them.<p>First difficulty:  To write the server side software, basically are asking for an algorithm that shows that P = NP, and now we have had some decades to conclude that so far no one knows how to do that (with a <i>von Neumann<\/i> computer, but maybe could get a solution using a quantum computer).<p>Well, for positive integer n &lt;= 1 million, consider the traveling salesman problem on n cities.  Without loss of generality, assume that n is a prime number (with factors only 1 and n).  Then embed this problem in ..., and notice that ..., and then apply ..., exploiting special case ...!  Right!!!<p>Lesson 1:  This idea was super easy to find!<p>Lesson 2:  What it takes to make this idea work is something new, and, if we get a solution, that would contradict the observation that there are no good new ideas because all the good ideas were thought of long ago.<p>Lesson 3:  Finding an algorithm that shows that P = NP is challenging, but with that algorithm would have one heck of a strong <i>technological barrier to entry<\/i> and a contradiction to the claim that it is easy to copy a startup!<p>My real point:  Have two lists.  List A has the problems that plenty of people would pay big bucks to have solved.  List B has the tools for solving problems.  Pick a pair from lists A and B where the tool from B solves the problem from A.<p>Next, if there is no suitable tool in list B, then do some research and find one.  If can&#x27;t find a tool for the problem from A, then pick another problem from A and try again to do the research to find the needed tool.<p>The research need not be as challenging as proving that P = NP.  But broadly one way to find &quot;good ideas&quot; is do some research that yields a tool that enables solving a problem from list A that has been sitting there for a long time unsolved due to the lack of a suitable tool from list B.<p>That is, one way to find a &quot;good idea&quot; is to do some research.<p>If we are restricting to having von Neumann computers do the data manipulations, then we can notice that the manipulations are necessarily mathematically something so that an enabling tool and the research are about forced to be in applied math.<p>It might also be sufficient to use some of the math on the shelves of the research libraries, math that so far has been neglected by the information startup culture.<p>Possible <i>psychological<\/i> issue:  It may be that we frequently see good problems to solve but right away, within a few seconds, implicitly, maybe even unconsciously, reject solving the problem as a startup idea because we don&#x27;t see a suitable tool for a solution.

One aspect that I often see overlooked is the relationship between managers and direct reports.  Managers use the ‘ass in chair’ as a proxy for work load.  What time did you arrive, what time are you leaving, how often are you in and out of your chair?  Rightly or wrongly, the 40 hour work week is only flexible in only one direction.  If you improve your ability to complete your job duties, new job duties magically appear.  To that end, it’s allowed the average manager to ‘outsource’ direct management.  I’m curious how this relationship will change and I’m hoping the 40 hour work week will change with it.  The crux of this question is, Why is the average employee not able to control the incremental value of their time?

Agree with most of what&#x27;s written in the post.

What&#x27;s written here is just a <i>consequence<\/i>, and the post goes on to develop it through all its length... but why did the dynamics change in that way? What&#x27;s the underlying reason for the shift?<p>Some comments here in HN mentioned it: internet becoming a marketplace. With both its good and bad side-effects. It&#x27;s an extremely complex issue, but money does completely shape dynamics of current society, and therefore internet too, and it leaves us <i>without spaces that aren&#x27;t conditioned by it<\/i>. At small scale it doesn&#x27;t seem a big problem, or we rationalize it because everyone needs money to survive... But it really shapes the world, and we can&#x27;t simply ignore the ugly sides of it and pretend we can solve it without ever involving the discussion about money and the dynamics it generates.<p>The &quot;magic&quot; the post talks about only needs three ingredients: human curiosity, time (to develop that curiosity), and spaces (to host those humans and their time). Human curiosity and creativity will always exist as long as we don&#x27;t go extinct. About time... well, we can satisfy our basic needs more efficiently than ever... and yet, ironically, we are using the newly freed time to create &quot;more competitive&quot; products that focus on enslaving the potential of our fellow human beings through infinite-scroll addiction, fear of missing out, instant gratification, attention grabbing and other kinds of biases and &quot;bugs&quot; in the human system. And finally spaces. Well, nothing left. If the only accessible spaces require money or work-to-generate-money, you close the circle and can&#x27;t scape the landscape and conditioning I was describing. Even if there are some spaces left, they tend to fell into oblivion against the competition. Too hard to escape, too easy to rationalize.<p>And honestly, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any game-changer discussion about morality standards here. Morals must play a very important part in getting us to start a change (and by us I mean the kind of people that&#x27;s most directly involved in tech, like this HN crowd), but as long as we don&#x27;t try to really disrupt at least some of the dynamics generated by money-profit-survival-motivations, I&#x27;m somewhat skeptical we will be able to move the needle, because efforts will be eaten by the competition even if we never wanted to play under those rules. Let&#x27;s hope I&#x27;m mistaken and it&#x27;s easier to solve."],"time":["2020-05-28 11:44:29"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["stakkur"],"id":[23338691],"kids":{},"parent":[23334463],"text":["Some days, I miss telnet-ing into BBSes."],"time":["2020-05-28 17:49:33"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["peter_d_sherman"],"id":[23341376],"kids":[23341453],"parent":[23334463],"text":["I (as an armchair philosopher, and not a very good one at that), argue that the problem is not the web, nor technology, but Complexity Vs.

Here&#x27;s what went wrong:<p>Robots were created to serve humanity, but over many centuries, many generations, the knowledge of how they were created (and what it took to control them) was lost, as mankind became lazier and lazier, and deferred all work to the robots.<p>The complexity of the robots (and their AI) increased, whereas the knowledge humanity possessed about them decreased.<p>At a certain time, at a certain critical juncture, because of the increasing knowledge asymmetry, creator (humanity) and creation switched roles, and now the creation caused great problems for the creator, who had basically lost the knowledge, (&quot;lost the manual for&quot; &lt;g&gt;), how to control the creation.<p>We see this pattern repeat in a variety of formats, in a variety of historic and present-day contexts; it includes (but is not limited to!): Technology, Religion, Law,  Governments, Social Systems, etc.<p>Basically, all of those things were created to serve man, to serve mankind...<p>And (depending upon where you are in history, or what your knowledge (or lack of knowledge) of them is, in the present day), some of them either will, or at least have the apparency of, the loss of control by their creator -- mankind.<p>Frankenstein, by Mary Shelly, is an allegory of this theme, that is, of a creator that creates something for beneficial purposes, only that with enough time (and&#x2F;or loss of knowledge), the creation turns on the creator...<p>Understood properly, here&#x27;s the reason why all societies eventually fail, and why far in mankind&#x27;s past, there may have been a high-tecnology society (Atlantis?) which was destroyed, because with all of the solutions it brought, it also brought additional problems, such that those could not be controlled, and eventually it was destroyed, or was the cause of its own destruction...<p>The Greek myth of Sisyphus -- is also an allegory for this\nphenomena...

In recent years, I&#x27;ve come to love functions.  But they are both tools that have cases of appropriateness.<p>However, I think a lot of people are looking at classes the wrong way.<p>In this thread, I&#x27;m hearing that classes should encapsulate functionality.  While this is an aspect of classes, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the main use case of a class.<p>A class should represent a <i>type<\/i> of state.  That is, if you create an instance of a state, it should only support the attributes and default properties that are defined for it.  This is mainly for shorthand(there&#x27;s usually a syntax to build instances of classes) and for clear documentation.  At a lower level, the availability of a class construct makes it possible for AST parsing to do interesting things to your OO code, although I don&#x27;t know how common that is outside of JavaScript.  If JavaScript didn&#x27;t support class syntax, it&#x27;d probably be more difficult to implement things like decorators, both in terms of the Babel plugins that support it as well as future native syntax support.  But I digress.<p>The way I see it, a class should be responsible for holding a mostly fixed set of attributes, setting defaults for those attributes, and have properties that compute off other properties.<p>What doesn&#x27;t belong in a class are methods that do complex things with other objects and class instances.  If your method does something complicated that affects outside state, it&#x27;s time to extract it to a function that takes a context argument.  This makes it easy to test your function without necessarily having to meet all the requirements of the classes you&#x27;d be using with it, and it makes the code more flexible because you can use it for other contexts besides a single class. <i>(I know that you can use inheritance and composition to kind of do the same thing, but I think this sucks because inheritance introduces problems and composition just adds more code than just importing a function where you actually need to use it.)<\/i><p>More concisely, a class shouldn&#x27;t be looked at as a module, or a set of related functions that do complex things, especially when not all of those functions rely on a state.

Say a plate breaks in your kitchen.  What happened? Obviously some kind of an object derived from a circle and and and some sort of factory? And, uh.  Josh you mentioned broken plates.  So, as far as a broken plate, I think we can address this by adding some methods for how many pieces the plate is currently in and which broken piece we&#x27;re talking about then we can specify each broken piece as a simple polygon from the origin of the virtual object, that being the theoretical still-intact plate as manufactured.  We can also specify each plate in terms of the deviations from the platonic ideal plate as specified in the CAD designs.  So let&#x27;s change all the signatures to refer to EITHER 1 whole piece, being the whole plate, or the first broken piece, second broken piece and so on, which can all end up in different places in the world.  Ultimately this will cover just about everything except if someone makes an artisanal plate by gluing together previously broken plates, where they&#x27;re not from the same plate.  That will make garbage collection difficult as the artisanal factory might leak memory if it doesn&#x27;t use every piece.  The solution is to simply do manual garbage collection where we replace each derived plate that is made up of broken plates, with a new plate that is pre-broken, and we just have to set what pieces it is made of, and then the original pieces can be freed.  So actually the base case does need to know whether it is considered &quot;whole&quot; despite being made up of broken pieces, and then it can have virtual pieces that comprise it but know that they have to move and be together as one.  This basically captures the plate abstraction pretty well, as long as you remember that we decided that for the dinner function we decided to set a plate, rather than set a table, so you just do the glass.set() the fork.set() and plate.set() so on, and then you can check that it&#x27;s set, whereas the table they&#x27;re set on might have unrelated items such as a candle, that isn&#x27;t really considered set or not.<p>Javascript: how about we all just use <i>paper plates<\/i>. do whatever you want with them.<p>Programmer: also works!

Apparently this can become a huge problem for developing children if their pallet is under-formed.<p>I think this is a big public health issue, and I think it makes sense to start some kind of large scale public health campaign to inform the public and avoid all of these dental issues.<p>There&#x27;s a book about this, the introduction is online here <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sup.org&#x2F;books&#x2F;extra&#x2F;?id=29626&amp;i=Introduction.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sup.org&#x2F;books&#x2F;extra&#x2F;?id=29626&amp;i=Introduction.htm...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-29 01:14:00"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["bradlys"],"id":[23343593],"kids":[23343747,23343914],"parent":[23335368],"text":["Interesting.
