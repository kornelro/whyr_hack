I think that a federal minimum wage (or at least, a high one), and to some extent, state minimum wages, are a bad idea. The Fight for $15 movement came from expensive cities, and it might be the right policy for those places. But it would severely distort and crush lower-cost cities and states. The right policy for San Francisco isn&#x27;t necessarily right for Birmingham. It&#x27;s one thing to have uniform national laws for human rights.

The existence of a meaningful minimum wage implies that there are people in the society who desire to negotiate for lower compensation (because they are more motivated to get the job for whatever reason), but they are disallowed from doing so.  It might be our opinion that it is undignified or exploitative to work for a certain wage, but we should not have the right to bar others from doing so if they wish.<p>As individuals, we should demand the freedom to negotiate the terms of our employment without government influence, including wages, benefits, and even working conditions.  Using the government to coerce employers into giving greater compensation is appealing in the short term, but ultimately it disenfranchises others by blocking them out of jobs and results in long term economic stagnation.<p>Mandatory minimum wage significantly above the &quot;natural&quot; level dictated by prevailing economic conditions unquestionably causes harm, mostly to workers who, if they choose to continue to work for less money, are now doing so illegally.

You cannot make a man worth a given amount by making it illegal for anyone to offer him anything less. You merely deprive him of the right to earn the amount that his abilities and situation would permit him to earn, while you deprive the community even of the moderate services that he is capable of rendering. In brief, for a low wage you substitute unemployment. You do harm all around, with no comparable compensation.<p>The only exception to this occurs when a group of workers is receiving a wage actually below its market worth. This is likely to happen only in rare and special circumstances or localities where competitive forces do not operate freely or adequately; but nearly all these special cases could be remedied just as effectively, more flexibly and with far less potential harm, by unionization.<p>It may be thought that if the law forces the payment of a higher wage in a given industry, that industry can then charge higher prices for its product, so that the burden of paying the higher wage is merely shifted to consumers. Such shifts, however, are not easily made, nor are the consequences of artificial wage-raising so easily escaped. A higher price for the product may not be possible: it may merely drive consumers to the equivalent imported products or to some substitute. Or, if consumers continue to buy the product of the industry in which wages have been raised, the higher price will cause them to buy less of it. While some workers in the industry may be benefited from the higher wage, therefore, others will be thrown out of employment altogether. On the other hand, if the price of the product is not raised, marginal producers in the industry will be driven out of business; so that reduced production and consequent unemployment will merely be brought about in another way.<p>When such consequences are pointed out, there are those who reply: “Very well; if it is true that the X industry cannot exist except by paying starvation wages, then it will be just as well if the minimum wage puts it out of existence altogether.” But this brave pronouncement overlooks the realities. It overlooks, first of all, that consumers will suffer the loss of that product. It forgets, in the second place, that it is merely condemning the people who worked in that industry to unemployment. And it ignores, finally, that bad as were the wages paid in the X industry, they were the best among all the alternatives that seemed open to the workers in that industry; otherwise the workers would have gone into another. If, therefore, the X industry is driven out of existence by a minimum wage law, then the workers previously employed in that industry will be forced to turn to alternative courses that seemed less attractive to them in the first place. Their competition for jobs will drive down the pay offered even in these alternative occupations. There is no escape from the conclusion that the minimum wage will increase unemployment.&quot;<p>[...]<p>&quot;As to the prices, wages and profits that should determine the distribution of that product, the best prices are not the highest prices, but the prices that encourage the largest volume of production and the largest volume of sales. The best wage rates for labor are not the highest wage rates, but the wage rates that permit full production, full employment and the largest sustained payrolls. The best profits, from the standpoint not only of industry but of labor, are not the lowest profits, but the profits that encourage most people to become employers or to provide more employment than before.&quot;<p>Henry Hazlitt “Economics in One Lesson.”<p>To those who are downvoting: There are no illegal people, there is no illegal two-party consensual trade."],"time":["2020-08-19 22:40:36"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["huntermeyer"],"id":[24218110],"kids":{},"parent":[24213325],"text":["Non-paywall link:\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20200819180537&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.economist.com&#x2F;schools-brief&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;15&#x2F;what-harm-do-minimum-wages-do\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20200819180537&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.econo...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-08-20 01:34:08"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["dalbasal"],"id":[24221619],"kids":{},"parent":[24213325],"text":["There was a debate between the pro &amp; con side of minimum wages a few years back.

Obviously, a $1,000ph minimum wage <i>would<\/i> increase unemployment. That&#x27;s hard to argue against. Why is a $14 minimum wage different? Where&#x27;s <i>your<\/i> theory.

The gap between theory and practice can be vast, often is. Keynes (and most of his generation) was famously wrong about the future of working hours. Even so, the theories (income effect &amp; substitution effect) used to make this failed prediction were not discarded. Even today, college economists teach the theories and Keyne&#x27;s prediction. They find a way where the theories are still right, but &quot;below the noise threshold.&quot; IE, other factors just happened to be more important in this case.<p>I would also point out the the intellectual founders of modern, liberal free market theories (Hayek, Coase, Popper kinda) emphasized this. Economics is not a science.<p>There is no universally true answer to the question &quot;<i>increases unemployment among young and low-skilled workers?<\/i>&quot; There are theoretically true answer, but this may or may not be operative in practice. It&#x27;s also true that food availability increases reproduction rates. This doesn&#x27;t mean that adding more burger joints will increase the human population of Manhattan.<p>In Portugal, youth unemployment rates often tend to be high.

Africa).<p>What would the middle east look like if the Mosaddegh government had continued? No revolution, No Ayatollah, no Iran-Iraq war, no Hezbollah? Instead we got the Shah who forced his people to modernize, secret police pulling veils off women was common and generally unleashed a reign that was anathema to most of the conservative population outside Tehran.

Going further back, the Zoroastrians, who fled the Islamic conquest and arrived in India more than a millennia ago are the richest, most educated and economically successful minority group by an order of magnitude, or two.<p>The Shah&#x27;s reign lasted 25 years.

Here is my investment thesis:<p>In a nutshell my belief is that Apple will have a few quarters of declining revenue and that is going to torpedo their market cap.<p>* Apple is 100% reliant on selling new hardware, whatever push into subscriptions they are trying to do is going to fail or take ages to catch on. The reason for this is that Apple sells primarily to consumers, so the subscription needs to be a consumer subscription. What could that be? $30 a month for Apple Music + Apple TV + Apple Fitness + Apple Photo Storage? I suppose this is possible but I don&#x27;t see people switching away from Netflix, HBO, or Spotify so easily. Spotify is likely the most at risk. This strategy is possible but I think the timeframe is going to take longer than people expect.<p>* We are close to reaching the end of phone innovation. The things on the horizon that could possibly drive continued revenue are: smaller iPhones, folding iPhones, planned obsolescence, and from the software side a merge of iOS&#x2F;iPad OS such that you can use your iPhone 15sMAX-SE with a USB-c monitor as your computer. This is possible but say in 2021 apple releases a 4&quot; folding to 8&quot; iPhone with USB-C out to an external monitor that would fly off the shelves. However that is basically the logical end-point of smartphones and after that Apple is going to have a hard time selling anything new until AR glasses arrive.<p>In a nutshell Apple needs a subscription model to sustain this valuation, and without obsolescence essentially being a forced subscription (you rent your 1000 iphone for 4 years and then chuck it as worthless) I&#x27;m not sure they will find success.<p>The planned obsolescence thing is a real revenue driver for Apple though and without some antitrust lawsuit maybe they can maintain that for a long time. My bet is that 2 quarters from now they miss earnings and the valuation blows up."],"time":["2020-08-19 20:28:16"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["woranl"],"id":[24211846],"kids":[24212035],"parent":[24210991],"text":["Back in 1997, Michael Dell famously said that if he were put in charge of Apple, &quot;I&#x27;d shut it down and give the money back to the shareholders.&quot;<p>Good that Apple didn’t hire you then.<p>Where is Dell now?"],"time":["2020-08-19 18:00:28"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["nonfamous"],"id":[24213566],"kids":{},"parent":[24210991],"text":["233 comments in this thread as of this writing.

Great to see the paper submitted and discussed :-)<p>Sorry for being a bit late to the discussion, I will try to answer the questions in detail that were asked below.<p>I want to clarify one misunderstanding that seems to come up several times, namely the distinction between &quot;host security&quot; and &quot;security of the WebAssembly program itself&quot;. WebAssembly <i>does<\/i> have measures and a good design for host security. E.g., in the browser, WebAssembly programs are run in a sandbox (just as JavaScript is), and writes inside WebAssembly&#x27;s linear memory should never affect values outside of linear memory (e.g., VMs insert bounds checks when reading&#x2F;writing from&#x2F;to WebAssembly pointers). Those techniques protect against <i>malicious<\/i> WebAssembly binaries, which is of course important in the Web.<p>Here, we look at a different side of WebAssembly&#x27;s security story: What if the WebAssembly binary is <i>vulnerable<\/i> and gets fed malicious input? In this attacker model, we can at most do what the host environment allows us to do. But especially for large WebAssembly programs with lots of imports, or WebAssembly binaries for standalone VMs (outside of the browser, without a tried-and-tested sandbox), this can still be a lot of attacker capability! And when we look into the protections <i>inside<\/i> WebAssembly&#x27;s linear memory (not between linear memory and host memory), we find that there are very little. All linear memory is always writable, no stack canaries, no guard pages, no ASLR, no safe unlinking in smaller allocators etc. This is worrying as more code gets linked together into a single WebAssembly binary.<p>If you have any further questions, I am more than happy to answer, here and also via email.

I&#x27;ve been thinking about mind-mapping for decades.<p>My breaking point: I have DropBox folders for 1770 math papers, that I periodically read on computers and tablets. The significance of most of these papers is lost to me. I want to be able to browse this collection in a &quot;supermarket shelf&quot; topology. Most of creatitivity is not planned; planning tends to stifle creativity. Rather, a frenetic mind is fortunate enough, after months of fruitless wanderings, to encounter the right set of ideas in close enough proximity to notice. For example, a PCB protoboard has the correct 0.1&quot; spacing to guide a router jig for making a pasta guitar. Who knew?!<p>Ideally one traverses a private web site with links to every asset. The associations need to be both manual and automated, logical and accidental. For example, time of creation or visits is critical data for determining proximity. Looking at each PDF in plain text to attempt to infer proximity would be a great application of deep learning tools, leveraging existing proximities as training data.<p>On a larger scale I have repeatedly urged the American Mathemetical Society to open up its MathSciNet cash cow to be a premier playground for machine learning. Unlike computer science, mathematics does have a detailed index of all published research, through the efforts of many volunteer reviewers. However, math is crippled by many archaic beliefs: That ideas are organized by fields such as number theory, and there is a single global worldview specifying this organization. That the value of MathSciNet is its hand-curated organization. I believe that we&#x27;re crippling a generation of mathematical progress by not allowing mathematics to be at the forefront of mind mapping efforts, with many competing voices&#x2F;tools describing its organization and facilitating idea browsing. Autocomplete is still at the &quot;pager&quot; stage of development, with &quot;smart phones&quot; yet to come. We could all benefit from the cloud autocompleting each of our mind-maps. Mathematics is a relatively small, constrained domain where shared mind-mapping and autocomplete could first flourish.<p>I&#x27;ve separately used a text file as scratch paper many days for the last fifteen years, saving every file. I can retrieve much useful information through full text search. I am reminded however of Don Knuth&#x27;s adage &quot;Premature optimization is the root of all evil,&quot; and the smaller optimization problem of how to best organize physical receipts. Excessive organization is wasted effort and a form of neurosis. I scan lots of documents but not every receipt; they all go in boxes dated by quarter, vacuum packed after a year. When I really need a receipt I can find it, but the effort to file has been properly balanced with the effort to retrieve. Same with text files; full text search works. It would be a mistake for me to put more effort into the structure of these files. Rather, through scripts and AI tools, I can evolve an indexing exoskeleton around these existing unstructured raw materials.<p>I need mind-mapping to manage assets, not to create a private web site of my thoughts. And there cannot be a user&#x2F;programmer dichotomy; we each need to script additional associations into our mind maps. That belongs in exoskeleton, not cluttering up primary text."],"time":["2020-08-19 19:22:02"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["senectus1"],"id":[24207327],"kids":[24207340,24207596],"parent":[24206727],"text":["HN hug o death.<p>anyone got a link to what this &quot;obsidian&quot; is?"],"time":["2020-08-19 07:09:49"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["missedthecue"],"id":[24213137],"kids":[24214232,24214554,24213825,24213443,24215797,24215932,24216312,24217258,24220582,24214762,24214532,24215530,24217934,24214007,24214018,24234766,24214311,24216200,24214037,24220191,24214576,24218326,24214212,24214130,24213888,24214182,24214401,24213677],"parent":[24212628],"text":["These studies don&#x27;t really prove anything.<p>Common arguments in favor of these studies -<p><i>&quot;They prove people don&#x27;t quit work on UBI!&quot;<\/i><p>- No, they prove that people who are in a program that is very clearly temporary will not end their careers for a short pilot program.

At that point, I contacted my host, and they explained that the WordPress component of the Shortcuts app was, for some reason, bombarding the server with a whole lot of requests for files that didn’t exist. The server thought it was under attack and blocked my whole network. Then it got interesting: the guy said that the server was throwing 418s.<p>I thought he might be mistaken at first.

It also requires you to be able to visualize shapes well, and to develop a good aesthetic sense. These things are for the most part nonverbal, and require a long time to master. When I&#x27;m drawing, I&#x27;m not really thinking as explicitly about what I&#x27;m trying to do as when I&#x27;m programming.

Someone who sits down at the piano occasionally would likely say that they find the instrument difficult, or that they&#x27;re &quot;no good at piano&quot;. The difference from my perspective is that culturally we tend to accept that most people can become reasonably proficient at the piano with practice (even without innate musical ability). Playing the piano is a mechanical process. You hit the right notes at the right times, and it works. The same people that accept the piano as something learnable often think drawing is something you have to be innately good at, and I don&#x27;t think this is true at all. Almost everyone has the necessary muscle control (if you&#x27;re using the right parts of your hand&#x2F;arm). If that weren&#x27;t the case, people would not be good at tracing over images and rendering them true to the original. Once you accept that fact, the other primary requirement is building up objects from primitives. You can render a human standing in almost any posture just using ovals, rectangles, trapezoids, etc. The point I&#x27;m trying to make is that drawing is a learned skill, and almost anyone can draw whatever they want if they practice properly and consistently (focus on drawing ONE thing well before you move on to the next). It&#x27;s not magical, and it doesn&#x27;t require some innate talent to reach an acceptable level of competency.

Then you compose with a goal in mind and observe very open, patiently and detailed while you make suggestive visual marks such that some details will work together to form a whole unity, and the whole supports the natural detailed variety. Playfully arranging paths for the eye of the viewer, such that while it travels over the drawing the perception meeting the viewers inner mental model of the world triggers an emotional response. Each of these things can be trained, and even non gifted can achieve reasonable results. You can use simplest tools and as long as human brains do no change too much they can relate to drawings which are 2000 years old.<p>For coding you must know how a program statement works, how hardware and virtual resources are working and ideally have a systematic analytical approach to construct and to define, identify and resolve misbehaviors. Have a mental goal how all peaces should work together, how they form a rigid stable architecture of unity, while also allowing a variety in further desirable transformations. Envision all possible desirable state and machine changes during runtime and later system extension and avoiding unwanted ones. At this point it leaves the right&#x2F;wrong world view. Cutting an architecture out of the solution space of all possibilities, growing from bare bones, little peaces to a complete system. Each of these things can be trained, and even non gifted can achieve reasonable results.<p>While we can learn from good drawings it is not so easy to learn from good programming examples.<p>The problem with code is that while we are often working with same principles like imperative functions and stack machines since 50 years, the technical application environment is still constantly scaling up and while it is conceptually never new it keeps working only during short periods, so no long term solution are envisioned. Further more the result is not open to an easy perception or naive judgement (besides app rating maybe) and the result is often unlinked to the creator. An envisioned whole system is no longer needed as we have monopolized systems, wich updates we all follow frightened to &#x27;reduce&#x27; risk. Resources like memory are scaled up without limits, the number of programmers rises and we are told to work in teams achieving very well paid very mediocre short living results. So the art of coding is on decline and while the &#x27;management&#x27; of churning out buttons on &#x27;app&#x27; screens, pasting stuff and fiddling in frameworks called consulting is on the rise. In absolute numbers maybe good programming examples where never as easy accessible as today, but is often buried below all the noise and not very rewarded. Probably the result of the economical success of the applied art of coding.<p>So for an coding artist fiddling with a pencil and paper to make something out of nothing can be again very rewarding... or maybe fiddling with vi and compilers etc. :-D"],"time":["2020-08-20 10:27:11"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["xomodo"],"id":[24209211],"kids":[24209672,24209652],"parent":[24186410],"text":["For accessing aws ec2 instances behind nat&#x2F;fw add this lines ~&#x2F;.ssh&#x2F;config:<p><pre><code>  Host i-* mi-*\n   ProxyCommand sh -c &quot;aws ssm start-session --target %h --document-name AWS-StartSSHSession --parameters &#x27;portNumber=%p&#x27;&quot;\n   UserKnownHostsFile &#x2F;dev&#x2F;null\n   StrictHostKeyChecking no\n   User ubuntu\n   LogLevel ERROR\n   DynamicForward 5060\n<\/code><\/pre>\nUsage: `ssh -i key.pem i-0xxxxxxxxxx`.

If you think tx A appeared before B, that&#x27;s not necessarily the order a particular miner saw them. The whole point of the mining is to agree on order.<p>2. That said, a minute or two difference is pretty universally visible, so it&#x27;s reasonable to ask to prioritize the first-seen transaction. However, from the user&#x27;s perspective, transaction is going to be confirmed within tens of minutes, or even an hour or two, so a shorter difference in time between your transaction and mine is no more important than ordinary variance in block times.<p>3. When the mempool is full, the entirely &quot;capitalistic&quot; relay logic exhibits some &quot;socialistic&quot; properties: a newly coming transaction has to cover for the lowest-paying transaction that is going to be kicked out. This is a necessary anti-DoS measure to prevent flooding the network cheaply with transactions that kick each other out and most of them end up non-mined with disproportionally low cost of mining the rest. In other words &quot;if you kick out a tx, you have to pay for it, because it was previously relayed&quot;. This means that later coming, higher-paying transactions can&#x27;t just take a seat paying marginally higher fee. That margin is going to continuously escalate as the mempool is being overloaded, better protecting transactions that were already relayed.<p>4. Finally, mining is very competitive. If you don&#x27;t prioritize by feerate, another miner will and their extra profit would allow for capturing higher percentage of the hashrate while growing difficulty makes it even more expensive for everyone else. Any sort of agreement that undermines everyone&#x27;s profits in the name of fairness requires (1) establishing a consensus in the first place, and (2) keeping it relatively static so random outsiders don&#x27;t undercut it. But then such organization can use its leverage against outsiders in order to do many more things: censor transactions and change rules. That&#x27;s why Bitcoin works the way it is: so anyone can join and mine without permission, funded by leftover profits, so no single miner (or group of miners) has no long-term leverage against everyone else."],"time":["2020-08-19 11:52:07"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ximonn"],"id":[24208393],"kids":[24209654,24208439],"parent":[24196031],"text":["It makes sense to offer a service for transactions which might not get included to offer a paid accelerator:\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pushtx.btc.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pushtx.btc.com&#x2F;<\/a>"],"time":["2020-08-19 10:37:49"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["londons_explore"],"id":[24219103],"kids":{},"parent":[24196031],"text":["I feel this paper doesn&#x27;t consider the possibility that adding or removing a few random transactions to the end of the block is a good way to get many more possible blocks to sha hash and maybe find a winning block..."],"time":["2020-08-20 03:57:48"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["noxer"],"id":[24213041],"kids":{},"parent":[24196031],"text":["Not a single word about how literally all these problems only exist because miners try to suck out as much money as they can.

At the 18-month and 3.5-year visits, toddlers took part in a computer task in which they were trained to search for a red apple amongst a varying number of either blue apples (easy search), or blue apples and red apple slices (difficult search). An eye tracker monitored their gaze and visually rewarded the child when they found the red apple, allowing them to perform the task even though they were too young to verbally describe what they were doing.<p>First off, this is brilliant use of eye tracking.  I could see eye tracking being so useful for learning, such as tracking attention, knowing when to need a break, etc.  Eye tracking is super useful in user testing - for example I was watching some user testing at a major corporation and we used eye tracking.  We instructed the user to minimize the app and then open it again, and we noticed that when it was in the systray, people really got confused.  It was really easy to see because we could see where their eyes were scanning.  Using eye tracking for people who can&#x27;t speak (for any reason, maybe physical or mental injury or disability, and here age &#x2F; language barrier) could be huge.<p>The attention differences are certainly interesting, although I wonder how much of it might be training to use touchscreens, or the idea of a screen that it might change at any time, without related motion.  This is completely unnatural, as you would normally think something will change when something walks over to it, or moves slightly.  Fixed objects tend to fade more into the background of our mental landscape, which is the basis of a lot of sleight of hand.  Like removing something when you can&#x27;t see it.  It&#x27;d be interesting to compare against something that doesn&#x27;t change when you interact with it, like television screens.  (is it the touch part, or the screen part?)<p>I also wonder how touchscreens are sometimes differently interpreted by animals, kind of like mirrors are.  For example, some cats seem to think that the little toy apps are under them, or inside of them, or are just generally confused.

Pharmas separate drug R&amp;D from manufacturing and sales.<p>2. R&amp;D companies submit proposals to the FDA for new drugs they want to develop. The FDA can also send out RFPs for drugs they&#x27;d like to prioritize.<p>3. The FDA chooses drugs based on likely public benefit, rather than the profitability-driven selection we have today.<p>4. The FDA _funds the R&amp;D_ for the drugs it chooses. This allows the R&amp;D company to operate with positive cash flow, separately from the eventual (possible) future income from manufacturing and sales. This is also the incentive for developing drugs that aren&#x27;t patentable, or which will be required only in small quantities.<p>5. When a drug is approved for release, the FDA will license one or more manufacturers to produce it, based on their quality, cost, and scale. This is why the Pharmas break into separate companies. Some may focus only on R&amp;D, some may focus only on manufacturing. Some manufacturers can focus on large-scale high volume production, while others can focus on small-scale production. This prevents the excuse for charging huge prices for rarely-needed drugs &quot;because the equipment needed would otherwise be producing much higher volume drugs at lower cost&quot;.<p>This arm of the FDA would be funded partly by the public, and partly by licensing fees. The math for insurance costs and premiums would change because retails prices for most drugs would drop. That would make insurance cheaper, and some of those savings would probably need to go towards a tax for the FDA&#x27;s R&amp;D funding.

First the main theme is just wrong. It is quite a stretch to say that ruling minimal flat fee schedules illegal led to the billable hour. Flat fees are still legal and many lawyers use them. It is only illegal to have the bar association set minimums.<p>The article is also not quite correct to imply that the billable hour causes more misery than flat fees. If you have flat fees the partner will make the most money by forcing an associate to the largest number of flat fee assignments possible and that would still result in overwork. There are other worse problems with flat fee arrangements. In a flat fee situation you get paid the same regardless of how much work you put in, so there is incentive to finish the task with minimum amount of work. But if you are a perfectionist and&#x2F;or a lawyer that takes pride in his work, you will spend extra time to do the job right when it requires it. And that will make your life extra miserable because the partner expects you to finish a certain number of tasks regardless.<p>So the problem is not billable hours or flat fees, the problem is that the partner makes money from associates labor and wants to squeeze out as much labor as possible. This is an issue in many careers of course, but it is somehow worse in law.<p>And yes, I have worked in top law firms (if you haven&#x27;t noticed by the bitterness) and have worked both for billable hour and for some flat fee arrangements. I much preferred the billable hour stuff. If you are in a top firm you can just assume you will get the more difficult assignments so you shouldn&#x27;t be taking flat fees."],"time":["2020-08-19 06:58:06"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["anonunivgrad"],"id":[24206938],"kids":[24207042,24208029],"parent":[24195595],"text":["Not a good article.

Let&#x27;s look at things from the perspective of pure capitalism...<p>Buyers of legal&#x2F;law&#x2F;lawyer&#x2F;law firm services, specifically the largest buyers (large corporations), typically are run by CEO&#x27;s who have relatively little knowledge of Law.  Oh sure, they might be advised by a Chief Legal Officer &#x2F; General Counsel, but then the question is, why are they outsourcing their &quot;home-team&quot; legal capabilities to large law firms for certain cases?<p>Well, let&#x27;s suppose a corporation was sued for millions, heck, <i>billions<\/i> of dollars (you remember Carl Sagan, right?  &quot;Billions and billions...&quot;?

Oracle America (previously named Oracle America, Inc. v. Google, Inc. in lower courts) is a current legal case within the United States related to the nature of computer code and copyright law. The dispute centers on the use of parts of the Java programming language&#x27;s application programming interfaces (APIs), which are owned by Oracle (through subsidiary, Oracle America, Inc., originating from Sun Microsystems), within early versions of the Android operating system by Google. Google has admitted to using the APIs, and has since transitioned Android to a copyright-unburdened engine, but argues their original use of the APIs was within fair use.<p>Oracle initiated the suit arguing that the APIs were copyrightable, seeking US <i>$8.8 billion<\/i> in damages.&quot;<p>OK, so now let&#x27;s look at things from Google&#x27;s perspective:<p>From Google&#x27;s perspective, $8.8 billion (not million, <i>8.8 billion<\/i>) dollars is on the line.<p>Is that something that should be kept with Google&#x27;s home-team legal department, or outsourced?<p>Think of this like a giant poker game.<p>That is, <i>it might be worth many millions<\/i> (in outsourced legal fees, etc.), <i>if the possibility for loss prevention is in the billions<\/i>.<p>Hey, you&#x27;d spend a few million dollars of your own money, if it could prevent you from losing $8.8 billion of your own money, wouldn&#x27;t you?<p>I would.<p>And I don&#x27;t know anyone else that wouldn&#x27;t.<p>So now enter the &quot;Big Legal&quot; law firm.<p>Big Legal (their sales pitch): &quot;We&#x27;re the top legal firm, we&#x27;ve served the following list of corporate clients (insert impressive-sounding list of corporate clients here), and we have tons of the brightest legal minds, recent graduates of the nation&#x27;s top ivy-league law schools that we poached from other law firms and academia, etc., etc.&quot;<p>Well, from the perspective of the company getting sued, for billions, <i>what&#x27;s not to love<\/i>?<p>It sounds great, it sounds like the solution!<p>It sounds like the best defense possible!<p>With a company like that on your company&#x27;s side, there&#x27;s no way your company could lose!  So how much is all of that going to cost?<p>Big Legal: &quot;Well that&#x27;s the best part of everything!  We&#x27;ll simply let you rent X of our brightest legal minds for Y dollars per hour (billable hours!), where we will take Z% as a percentage (a large percentage!) for the privilege of your company having used (what amounts to!) our <i>legal match-making service<\/i>!<p>You know, it&#x27;s like Fiddler on the Roof: <i>&quot;Match maker, match maker, make me a match, find me a find, catch me a catch!&quot;<\/i>.<p>It&#x27;s like that, except that the Big Legal law firm acts as a matchmaker between the large corporation who is getting sued, with a lot at stake, and the legal minds (AKA recent graduates) that they have poached from some of our nation&#x27;s top ivy-league law schools...<p>Then the partners at the Big Legal law firm -- collect the profits on their matchmaking activities; the difference between the hour billed to the corporation in legal trouble, and the (much lower!) per hour rate they pay their recently-poached legal minds.<p>And thus, the &quot;billable hour&quot; was created -- <i>as yet another form of trickle-down &quot;Voodoo&quot; economics.<\/i> &lt;g&gt;<p>&gt;&quot;Hourly billing also pleased clients, who received a clearer look into the services provided them, though it did not take long for the lawyer’s time sheet to go from a record-keeping tool to a record-breaking profit generator.

I waited till they were back in the house before I went and picked it up.<p>So yeah. It’s a “fever and a cough”. I really hope that none of you ever have to experience that “fever and a cough”<p>Edit: Some bio facts about me. I was 43 when I caught it. At the time I was training with power lifting, CrossFit, and a lot of rucking. If I really pushed myself, I could hit a 7 minute mile (not competitively fast, but fast for me). I would call myself healthy at the time I contracted it.

You might like some of those artists because you might fall in the majority but you might not.<p>The search is part of the enjoyment.  Start listening to whatever you can find that you think you might like and if you don&#x27;t like it just put it aside and look for something else.  If you do like it, you will probably be compelled to find more music like it.  Look for interviews with the artist or band members and they&#x27;ll probably talk about their influences and other artists they themselves like.  Go listen to those artists and repeat the process.  If you like those artists keep digging.  If not, go somewhere else and find some other music.<p>There must be at least one song or artist who interests you.  I&#x27;d recommend starting there.  One of my favorite albums is Love Man, by Otis Redding.  Maybe give it a shot and see if you like it :)  <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;playlist?list=OLAK5uy_kyK5LvO6EbPrUCvFoBRpxAKMdYUISvZKE\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;playlist?list=OLAK5uy_kyK5LvO6EbPrUC...<\/a><p>Also, go see some live music.

For example, my I happen to like the music of the second Viennese school (well, Schoenberg and Webern; I don&#x27;t much like Berg&#x27;s work). My parents both regarded it with confusion. So I sat them down and played a whole series of pieces, first going back from common practice into the Renaissance to get outside common practice tonality, and then forward through Puccini to Stravinsky, each stepwise leading their ears so when we got to Schoenberg&#x27;s 4th string quartet they could hear it and say, &quot;Alright, I see how this isn&#x27;t a crazy departure and I kind of hear what&#x27;s going on.&quot;<p>Now, my parents were steeped in Baroque and classical period music, so their starting point is unlikely to help you.<p>Someone else suggested a music appreciation course, which probably is the right way. You need some kind of framework to explore in and enough sampling of the space to be able to get a hint of what you like.<p>If you just want to get started right now, I suggest starting with the Beatles, which are the only artists that I think pretty much every western musician of the 20th century is conversant with, from Baroque music specialists to grunge metal players."],"time":["2020-08-19 17:55:08"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["cultus"],"id":[24210285],"kids":{},"parent":[24209025],"text":["For me, listening to human DJs on non-commercial radio stations has expanded my knowledge and tastes massively.

Granted your film-literature preferences, a good territory to start explorations from would be watch a few music movies, like the history of the Doors etc. that could give you the context needed and you are all set for many months of listening. But is all largely about youthful energy, about love, a man vs society, about dance and drugs. So - if you are not too young anymore - it can be a bit boring ;)<p>One exception would be jazz, that is a bit more complex to grasp, but again - you have a good series from Ken Burns to start with. That being said, to enjoy jazz truly in it&#x27;s more complex genres, I would argue at least certain musical background is beneficial, maybe some youtube talks etc.<p>Classical music... well this is a true ocean. Just Beethoven piano sonatas could be a passion for a year or two. You&#x27;re talking about XX century, and there&#x27;s been great classical music published in that period! But probably - if you go that route - you really want to start with renaissance and baroque. Here a lot of great introductory courses are available. If you don&#x27;t have musical background, Robert Greenberg series on Great Courses is really an entertaining and valuable intro.<p>And then there is world music, ranging from African roots bands playing drums to Indian classical music.<p>Now - having all that said - my personal perspective is that to enjoy music, you want to enjoy music. What I mean by that, is that you might want to dance, sing, play! Even a simple baroque dance, played by your self, could be way more gratifying that latest dull pop hit. If you really want to enjoy music and not just be a pop music encyclopedia who knows names of The Beatles - you should do one of these!"],"time":["2020-08-19 16:09:09"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mushufasa"],"id":[24210806],"kids":{},"parent":[24209025],"text":["There&#x27;s the beatles, which are worth following chronologically as a sense of how pop music evolved.

I still probably get through 10 or so new releases a week, a fair amount of older stuff I&#x27;ve never heard, and a lot of &#x27;comfort&#x27; records. The problem with top XYZ lists is you have to be &#x27;open&#x27; to listening to them, and for some records it definitely helps to have some reference points in the form of &#x27;stuff you know&#x27; to frame why they&#x27;re significant. It took me years to see the genius in some records that later become favourites.<p>Whilst I became much open to exploring genres as I got older, and whilst my tastes are now far more varied, primarily I still listen to a lot of alternative&#x2F;punk and hip-hop. I&#x27;ll occasionally listen to more electronic music, but with the rare exception anything too house&#x2F;techno&#x2F;etc. just doesn&#x27;t work for me as much. I also find when exploring back catalogues it helps to hear the song over the production - a punk rock record from 1985 probably sounds like shit - but when you learn to hear the song you see how amazing it was. Definitely something a younger me struggled with (in a world of over produced music!).<p>I guess what I&#x27;m saying is <i>personally<\/i> I feel music is a lot like anything else. The more you surround yourself with it, the more you &#x27;get&#x27; it, the more genres bleed into one another. And the more you hear, the better frame of reference you have as to why some of the &#x27;best&#x27; records are what they are and sounds like they do.<p>TL;DR: Listen to lots and lots, keep exploring. Spotify is an incredible tool. Pick a genre, listen to what Spotify recommends. See what grabs you. If nothing does, try another genre. Keep trying until something grabs you. Then delve into the genre - you&#x27;ll find pretty soon that genres start to crossover.
