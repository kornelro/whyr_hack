That&#x27;s not surprising, in retrospect; neither of its major contemporaries, the Commodore PET 2001 nor the TRS-80 Model I, does either, despite being developed by major corporations with substantial resources.<p>He doesn&#x27;t explain why the Apple II+ (1979)—after the II&#x27;s market success was proven—doesn&#x27;t support lowercase letters. Even if software uses graphics mode to display lowercase letters, the II and II+&#x27;s keyboard does not have physical&#x2F;electrical support for detecting shifted letters. Since graphics mode is cumbersome and slow, word processors for the II and II+ typically use reverse video to indicate capital letters, and use another key like Escape as a shift toggle. A popular alternative is the shift-key mod that fattire mentioned, which requires soldering of a wire to one of the paddle ports.<p>The lack of support is because the company was working on the Apple III (1980), which it expected would quickly obsolete the II series. The III has built-in 80-column text and full lowercase support, at both the character-font and physical-keyboard levels. Apple had incentive to not make the II too attractive.<p>Neither Woz nor anyone else at Apple expected that a) the III would quickly fail, and b) the II series would remain Apple&#x27;s bread and butter. Without the III&#x27;s distraction the II+ would surely have had built-in lowercase software and hardware support, or there would have been another II around 1981 with such.

I can understand some Python library failing during the auto update process needing a rollback, but needing a complete reimage to fix the situation? How does that even happen?<p>&gt;  new protocol for the letsencrypt challenges was released, announced in some obscure corner of the web and bit by bit the old method of issuing new certificates was deprecated. You would not have known this unless you interacted with Letsencrypt on a daily basis, but like most of these things their whole value lies in NOT having to interact with them all the time.<p>Let&#x27;s Encrypt also sent out emails to people still using the old method at least two months before the old method was phased out. You have to provide an email address when setting up LE exactly for this reason. The only explanation I can think of for why the author wouldn&#x27;t have received an email is that they did not execute a renew check for their certificate in the three months leading up to the change of service, which is going straight against LE&#x27;s guidelines (you should check more often, exactly for this reason). This is the<p>&gt; which is odd because after all <i>the situation hasn’t changed and if it worked last time it should still work this time<\/i><p>The situation obviously _has changed_ otherwise the venv wouldn&#x27;t have been updated. Libraries get bugfixes even if those don&#x27;t apply to you specifically; deal with it. You&#x27;re not the only customer here.<p>&gt; I understand that Letsencrypt needs to stay with the times. But the Letsencrypt folks should also understand that in the greater scheme of things certificates are not the most important thing in life and that causing your end users this level of grief is in the longer term not in the projects’ best interest.<p>Web security is not a &quot;set and forget&quot; thing. It&#x27;s not a toggle button from &quot;insecure&quot; to &quot;secure&quot;. If you want a zero-maintenance certificate solution, get a managed server and get someone else to handle the annoying stuff for you.<p>&gt; The machine that this is all running on will need a much more recent version of its OS. That means I’m going to have to migrate a whole bunch of data to another machine in order to be able to do this without downtime.<p>This is unsurprising coming from someone who wrote a blog about why they don&#x27;t like to update. However, the assumption that the entire host OS needs to update just to use a new piece of software is simply wrong. Things like Docker and LXC make it trivial to run newer software without upgrading the entire system. It also forces the software into a contained space to prevent the catastrophic failure the author had to deal with before.\nFrom what I can tell from a Shodan check for this domain, the author still seems to be running Ubuntu 14 (which went EOL last year). That probably explains why the author is afraid that they will need to upgrade their server. However, if you&#x27;re running on a software stack whose LTS support has already been dropped, you&#x27;re just postponing the inevitable by not planning an upgrade plan already. Blaming Let&#x27;s Encrypt for potentially not supporting a platform nobody else supports is a silly excuse.<p>I agree that Let&#x27;s Encrypt has its issues. Sure, their client can use some thinning, their decisions are sometimes confusing, but the normal situation is not nearly as bad as the author describes here. If you&#x27;re bothered by the official client updating things, use a different client; there&#x27;s plenty of them."],"time":["2020-09-10 12:10:16"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["perryizgr8"],"id":[24433389],"kids":{},"parent":[24430260],"text":["The big fact of the matter is that https is usually unnecessary for most websites.

So cheap, in fact, that it’s too good to be true. In reality, all flash memory is riddled with defects — without exception. The illusion of a contiguous, reliable storage media is crafted through sophisticated error correction and bad block management functions. This is the result of a constant arms race between the engineers and mother nature; with every fabrication process shrink, memory becomes cheaper but more unreliable. Likewise, with every generation, the engineers come up with more sophisticated and complicated algorithms to compensate for mother nature’s propensity for entropy and randomness at the atomic scale.<p>These algorithms are too complicated and too device-specific to be run at the application or OS level, and so it turns out that every flash memory disk ships with a reasonably powerful microcontroller to run a custom set of disk abstraction algorithms. Even the diminutive microSD card contains not one, but at least two chips — a controller, and at least one flash chip (high density cards will stack multiple flash die).&quot;<p>[...]<p>&gt;&quot;The embedded microcontroller is typically a heavily modified 8051 or ARM CPU. In modern implementations, the microcontroller will approach 100 MHz performance levels, and also have several hardware accelerators on-die.<p><i>Amazingly, the cost of adding these controllers to the device is probably on the order of $0.15-$0.30<\/i>,<p>particularly for companies that can fab both the flash memory and the controllers within the same business unit. It’s probably cheaper to add these microcontrollers than to thoroughly test and characterize each flash memory chip, which explains why managed flash devices can be cheaper per bit than raw flash chips, despite the inclusion of a microcontroller.<p>The downside of all this complexity is that there can be bugs in the hardware abstraction layer, especially since every flash implementation has unique algorithmic requirements, leading to an explosion in the number of hardware abstraction layers that a microcontroller has to potentially handle. The inevitable firmware bugs are now a reality of the flash memory business, and as a result it’s not feasible, particularly for third party controllers, to indelibly burn a static body of code into on-chip ROM.&quot;<p>[...]<p>&gt;&quot;From the DIY and hacker perspective, our findings indicate a<p><i>potentially interesting source of cheap and powerful microcontrollers for use in simple projects.<\/i><p>An Arduino, with its 8-bit 16 MHz microcontroller, will set you back around $20.<p><i>A microSD card with several gigabytes of memory and a microcontroller with several times the performance could be purchased for a fraction of the price.<\/i><p>While SD cards are admittedly I&#x2F;O-limited, some clever hacking of the microcontroller in an SD card could make for a very economical and compact data logging solution for I2C or SPI-based sensors.&quot;"],"time":["2020-09-10 06:05:18"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["saagarjha"],"id":[24429270],"kids":[24432224],"parent":[24428755],"text":["microSD cards are part of the reason why I always amazed at how much stuff we can fit into such a small package."],"time":["2020-09-10 07:49:53"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["synack"],"id":[24428807],"kids":{},"parent":[24428755],"text":["(2013)"],"time":["2020-09-10 06:09:38"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["moonchild"],"id":[24429970],"kids":[24432862],"parent":[24410641],"text":["&gt; since registers are specified in sub-byte nibbles, one needs very good memory and tons of experience to predict what goes where<p>Nope, you just need to use octal instead of hex - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20041117160755if_&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dabo.de:80&#x2F;ccc99&#x2F;www.camp.ccc.de&#x2F;radio&#x2F;help.txt\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20041117160755if_&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dab...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-09-10 10:00:00"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["dang"],"id":[24410683],"kids":{},"parent":[24410641],"text":["Discussed a bit at the time: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=13938935\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=13938935<\/a>"],"time":["2020-09-08 19:36:15"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["ficklepickle"],"id":[24443918],"kids":{},"parent":[24410641],"text":["I thoroughly enjoyed that.

Illegally, by UK laws, and refuse to be held accountable for that in their own courts. Not that the judge even tries to demand reasonable treatment for Julian Assange from the prosecutor.<p>UK laws are very clear on what should happen in this case: because of the government&#x27;s treatment of Assange the case should be thrown out, because obviously the government has acted illegally against him on MANY occasions, they don&#x27;t even give him his rights INSIDE THE COURTROOM (to talk to his lawyer privately and however much he wants without interference). The government DOES NOT have the right to sue somebody for anything once they have tortured him. Once they have lied about the case, they lose the right to sue. Once they refuse medical aid to a prisoner, they lose the right to sue. They have spied on his communication with his lawyer, again grounds for dismissal. They are obviously not feeding him right, which again would normally disqualify the government&#x27;s case. Or at the very least, warrants a delay in the case with him decently taken care of until he is once again strong and fit enough to stand trial. Note that this is completely independent of the merit of the case itself: the QC in any normal case like this would never be allowed to make their case without fixing these issues first. Some of these reasons for dismissal the judge has seen happen right in front of him with his own eyes.<p>Then there is the fact that the UK government does not have evidence against Assange on this crime (because he violated US law, not UK law), furthermore I do not see how it could -legally- obtain any such evidence.<p>And yet this farce continues.

He relies on the dirty work of others to make himself famous. He is a fraud—a coward hiding behind a screen.<p>&gt; First, it is high time we called out those who grant a platform to these leakers and so-called transparency activists. We know the danger that Assange and his not-so-merry band of brothers pose to democracies around the world. Ignorance or misplaced idealism is no longer an acceptable excuse for lionizing these demons.<p>&gt; Third, we have to recognize that we can no longer allow Assange and his colleagues the latitude to use free speech values against us. To give them the space to crush us with misappropriated secrets is a perversion of what our great Constitution stands for. It ends now.<p>But if you listen to the UK prosecutor, Assange is just being prosecuted because some low-level prosecutor in the US decided, on their own initiative, to build a case against him. The fact that high-level officials in the US government have been openly calling for an example to be made of Assange is supposed to be irrelevant.<p>The UK should have dismissed this extradition request out-of-hand when it was first made, given the obvious political motivations behind it. The US-UK extradition treaty makes it very clear that extradition is not allowed in such cases.<p>1. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cia.gov&#x2F;news-information&#x2F;speeches-testimony&#x2F;2017-speeches-testimony&#x2F;pompeo-delivers-remarks-at-csis.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cia.gov&#x2F;news-information&#x2F;speeches-testimony&#x2F;2017...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-09-10 13:08:07"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["friendlybus"],"id":[24430854],"kids":[24430915],"parent":[24430207],"text":["Odd characterizations.<p>&quot;At this point he was grinning very strangely indeed, looking up at the judge, leaning back with one arm wide across his chair back, in some sort of peculiar alpha male gesture.&quot;<p>Similar to a roald dahl book."],"time":["2020-09-10 12:27:15"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["chmod775"],"id":[24431077],"kids":[24431231,24432276,24431221],"parent":[24430207],"text":["While I appreciate the reporting from inside the court room, Craig Murray is clearly biased and thus predisposed to seeing what he wants to see.<p>His characterizations paint the prosecution as ridiculous characters and their case as laughable at best, which may not reflect reality as much one would hope.<p>So what he is describing might be very unlike what the judges are experiencing, and if they end up giving the extradition of Assange&#x27;s the go-ahead, a lot of people are going to be very surprised.<p>Edit: This rollercoaster of upvotes and downvotes on a post that just reminds people to not blindly trust someone who tells them what they want to hear is interesting in itself."],"time":["2020-09-10 13:05:38"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["tikhonj"],"id":[24437446],"kids":[24447752,24439876,24448232],"parent":[24421490],"text":["Funny to see this article—I was interning at a company that used S-expressions instead of JSON internally right around the time this post was written.

Maybe this could be fixed in a json extension which allows words to be read as strings of themselves but if you extend json you lose any interoperability. Json also doesn’t have comments.<p>There are some arguments for or against alists&#x2F;plists instead of json “dictionaries”. An obvious point is that only one of these allows for non-string keys. A weak concern I have is about using “the wrong type”, eg if you use an array you sort of imply an ordering, and an object an unordered mapping, so should you put unordered data like a set in an array or should you have a map full of null values?<p>In recent years, languages with tagged unions like haskell or rust have become more popular. I feel like there’s no satisfying way to write such a thing as json (relying on field names to disambiguate is only sometimes possible and feels tricky to read, having an object with a tag field or an array of [tag, value] feels unnatural. With a sexp you can just write it with a list of tag and args but because everything is lists, it doesn’t feel so unnatural.<p>This isn’t related to json vs sexps but having a difference between &quot;123&quot; and 123 in your text format kind of sucks. Either the parser will reject one or go to the trouble of parsing both or there’s a semantic difference between them which feels worse.

The most recent rise in cases, to more than 2,600 a day, is particularly unsettling.<p>One thing the article briefly mentioned but didn&#x27;t really dig into (IMO) is that the peak of 5,451 cases on April 5th is basically a meaningless number and that it is important to try to figure out what the real number should have been.<p>On April 5th, the UK was only doing 16,000 tests a day and had a nearly 40% positive rate for tests. Only very sick people were being tested. That implies that the 5,451 cases detected that day is a vast undercount of the actual number of new cases at that point. It is bad data science to keep reporting that peak case number in comparison with the current case numbers as if it means anything.<p>So how many new cases were there on April 5th? No one knows for sure, but various estimates based on community surveys guess that it was more like 100,000&#x2F;cases per day. That would be a very different graph than what gets attached to every news story.<p>Compare that with now, where the UK is doing ~200k tests a day (over 10x!). We also have much better community survey data now and can estimate that there are about 3,200&#x2F;cases a day right now. The daily testing is picking up the majority of those expected cases.<p>So if you actually compare numbers that are comparable (~100k cases&#x2F;~1000 deaths with ~3k cases&#x2F;~10 deaths), you get a much better idea of what is actually going on. Demographics are definitely working in our favor now, which keeps death rates lower. But it&#x27;s not like we have &quot;solved COVID treatment&quot; and can cure everyone now because we know to use steroids. It&#x27;s mostly that there just aren&#x27;t nearly as many people getting it right now as there were at the peak. Even if tomorrow we detected 5,451 cases again, there&#x27;s no reason to expect that the death rate should approach the peak because we are getting much closer at detecting all the sick people than before."],"time":["2020-09-10 12:44:14"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["ck2"],"id":[24428156],"kids":[24428204],"parent":[24426131],"text":["Steroids.

Maybe It Shouldn’t Be&quot;)<p><i>&gt; The PCR test amplifies genetic matter from the virus in cycles; the fewer cycles required, the greater the amount of virus, or viral load, in the sample. The greater the viral load, the more likely the patient is to be contagious.  This number of amplification cycles needed to find the virus, called the cycle threshold, is never included in the results sent to doctors and coronavirus patients, although it could tell them how infectious the patients are. In three sets of testing data that include cycle thresholds, compiled by officials in Massachusetts, New York and Nevada, up to 90 percent of people testing positive carried barely any virus, a review by The Times found.<p>&gt; ... One solution would be to adjust the cycle threshold used now to decide that a patient is infected. Most tests set the limit at 40, a few at 37. This means that you are positive for the coronavirus if the test process required up to 40 cycles, or 37, to detect the virus. Tests with thresholds so high may detect not just live virus but also genetic fragments, leftovers from infection that pose no particular risk — akin to finding a hair in a room long after a person has left, Dr. Mina said. Any test with a cycle threshold above 35 is too sensitive, agreed Juliet Morrison, a virologist at the University of California, Riverside. “I’m shocked that people would think that 40 could represent a positive,” she said. A more reasonable cutoff would be 30 to 35, she added. Dr. Mina said he would set the figure at 30, or even less. Those changes would mean the amount of genetic material in a patient’s sample would have to be 100-fold to 1,000-fold that of the current standard for the test to return a positive result — at least, one worth acting on.<\/i><p>Every published &quot;case&quot; should include the PCR cycle threshold to enable statistical analysis."],"time":["2020-09-10 04:41:26"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["lukehutch"],"id":[24427371],"kids":[24427841,24427472],"parent":[24426131],"text":["Because the average of infection has dropped by over 20 years."],"time":["2020-09-10 01:53:44"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["kristianpaul"],"id":[24427672],"kids":{},"parent":[24426131],"text":["So the metrics where misleading because testing was not constant and&#x2F;or performed same way across the same population distribution?"],"time":["2020-09-10 02:37:56"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["laurencerowe"],"id":[24429544],"kids":{},"parent":[24426131],"text":["This article could really do with a discussion of how the positive test rate is increasing over the past month, see: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ft.com&#x2F;content&#x2F;e26349e5-29d4-4797-96ea-a09aac8cd652\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ft.com&#x2F;content&#x2F;e26349e5-29d4-4797-96ea-a09aac8cd...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-09-10 08:39:12"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["pieceofcakedude"],"id":[24428515],"kids":[24428543,24429350],"parent":[24426131],"text":["Because we&#x27;re relying on a test which can barely be trusted.

Paler now,<p>Wearing a poppy bruise on his left temple,\nHe lay in the four-foot box as in his cot.\nNo gaudy scars, the bumper knocked him clear.<p>A four-foot box, a foot for every year."],"time":["2020-09-10 08:19:15"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["discreteevent"],"id":[24429974],"kids":{},"parent":[24404595],"text":["And some time make the time to drive out west<p>Into County Clare, along the Flaggy Shore,<p>In September or October, when the wind<p>And the light are working off each other<p>So that the ocean on one side is wild<p>With foam and glitter, and inland among stones<p>The surface of a slate-grey lake is lit<p>By the earthed lightning of a flock of swans,<p>Their feathers roughed and ruffling, white on white,<p>Their fully grown headstrong-looking heads<p>Tucked or cresting or busy underwater.<p>Useless to think you’ll park and capture it<p>More thoroughly.

While low band spectrum (850MHz) has decent penetrating power, the majority of 5G is deployed at ~5GHz and mm-Wave frequencies, where you won&#x27;t get much of any signal through a wall, or even on the other side of the building. This is why so many 5G base stations have to be deployed; the coverage just isn&#x27;t as good. But the improvements in base station handoffs and spectral efficiency will increase a carrier&#x27;s total capacity, even if the end user doesn&#x27;t see a massive benefit.<p>There are scenarios where you might see massive speeds, though. 5G heavily leverages Carrier Aggregation, where a client can connect to multiple channels at once, increasing bandwidth, and beam-forming, where the &quot;shape&quot; of the signal is modified to steer maximum power to the physical location of a client. If you happen to be near a base station with good Signal to Noise Ratio while downloading something large, the base station can allocate multiple channels and use beamforming to finish your download at Gbps speeds and get you off the network faster, freeing up spectrum time for more users at lower SNR&#x27;s and bandwidths.<p>There is potential for much more impactful deployment of 5G cellular in rural areas where there aren&#x27;t many buildings or walls blocking high frequency signal.

I can see myself switching over to Mimestream. One of my recent complaints is the lack of deep integration with GSuite. If you can match the speed &amp; shortcuts AND integrate deeply with GSuite, I think you have something really compelling.<p>&gt; The app is a traditional email client that makes direct connections to Gmail and stores your data on your Mac. There are no intermediary servers with access to your account or copies of your messages. Mimestream is free for a limited time during the public beta, but will eventually be a paid app by the time it gets to the Mac App Store.<p>I appreciate the thought behind this. However, it means you can&#x27;t implement some other features (pixel tracking, scheduled send, snooze) unless GSuite opens up an API for them. Consider having a subscription which uses a 3rd party server.
