Next to the trillions in costs from unmitigated climate change, and even the expense of cutting CO2, solar geoengineering costs practically nothing. If anything, it’s too cheap. A program that releases SO2 to decrease average temperatures by about 0.1C would cost less than $5 billion per year. This should prompt the world to prepare for its inevitability.

(Somehow, the Digitalk (? Memory is hard.) image we were passing around developed a bug, probably from something in the FFI. It would periodically just crash. No way to fix it---it originally started while our proggy was working but eventually worked its way out until it happened anytime---because something in the image itself was corrupted.

And it still involved shipping the whole language, image and environment.<p>These aren&#x27;t just some &quot;nice to have&quot; features; they were significant friction that made doing anything real difficult.

Source of the Perlis quote:<p>&quot;<i>It isn’t going to do us a bit of good to throw before them  [those for whom FORTRAN is mother&#x27;s milk] an APL one-liner that will do as well as 50 lines of FORTRAN. First of all, it will take the people a long time to learn how to use the one-liner and even more to write one, so that FORTRAN will continue to grow and succeed. And I don’t think APL will usurp its position; there’s no reason why it should. And it certainly shouldn’t be a goal of people who use APL to stand forth and say, “Why do you jackasses use these inferior linguistic vehicles when we have something here that’s so precious, so elegant, which gives me so much pleasure? How can you be so blind and so foolish?” That debate you’ll never win, and I don’t think you ought to try.<\/i>&quot;<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jsoftware.com&#x2F;papers&#x2F;perlis78.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jsoftware.com&#x2F;papers&#x2F;perlis78.htm<\/a><p>Yes, folks, Alan Perlis is talking about APL, Greek letters and all.<p>Another quote from that:<p>&quot;<i>As a professor, one of the things I’m interested in doing is teaching people how to program; but it’s more than teaching them how to program, because to teach people how to program, any programming language is sufficient. The idea that only one language or any particular language is critical to learning what it means to program is false. If that is your goal, to teach people how to build programs, BASIC is perfectly satisfactory. There are some things you can’t do in it; therefore, you invent constructions for doing them; and the invention of these constructions is learning to program. Sooner or later, in all languages, we have to go to constructions which we build laboriously and arduously out of the components of the language. And we curse the fact that the language doesn’t have them already. But they are not all there now, and they never will be there. The word that I associate with programming — and I’m sure everybody associates with programming — is: “frustration”. Everything is possible, and nothing is easy. We sit down to write a program, and our initial, beautiful thoughts soon get bogged down in the slime of unavailable constructions. And we write procedures, or functions, or what-have-you, and more functions; we invent data structures, and more data structures; and the programs which start out so nice and elegant soon become mired down and have no structure. We find it difficult to describe to anyone else what they do. And we say, “If I programmed differently, if I used, for example, ‘structured programming’ this wouldn’t happen … if I had arrays of arrays this wouldn’t happen … if I had a while-statement this wouldn’t happen …” Nonsense. If it doesn’t happen today, it will happen tomorrow, even with all those things there. Because programming, by its very nature, is a kind of bootstrapping activity. What Iverson and God give you today, you’ll find insufficient tomorrow.<\/i>&quot;<p>I love Alan Perlis."],"time":["2020-06-03 22:10:20"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Gys"],"id":[23404181],"kids":{},"parent":[23402199],"text":["About Smalltalk"],"time":["2020-06-03 17:07:15"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["claudiulodro"],"id":[23403950],"kids":{},"parent":[23399746],"text":["At the risk of being &quot;that guy&quot;, this post really isn&#x27;t fit for a Show HN:<p>&gt; Show HN is for something you&#x27;ve made that other people can play with.

They&#x27;re like gems, versus entire well crafted pieces of furniture.<p>In fact, in my own newest philosophical writing I&#x27;ve been attempting to write in a more dense and aphoristic style, as opposed to the wordy, turgid, and pedantically argued style which characterized the majority of my prior work. I do this simply because I think it allows for more pleasure in reading and more depth in certain kinds of understanding, and allows the reader to borrow idea of mine that they like even if they don&#x27;t accept the system or the argument.

People like to bring up the pigeonhole principle as if it&#x27;s a mathematical proof that there can never be a practical algorithm for compressing random data. But the truth is if there&#x27;s so many different ways to represent data then we might never run into a situation where it&#x27;s actually relevant.<p>The other fault I see in these comments is the knee-jerk reaction over using a PoW-inspired algorithm for set reduction. Why is that? Could it be because blockchain technology is no longer in your favourite hype cycle and you need to signal to all your tech buddies that you&#x27;re in the know by bandwagoning like everyone else? PoW is far superior to other ways to reduce the sets and has the added bonus that nonces are more compressible.<p>The point that I got to with this research is having 14 bits left over per set to save offsets after filtering results. I was running some code yesterday and noticed that using 3 x 3 bit fields to save the number of zero bit information in the hashes produced low offsets. I think that this could be compressed with the same simple quotient idea I already wrote about to fit in the 14 bits so that you could quickly filter and recover the sets and dereference the original data.<p>This would reduce 1024 bytes to around 1015~ which would be more than enough to solve the 20+ year compression challenge and refute claims that random data can&#x27;t be compressed. Of course, the cluster that I built to run my code is too slow and I&#x27;m getting tired of waiting. So I will need a break from this.

I strongly suspect spontaneous protests without organization will be found to have the most potential for violence, while those with organizers committed to self-policing and, ideally, cooperating with police will be found to have fared much better.<p>Individual people may be intelligent and responsible, but crowds have their own rules of behaviour and need to be managed.  Protests are more dangerous when unplanned or when their organizers give no thought to self-policing.<p>There will always be organizers who <i>want<\/i> violence because it reliably brings press coverage and attention to their protests, but social media is also creating new problems.  Coordinating a large number of people to show up at the same time and place used to take considerable planning and effort.  When you have to work <i>hard<\/i> just to get the even to happen, why wouldn&#x27;t you plan how it will unfold as well?  Now a couple of tweets or posts on the right reddit subs will suffice.  How can police meet with the organizer of a protest when it&#x27;s really just some dude who had a lot of social media followers and might not even bother showing up himself?"],"time":["2020-06-02 04:05:52"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["WillDaSilva"],"id":[23386227],"kids":[23387085,23386283,23386273],"parent":[23385741],"text":["&quot;Of course, as Gillham pointed out, negotiating and managing a protest can’t really work if the protest wasn’t organized ahead of time.

This is from NC State Senator Jeff Jackson. He represents a district in Charlotte.<p>----<p>Last night I went into uptown at around 7:00 p.m. to do my part to help keep the peace.<p>Our city had already had a peaceful and powerful protest earlier that afternoon with a message of love and justice and it was important that the evening protest stayed safe and civil.<p>At the beginning there were roughly 1,500 people. That’s about half the number who were at the afternoon protest. The evening group was also much younger. I’d put the average age at about 24.<p>That meant the tone was audibly different. The conversations I had were different. It was a more personal perspective from people who weren’t just marching for others - they were also marching for themselves. There were more people in this crowd who felt that this issue directly concerned them and their friends, and you could hear that in their voices.<p>The leaders of the protest had met earlier that day with CMPD to discuss how to ensure the event was safe. As a result, the leaders placed experienced activists at the front of the march, in the middle, and in the rear. They kept the march moving, occasionally stopping for a few minutes to let people re-group, but not letting too much heat build in any one spot.<p>Alongside real anger and frustration were constant displays of compassion. Lots of people brought water bottles and were handing them out. I saw a woman trip and hurt her leg and the crowd immediately stopped and tended to her.<p>Law enforcement was present in various ways. There were some officers in regular uniform walking among the crowd, answering questions and chatting. There were also several officers on bicycles and motorcycles. Most of the police presence was blocking certain streets to keep the march from heading certain directions.<p>By the time the march got to the police station it had been going for over two hours and it had shrunk to maybe 300 people. About 10 officers stood outside the front door, motionless. The protesters got as close as they could to the police without making contact. One officer raised his fist in solidarity and was greeted with loud applause and cheering from the crowd. At one point someone threw a water bottle at the police and everyone turned around and yelled at him. There were some very tense moments near the police station, but after about 30 minutes the march headed back uptown.<p>Now it was about 10:40 p.m. The march had been going for over three hours. It wasn’t a coherent group anymore. There were less than 200 people. It had splintered into lots of little groups and there wasn’t any organization that I could see. I thought it was basically over so I started to head back to my car.<p>At 10:50 p.m. I heard the first flashbang. Then I saw the tear gas. I was two blocks away so I couldn’t tell what, if anything, precipitated its use (although I later read a CMPD statement that bottles and rocks were being thrown).<p>But the flashbang had a catalyzing and organizing effect on the remaining protesters, who instantly re-formed.<p>This marked the point of a clear shift in police tactics. Officers lined up shoulder-to-shoulder and walked block by block, toward the protesters, who similarly lined up shoulder-to-shoulder and waited for the police to move toward them.<p>Officers would then proceed down one block, wait five minutes, use a loudspeaker to tell the crowd to disperse, and then start walking toward the crowd. Then they would use tear gas and pepper bullets, which would cause the crowd to retreat one block.<p>This continued for several blocks, until eventually the remaining protesters scattered. Nine arrests were made.<p>I’m not aware of any injuries. As far as property damage, I heard a few reports of a few broken windows, but nothing extensive.<p>It’s really easy to see one picture or hear a snippet on the news and draw a conclusion about an event like this. What I saw was much more complex, much more human. If it’s one thing we all owe each other right now, it’s looking past the surface and trying to learn a little more about what’s really going on underneath.<p>What I learned last night is that the tenor of these events can change on a dime. But you can feel it when it happens. I also learned that the vast, vast majority of protesters were there to engage in peaceful, safe protest. Although many of them felt genuine anger, they understood what it meant to channel it productively and what type of conduct would undercut their message.<p>My thanks to the leadership of this event for working hard to keep everyone as safe as possible.<p>- Sen.

From a sociological perspective, most people don&#x27;t want to be beating a drum that runs counter to popular opinion.<p>Similarly, most people are reluctant to engage in confrontation on an individual level, when encountering behaviour that ultimately leads to these type of outcomes.<p>Just as importantly, most people are awful at taking responsibility for their role in a problem. People prefer to create a false dichotomy, and position their impact on problems as meaningless, and view solutions as outside their locus of control.<p>This effectively leads to a kind of tragedy of the commons, where responsibility belongs to everyone and is taken by noone - similar to what we see with climate issues.<p>To effect meaningful change, it&#x27;s usually required that both individuals and groups make their voice heard and actually do something. Yet most people go about their lives, and only take action when the collective does, in response to some climax of conditions. This is better than the inverse - of individuals taking action while groups do nothing - yet usually results in neglibile change, if any.<p>I suspect a part of the problem is that a sizable demographic cares, but only insofar as they care to signal their virtues.

I would write a paragraph that addressed the human brain&#x27;s remarkable facility for interpreting facial expressions. I&#x27;d then plug that paragraph into the software, and ask it to find other, similar passages in my archive. Instantly, a list of quotes would be returned: some on the neural architecture that triggers facial expressions, others on the evolutionary history of the smile, still others that dealt with the expressiveness of our near relatives, the chimpanzees. Invariably, one or two of these would trigger a new association in my head -- I&#x27;d forgotten about the chimpanzee connection -- and I&#x27;d select that quote, and ask the software to find a new batch of documents similar to it.

Only simple note-taking would suffice to ease your brain.<p>On the contrary, if you are reading papers and doing research, taking notes in a meaningful way is more helpful than you would realize. The human brain tends to skip information while reading and you only realize you didn&#x27;t actually understand that part when you try to write it yourself. The note-taking part doesn&#x27;t actually take that much brain resources. I am not a native English speaker but I am taking my notes in English. While taking my notes I don&#x27;t care about grammar or anything, I just read and write what I understood. When I finish the paper and I am comfortable with the topic, I return to my notes, fix grammars and, link them with my other notes. For example, sometimes I come up with a research idea, I make a note about it. In the future, while reading a paper, I realize some of the techniques that are described in the paper might be beneficial to that idea so I link them together.<p>In conclusion, it really depends on your area of work whether to take regular notes or Zettelkasten notes.

I don&#x27;t know if this is strictly a &quot;Zettelkasten&quot; or not.<p>My note box for the last little while is Dercuano: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;canonical.org&#x2F;~kragen&#x2F;dercuano\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;canonical.org&#x2F;~kragen&#x2F;dercuano<\/a>.  The notes are longer than a single index card (there are 882 notes averaging about 1300 words each), and they are hierarchically organized into sections and subsections. They often include links to other notes or other web pages, and they also have a chronological order and a set of tags.  And I frequently grep them. I kept them in Git to keep them synchronized across different computers.<p>Typically a single note draws from many sources, and I tried to keep their contents in a readable order, which is easier to do on a computer where you can insert stuff in the middle. Some notes are one afternoon&#x27;s thoughts, while others got added to and reorganized for years. So that&#x27;s one way I make connections: I add hyperlinks, new data, explanations of how and why the entire rest of a note is wrong, new sources, etc. Another is that the process of writing a note involves bringing together different ideas, since few of the notes are just summaries of things others have written.<p>I learned a lot writing Dercuano, but in the end I was more frustrated than effective.  I have a series of paper notebooks that are much less voluminous, only a few hundred pages a year, which are worse for text and hyperlinks, but much better for drawing, even things like schematics. Computers offer the potential of doing simulation, calculation, logic, optimization, rendering, data analysis, and data integration, the things that Engelbart and Kay envisioned in the 1960s. Yet Dercuano is stuck in the textual world without even transclusion or sketches.  A much better medium is possible.<p>And we have lots of examples: spreadsheets, Jupyter notebooks, observable explanations in JS, diagrams in KSeg or GeoGebra, Observablehq and all of Bostock&#x27;s previous excellent work. These show us that a better medium is achievable. But incorporating such a model into a note like the ones in Dercuano maybe requires some UI work. I mean the whole revolution of VisiCalc was that you could see the results of your calculation as you changed the calculation, and that doesn&#x27;t really fit well into editing text files in Emacs.<p>Things like Darius Bacon&#x27;s Doe and Halp do go some distance toward that integration for textual output. And R-Markdown integrates statistical analysis and data visualization with text, and Ward&#x27;s Smallest Federated Wiki incorporates different media types on one page, including bytebeat. And I understand that org-mode SRC blocks offer the possibility of displaying image output inline. Still, none of these seem like they can scale to interactively doing a compass-and-straightedge construction or drawing a schematic for an analog circuit.

Take care of the physical keys with proper storage and procedures. Do not store the keys together, have at least one in a <i>really<\/i> secure location, check if you have all the keys regularly, etc.<p>5. Test restores at least once per quarter, with a randomly selected key.<p>The advantages of this solution is that it is simple, works pretty well, and gets you a lot of mileage with relatively little inconvenience. You don&#x27;t have the risk of keys being copied, and guarding physical keys is easier than digital ones.<p>You still have the problem of guarding the passphrases to the Yubikeys (if you use them), but that is much less of a problem than guarding the encryption keys. A passphrase without the physical key is useless.<p>This setup works for organization from size 1 up to fairly large ones.<p>Note that some recently fashionable security consultants crap on GPG from great height, but do not provide an alternative.

I was surprised to find out how uncommon using a debugger for Python development was when I joined my team at work. I had to muddle through lots of documentation to figure out how to use it in certain situations and also to figure out alternative things when the first approach didn&#x27;t work. I looked into PyCharm but opted to use VSCode as my main editor since the debugging support seemed easier to configure both for local and especially for remote.<p>We have a flask app and one hurdle I had to overcome was our docs all assumed you&#x27;d run the app via gunicorn, but VSCode had trouble triggering breakpoints so I had to figure out how to run the app via the flask module directly, which was a bit of work since our app isn&#x27;t following most of the getting started with flask tutorials conventions.<p>For another project we use celery, VSCode can be used to debug celery tasks but it&#x27;s also work to set up and in the end I found using the rdb.set_trace() debugging provided by celery was easier. An important lesson I learned while working on that project is that you need to be sure you&#x27;re setting your breakpoints in the right version of your app: if you are using a setup.py install step the code you want to debug is probably somewhere in site-packages not wherever you installed it from.<p>For another project, we&#x27;re using python 2.7 on Centos 6: VSCode debugging &amp; remote tools don&#x27;t easily support that setup so knowing pdb or doing log debugging are the best bets. Something important on log-based debugging this article doesn&#x27;t mention: if you&#x27;re developing a long-running app like a daemon or service of some kind: you should probably make your log config loading dynamic. The one provided in the article is nice if your script is one-off, but if you are running a service you may want to be able to dynamically adjust the logging to be more verbose when an issue occurs and then reset it when done debugging without having to start&#x2F;stop the whole service. I inherited code that runs as a service and in order to change the log level I have to stop the service, change the config and restart. The start&#x2F;stop is destructive: if you stop the service the action it was performing has to be redone from the beginning. These are tasks that can take 8-12 hours so restarts are painful. Debug logs can be huge so you can&#x27;t just leave the service in debug log mode all the time unless you want to fill up the whole disk. Which brings up another point: rotating log files—if you&#x27;re doing heavy logging you need to be sure you have set up rotation so that you don&#x27;t eat through disk space indiscriminately.<p>In my ideal world every project I work on could have breakpoints trigger my editor&#x27;s tools so I can inspect and alter code on the fly, but knowing there&#x27;s more than one way to go about it and how to approach it when you don&#x27;t have control is important."],"time":["2020-06-02 12:46:26"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["lmilcin"],"id":[23388723],"kids":[23388778,23389015],"parent":[23386537],"text":["TLDR: Guide to python debugging that doesn&#x27;t mention debugger and says &quot;logging is a must&quot;."],"time":["2020-06-02 09:53:49"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["zmmmmm"],"id":[23388087],"kids":[23388767],"parent":[23386537],"text":["I feel like I got in a time machine ... this like debugging from 1995.

Why? Who knows. I did everything I could like closing other apps, disabling ton of things running in background; I freeze tracks in my DAW but things still break sometimes.

That is, everything you hovered over &#x2F; clicked &#x2F; dragged behaved &quot;the way a mac should&quot; -- without having to even think about it.

My first computer I bought with my own money was a Windows laptop in 1995 when I went to college.  Mac really wasn&#x27;t an option then, Classic Mac OS was terrible for a CS student, didn&#x27;t run any of the required software I needed, and were super expensive.  That was pretty much Apple&#x27;s darkest hour.  Laptops were stupid expensive back then, so 1997, 2000, 2003, etc.. I built&#x2F;rebuilt my own homebuilt desktops on the cheap.<p>2004 I got a Mac Mini.\n2006 I got a Mac Pro.<p>2012 Apple pissed me off dropping support for the Mac Pro, so I went back to a homebuilt windows desktop.  Actually used a case I had laying around from 2004-2005 as well.   Less than 1&#x2F;3 the investment of the Mac Pro.  That machine is still in service now with just a better video card + SSD.   Great machine, still very snappy, but I am getting tempted to rebuild it.<p>Also grabbed a Surface Pro i5 for $800 in 2017.  Very happy with that machine, but it gets used for home consumer type stuff and not development work.<p>In the meantime I&#x27;ve had a whole bunch of Macbook Pros for work from 2012-2020.<p>The 2018 15&quot; MBP I have right now is by far the most disappointing Mac experience..<p>A lot of my issue is that I work on a product that runs in Docker... docker sucks on Mac IMO, and most of my issues are around needing more RAM &amp; CPU for hyperkit &amp; docker to suck down.. but the Mac is rampant with high latency in the UI and other issues that drive me nuts.<p>- Keyboard is starting to fail, and it sucks, not even comfortable.  I&#x27;m stuck at home so it&#x27;s trickier for IT to give me a new MBP.   When I was going to the office I could mostly ignore the KB and use external, circumstances around lockdown have meant more use of the internal KB issues.<p>- Hate the touchbar, never gotten any decent use out of it.  And I use vi plenty of course.<p>- I have some of the palm rejection issues the blogger mentions but that&#x27;s not so bad.<p>- OSX seems to be bottom of the barrel when it goes into swap, linux and windows both seem to handle high memory usage better.<p>- USB-C has been nothing but a PITA.  Didn&#x27;t need so many dongles with the older Macbook Pro and the USB-C doesn&#x27;t buy me much.   I have yet to have any device with a USB-C plug that can plug right into the MBP 2 years later.<p>- Quality of audio on the headphone jack is horrific on my 2018 MBP... it has the most noise of any PC I&#x27;ve ever had, not even in the same ballparks as my previous MBP which was great.  Not sure what&#x27;s going on here.<p>- Battery life on MBP is fine except when using docker or running builds.   Then it&#x27;s like an hour or two."],"time":["2020-06-02 16:27:58"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["MattyMc"],"id":[23390037],"kids":{},"parent":[23388406],"text":["Outstanding review."],"time":["2020-06-02 13:54:29"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["dividedbyzero"],"id":[23393938],"kids":{},"parent":[23388406],"text":["I own a 2013 13&quot; Macbook Pro and currently use a 2017 13&quot; Macbook Pro at work, and I like the 2017 better.<p>The only gripes I have with the 2017 machine are the butterfly keyboard (which never broke, but just doesn&#x27;t feel good), the lack of an ESC key, and the &quot;space grey&quot; color.<p>From trying out a 2020 13&quot;, the new keyboard actually feels like an improvement over the 2013 one, so I guess that&#x27;s fixed. It has a physical ESC key, so that&#x27;s fixed too, and ... there&#x27;s always the silver model, but my employer couldn&#x27;t procure that at the time, and I guess it&#x27;s not such a big deal really; I just like shiny things I guess.<p>On the upside: I can get a tiny machine with 32GB RAM now with a UNIX on it that doesn&#x27;t require me to be my own Linux sysadmin, which is something I know fairly well how to do (I do admin a number of servers, and have had at least a dozen forays into Linux on desktops) but absolutely don&#x27;t enjoy to the point where I&#x27;d rather use Windows 8.<p>Besides, Touch ID is something I&#x27;ve grown to miss on the 2013 one, since I hate typing long passwords over and over again, and it even works for 1Password and apparently is reasonably safe at that.<p>I have a 34&quot; USB-C screen, which makes USB-C a really nice experience; single wire and I get display, a couple of USB devices (including my mechanical keyboard), LAN access, sound and power. Everything works out of the box, no issues so far with the 2017 Macbook. On the 2013 one, I had to use three cables for that (those Thunderbolt 2 docks never felt like good value for the money) and it turns out USB 3.0 does have its limitations.<p>I even like the touchbar. I&#x27;m fairly disinterested in peak keyboard speed and efficiency, I don&#x27;t need a debugger that often really, and I&#x27;m bad at memorizing keyboard shortcuts anyway, so I like being able to get a discoverable set of shortcuts on the touchbar. Setting brightness and volume has a lot more granularity, that&#x27;s nice too. I have a button to mute my microphone on there as well that shows the current muteness state, useful for conference calls in Teams (its mute shortcut is weird, plus this way I don&#x27;t show up as muted, which is better sometimes) and I look forward to trying out BetterTouchTool. I&#x27;ve seen other people use theirs as some kind of makeshift faders and fairly precise &quot;analog&quot; sliders for image processing and the like – not quite as nice as having dedicated devices for it, sure, but it&#x27;s always there. I thought I&#x27;d hate it since the overall tone in the developer community towards the touchbar is incredibly negative, but I&#x27;m fine with it and I would pick the touchbar version over a F-key one any day even at modest cost (but I need the ESC key; leaving that out actually did make a difference for me.)<p>Haven&#x27;t tried Catalina yet myself, but most of an office full of devs seemingly didn&#x27;t have much trouble with it (the rest has yet to switch), so I guess I&#x27;ll see what I find when I upgrade; I&#x27;m backing up my email just in case. But in the end it&#x27;s probably still a UNIX that doesn&#x27;t require me to become a hobby sysadmin and reboot after using the wrong projector, so I&#x27;ll probably still be happier than with Linux, and somehow I just can&#x27;t grow to like Windows.<p>That&#x27;s just my personal experience, n=1 and all, and I don&#x27;t use my machines to make music or develop in emacs all day at maximum keystroke throughput and so on, and I might hate the experience if I did, but as things stand, I&#x27;m currently still feel kinda positive towards Macbooks."],"time":["2020-06-02 19:59:10"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["snarfy"],"id":[23390203],"kids":{},"parent":[23388406],"text":["You&#x27;re holding it wrong."],"time":["2020-06-02 14:22:24"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["malcolmxtucker"],"id":[23399650],"kids":{},"parent":[23388406],"text":["Way opposite experience.

SmartScreen is a reputation-based safety feature that allows &#x27;know&#x27; downloaded software to run friction-free but interrupts the execution of &#x27;unknow&#x27; downloaded software with a &#x27;stranger-danger&#x27; warning. SmartScreen application reputation was first launched in IE9 (2010&#x2F;2011) and then was integrated into Windows (starting with Windows 8 in 2012). It has been a few years since I have worked on SmartScreen, but I thought providing some context may be interesting.<p>Windows 7 made great strides in addressing software vulnerabilities. And bad guys quickly moved from software vuln exploits to socially engineered attacks. They tricked users into download and running spurious programs (using a variety of techniques - ranging from SEO to scare-ware website that tricked people into thinking that their machines were compromised to running sophisticated ad campaigns). The problem with traditional anti-virus (AV) approach was that by the time the AV analysts could get their hands on a new binary, analyze it, classify it as malicious, write a signature, and distribute it - it was generally too late. The bad guys monetized the latency between when they published a new binary on the internet and when the AV vendors were able to effectively detect it as malware.<p>SmartScreen tried to flip that dynamic - by using reputation. By volume, majority of downloads were benign; there was no point in warning users when the likelihood of future infections from such downloads was nearly zero. However, for software that had never been seen before - there was a significant risk associated with it - all the yet-undetected-malware resided in that set (depending on the situation and context - the risk of future malware infection could range from 25% to 75%). So, for &#x27;known&#x27; software, SmartScreen eliminated the mostly-useless warning (that everyone had grown used to clicking through); for &#x27;unknown&#x27; software (which the AV companies still hadn&#x27;t deemed as malicious; yet-undetected-malware would be &#x27;unknown&#x27;), SmartScreen showed a &#x27;stranger-danger&#x27; warning. This was incredibly effective in stemming the socially engineered malware attacks. In the overwhelming majority of the cases - users did the right thing; they chose not to run the downloaded programs that were later detected as malicious. When SmartScreen was launched, nearly 7% of all downloads were later detected as malware by AV. In a couple of years, the incidence of socially engineered malware had dropped significantly (By a ton! By many orders of magnitude. Most bad actors changed their business model to bundleware - bundling unwanted, non-malicious, software with popular downloads). An important factor was that SmartScreen had expansive coverage on (knew about) all executable binaries downloaded from the Internet - in order to mitigate the risk of users getting used to ignoring the warnings if they saw those too often. Most users saw one or two SmartScreen warnings in a year. And, when they saw the warnings, the risk was significant - and users did the right thing in those cases (not run the downloaded program). SmartScreen provided highly effective 0-hour protection against socially engineered malware by helping users make the right trust-decisions.<p>There was some friction - for developers and advanced users (who downloaded esoteric, non-very-commonly-downloaded software more frequently). For developers, reputation came in two forms - either each individual binary that they published could &#x27;acquire&#x27; reputation - or if they had a code signing certificate - then that certificate could &#x27;acquire&#x27; reputation (and any binary that was signed with the certificate would inherit it; which was a better option). In either case, if the developer went rogue or published a program the was malicious - it was straightforward to deal with that problem. SmartScreen could instantaneously revoke the reputation for the certificate or the binary. There is a meaningful cost (time, behavior) that the developer incurred in order to get reputation - and it is hard, expensive, and not-scalable  for bad actors to &#x27;acquire&#x27; reputation - and if they did end up behaving badly after acquiring reputation (e.g. signing malware with code signing certs that has acquire reputation), that reputation would be lost very quickly - really hurting their ROI.<p>So yes - there was some friction. In many &#x2F; most cases, new executables and publishers &#x27;acquired&#x27; reputation after a short period (typically a few days) and many advanced users understood why they would occasionally see the SmartScreen warning and would make the right action choice. But the benefits to the larger ecosystem were incredibly significant and impactful."],"time":["2020-06-03 04:04:08"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ebg13"],"id":[23393698],"kids":[23393789,23393776],"parent":[23392404],"text":["Application signing is a mafia protection racket, plain and simple.<p>If you aren&#x27;t signed by an &quot;authority&quot;, every user is told by default automatically that your code is unsafe until you pay money.<p>It is 100% analogous to thugs walking into your store saying &quot;It would be a real shame if something were to happen to scare people away.&quot;<p>The message is &quot;We Protected You&quot; and &quot;Unsafe&quot;.
