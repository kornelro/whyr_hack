It just takes a little longer.<p>Put another way, each flame begets one or more flames, whereas each good comment might get responses but maybe it stands on its own. Over time the signal to noise ratio of any forum tends to degrade to nothing as the forum becomes more popular because of this.

It&#x27;s like entropy in that it only goes in one direction, it&#x27;s just a matter of time and how much you can push back on it. Bad comments beget more bad comments, but good comments don&#x27;t necessarily beget more good comments.

What is &quot;propaganda&quot;? What is &quot;misinformation&quot;? The entire core of Facebook&#x27;s existence is advertising, which means user engagement and reach is the only thing that drives your bottom line; they <i>want<\/i> to drive users to Facebook and keep them there, and keep them engaged. They&#x27;ve just happened to discover a universal human truth along the way, which is that people <i>like<\/i> feeling validated, and people <i>like<\/i> being a member of a tribe. Facebook is the way it is because thats what users <i>want<\/i>, whether they will admit to it or not.<p>Anything that Facebook does will be perceived as making a political and&#x2F;or moral statement, which they obviously are trying very hard not to do, because as soon as you take a position you alienate half of the population (at least in the US). They&#x27;ve apparently decided to go the route of burying their heads in the sand instead of <i>trying<\/i> to make things less tribal and divisive, which in all honesty is a pretty understandable position to take, and yet <i>even while actively trying not to piss off conservatives<\/i> they have still landed in hot water over perceived favoritism towards the left.

You want M for mega, which is 1,000,000.<p>Also if you <i>really<\/i> want to be precise you should consider whether you&#x27;re using binary prefixes vs SI prefixes, e.g. kB (10^3 bytes) vs kiB (2^10 bytes).

The costs are coming down steadily though as the tech improves. If you need to do millions of such documents, yeah a model will probably be worth it. But if you need to do a few hundred you probably should just do them manually.<p>The thing is, reality has surprisingly high resolution. When you give out a task like this to a person, they will likely come back to you for clarification about how you want to deal with some of the examples. Your initial requirements will be underspecified, or incorrect, in some details. When you are dealing with a person, these minor adjustments are pretty inconsequential, and so you don&#x27;t really notice it happening. The worker might also have enough context to guess what you want and not ask, and just tell you the summary when they deliver the work.<p>If you&#x27;re training a model, you need to work through all these annoying details about what you want, just as you would when you&#x27;re creating any other sort of program. This adds some overhead, and places a lower bound on how many examples you&#x27;ll need to have annotated -- you&#x27;ll always need enough examples of annotation to actually specify your requirements, including various corner-cases. You need enough contact with the data to realise which of your initial expectations about the task were wrong.<p>So there will always be a lower scaling limit, where the automation isn&#x27;t worthwhile for some small volume of work.

Critics would challenge the field by asking if philosophy has made any real contributions to human knowledge. Has it actually discovered anything that&#x27;s both non-obvious and conclusively true?<p>And apologists would that philosophy has made huge, unambiguous contributions. Only once this happens, those fields tend to be no longer considered &quot;philosophy&quot;. Astronomy, physics, economics, and logic were all sub-domains of philosophy originally. Once they were formalized, with rigorous, specialized methods they moved into their own standalone fields. But it was philosophers who laid the foundation. Consequently when we think of &quot;philosophy&quot;, there&#x27;s a lot of selection bias, because it&#x27;s basically the subset of open unsolved problems that remain.<p>I think there&#x27;a a close analogy here with what we think of as generalized &quot;business problems&quot;. There are many specialized sub-fields like finance, logistics, marketing, industrial psychology, and accounting. All of those things used to be thought of as a generic part of business. But eventually domain-specific methods and technologies led to the point where specialized practitioners unambiguously out-performed generalist C-suite executives.<p>Think of techniques like Markowitz portfolio optimization, or five factory personality testing, or applying Benford&#x27;s law to profile for accounting fraud. Those are all examples where something like AI&#x2F;ML solved what at the time was a generic business problem.

B2C ML systems can get it wrong, and customers are generally forgiving, because it&#x27;s a low stakes game. B2B applications are generally higher-stakes, because they impact business workflows, and if someone has decided to automate it, it&#x27;s probably a high-volume, critical workflow. It has to be extremely accurate, and demonstrably better than the equivalent human system.<p>The problem has to be well-defined enough that an ML system can act with high-accuracy, but not well-defined enough that a rule-system could replace it. Don&#x27;t use ML if a rule-system will do a better job. (For those scenarios, you can still put an ML anomaly-detection system to make sure the rule-system is still valid, and to guard against data input changes.) As just mentioned, the problem also has to be important enough and high-volume enough to warrant an ML solution. The percentage of problems that fulfill these criteria is not very large.<p>Now to actual ML development and deployment - the model is the tip of the iceberg. The rest of the iceberg is data acquisition, feature selection, data&#x2F;feature versioning, automated training, CI&#x2F;CD, model performance monitoring, et cetera. If ML is being developed inside a software development organization, this isn&#x27;t a problem, most people will understand this. If it is being developed within an embedded BI team inside a business unit - they will generally not have support&#x2F;runway needed to build the full system. The ML model might make it to production, but it will probably run naked, be brittle, and hard to retrain. A dramatic failure with business impact is just a matter of time.<p>There are a lot of low-code, no-code ML solutions that have been developed, or are being developed, and some of the supporting infrastructure as well, but, at the risk of sounding parochial&#x2F;protectionist, you need a rock-solid, end-to-end, integrated, data management system that is fully understood by whomever needs to pick up the phone at 2AM. It&#x27;s the interfaces that are hard, and chaining together a bunch of third-party black-box systems just means more interfaces and behavior you don&#x27;t control. Choose and use these systems wisely.<p>So yeah, B2B ML is hard. But it&#x27;s generally not due to lack of data, and transfer learning is generally not necessary. Understanding business processes is important, I agree, but that&#x27;s comparatively easy. It&#x27;s what consultants have been doing for decades. The hard part is choosing a problem where ML can add value, and then executing on it with enough integrity that people will actually trust it.<p>(1) Ok, clickbait might be harsh.

I&#x27;ve always felt that you don&#x27;t really understand a thing, even a simple thing like fractions, until you can find and resolve all the paradoxes that arise in using it naively.<p>My take when reading the 1&#x2F;3 + 1&#x2F;3 = 2&#x2F;6 equation is that Addison was right but the &quot;+&quot; here is a different operation than the &quot;+&quot; of 1&#x2F;3 + 1&#x2F;3 = 2&#x2F;3. In one case we are adding disjoint parts of the same whole and counting how much of the parts of the whole are now included, and get 2&#x2F;3, and in the other case we are adding two wholes and counting how much of the new whole is included.<p>People who pass primary education without internalizing this distinction will have to do so later if they learn statistics or probability theory.<p>The answer &quot;what would you do now?&quot; is the same one I would try to ask the students. First I would stop, confused, and write 1&#x2F;3 + 1&#x2F;3 = ? elsewhere on the board, and then wait for the students to see why I&#x27;m confused. They already understand that we want mathematics to be consistent, and getting different answers means we were wrong at least once, but they will have a hard time to find out or explain why 2&#x2F;6 and 2&#x2F;3 both are intuitively and obviously right. You have to compare the intuitions directly to each other to see that in one case you&#x27;re adding parts of the same whole (set or group or table of kids) and in another case adding the wholes.<p>From what I know of elementary school, we focus a lot on fractions and the formal manipulation of them as unitless values, and drill into kids that 2&#x2F;4, 1&#x2F;2, and 0.5 are all &quot;the same thing&quot;. Bullshit! It&#x27;s no wonder they have problems with word problems! Two-out-of-four apples and one-out-of-two apples and a half apple are very different things, as every elementary student knows well. How can we expect them to believe something that&#x27;s obviously false unless we&#x27;ve introduced the narrow context in which it&#x27;s true? When used as unitless &quot;coefficients&quot; or bare numbers that exist only to scale another value that represents a real quantity <i>of<\/i> something, <i>then<\/i> 1&#x2F;2 and 2&#x2F;4 are the same. <i>This<\/i> is what we should be teaching when we teach fractions, not some mindless rote symbol manipulation like cross-multiplying or what have you without any ability to intuitively derive those rules yourself.<p>I&#x27;d spend the rest of the class time letting them work out all the different ways of looking at it, and the connections to everything else fractions and ratios and addition are good for.<p>Of course we want to be able to have &quot;+&quot; be well-defined, especially in elementary school, and the students understand that! We&#x27;ve now found a perfectly intuitive meaning of addition for which our standard &quot;+&quot; definition does not fit! This gives an opportunity to explore the connections between mathematics and intuition and the symbols and the real world operations they stand for. It gives us an excellent chance to, as Polya puts it, &quot;introduce a suitable notation&quot; for the setwise addition of &quot;marked&quot; sets that we have just discovered. Then we can explore the properties of this operation and the ones between it and the familiar addition operation. We can show that the plus sign and the addition operation we use it to represent are distinct, and our use of one for the other is a choice, and one we could make differently.<p>I saw some mentions of units in the comments, and yet 1&#x2F;3 + 1&#x2F;3 = ? is still ill-defined if we know only that &quot;1&#x2F;3&quot; means &quot;one out of three students&quot;. What we need to know is which students they are! So if one out of Alice, Bob, and Charlie has red hair, and one out of Charlie, Doris, and Evan has red hair, how many of Alice, Bob, Charlie, Doris, and Evan have red hair? Well, we made the question challenging even for adults if we ask it that way! And now you can introduce uncertainty and degrees of belief. (What if three people tell you they have one red-headed friend, in a class of 23 students? Do they all have the same friend, or is there more than one redhead?)<p>Of course what most of us will actually do as the teacher in this situation is freeze and think &quot;oh no, I&#x27;ve made a mistake and the teacher (in your mind) is going to point it out and the class is going to laugh at me!&quot;. Because that&#x27;s what we&#x27;ve learned happens in these situations.

It makes everything so much more rich. The Rabbit Girl referenced in the article is from Undertale by Toby Fox, who cut his teeth in gamemaking creating Earthbound mods.

There’s no great way to offer a scale-to-zero database like Datastore or BigQuery without “internalizing” the multitenancy. But then it’s on you as the implementor to ensure isolation (both security and performance).<p>In your scenario, if you could make each database small enough (or use a database that handles the multitenancy for you) you gain a lot in terms of “capability” for enterprises. Customer X wants a feature that you know how to do but aren’t sure it should be for everyone? Their instance is separate. Customer Y has a drastically different read pattern and should have a high-IO instance? Great.<p>The easiest advice though is: wait until after you need it. A single replicated pgsql or MySQL can go insanely far. Let your business needs push you to the more complicated architecture, later. Prefer whatever gets you to a success disaster.

Database per tenant works alright if you have enterprise customers - i.e. in the hundreds, not millions - and it does help in security. With the right idioms in the codebase, it pretty much guarantees you don&#x27;t accidentally hand one tenant data belonging to a different tenant.<p>MySQL connections can be reused with database per tenant. Rack middleware (apartment gem) helps with managing applying migrations across all databases, and with the mechanics of configuring connections to use a tenant based on Host header as requests come in.<p>For async jobs in Java, allocating a connection can idiomatically only be done via a callback - e.g. `executeInTenantContext(Tenant tenant, Runnable block)` - which ensures that all connections handed out have the right tenant selected, and everything is reset to the default tenant (an empty database) when exiting.

Generally, ~1% of users were active at a given time, but a lot of resources were used for the 99% who were offline (eg, indexes in memory where 99% of the data wouldn’t be needed). Learned a few tricks. If this is the problem you&#x27;re trying to solve, some tips below.<p>Start by optimizing your indexes. Ensure customer_id is in every index and is the first item. This allows the query to immediately filter to only rows for this customer. Ensure all queries include a customer_id (should be doing this anyway in multi-tenant environment). Even single row lookups by primary key can be really sped up this way; once the index becomes bigger than memory it has to be paged in&#x2F;out. However with this approach the entire sub-tree of the index for “hot” users can remain in memory without paging, increasing cache hit rate, speeding up queries, and reducing IO.<p>The above is generally enough. However, some consumer apps have a ton of data per user and relatively low revenue per user. In this case there’s one more big trick to keep DB costs down: cluster the whole table by customer_id. Like the index problem, the row data can be inefficient. If your disk layout randomly places rows into pages, chances are there’s only one row for a given client on a given page. If you need to evaluate 1000 rows to do a a query, you’ll have to read close to 1000 pages, and IO is slow&#x2F;expensive. You’ll use a ton of memory caching pages where very few of the rows are for hot&#x2F;active users Note: this problem only really matters if your rows are small and you can fit many rows per page. To fix, cluster the table by customer_id. On MySQL+InnoDB this is easy (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dev.mysql.com&#x2F;doc&#x2F;refman&#x2F;5.7&#x2F;en&#x2F;innodb-index-types.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dev.mysql.com&#x2F;doc&#x2F;refman&#x2F;5.7&#x2F;en&#x2F;innodb-index-types.h...<\/a>). On Postgres there’s a CLUSTER command but it’s one time, locking and it will take forever; MySQL is the easier solution (and I really prefer Postgres). Lots of the NoSQL DBs allow you to control the physical layout. Once setup, your cache hit rates will go way up, total IO will go way down, and you&#x27;ll see a pretty good speedup.<p>As always, benchmark a lot for your use case before implementing (but don&#x27;t forget to benchmark the hot&#x2F;cold use cases).<p>PS — I remember a post a few days ago about a company running a distributed SQLite (many DBs).

(One complexity you can have is when a customer starts small but grows big – sometimes you might start out with just a small team at a large enterprise and then grow the account to enterprise scale – it can become necessary to design a mechanism to migrate a tenant from a multi-tenant instance into their own single-tenant instance.)"],"time":["2020-05-26 02:47:40"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["taylorcooney"],"id":[23306374],"kids":{},"parent":[23305111],"text":["There are definitely downsides to scaling out thousands of tenants - I&#x27;ve been told Heroku supports this, and at a glance I found this doc that says it may cause issues, <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;devcenter.heroku.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;heroku-postgresql#multiple-schemas\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;devcenter.heroku.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;heroku-postgresql#mult...<\/a> but it really doesn&#x27;t change whether you&#x27;re on Heroku or not.

Being a multi-tenant platform you want to keep the cost really low of signing up new accounts. The easiest way to run a typical SQL query in a distributed system without restrictions is to always access data scoped by the tenant. You can specify both the tenant_id and an object’s own ID for queries in your controller, so the coordinator can locate your data quickly.

That got real complicated really fast (Ruby is not meant to do systems programming stuff, and Octopus turned out very poorly maintained), and the project turned into a crazy rabbit hole with tons of debt we never could quite fix later. Over time, we replaced as many Ruby bits as we could with lower-level stuff, leveraging proxySQL as we could; the architecture should have been as low-level as possible from the get-go... I think Rails 6’s multi-DB mode was going to eventually help out too.<p>One fun piece of debt: after we had migrated all our major clients to their own shards, we started to work in parallel on making sure new clients would get their own shard too. We meant to just create the new shard on signup, but that’s when we found out, when you modify Octopus’s in-memory config of DBs, it replaces that config with a bulldozer, and interrupts all DB connections in flight. So, if you were doing stuff right when someone else signs up, your stuff would fail. We solved this by pre-allocating shards manually every month or so, triggering a manual blue-green deploy at the end of the process to gracefully refresh the config. It was tedious but worked great.<p>And of course, since it was a bunch of Active Record hacks, there’s a number of data-related features we couldn’t do because of the challenging architecture, and it was a constant effort to just keep it going through the constant bottlenecks we were meeting.

I&#x27;d worry less about Rails and tools, and more about the outcomes you need. If you have a smaller number of high value customers (big enterprises or regulated industries), or offer customers custom add-ons then it can be advantageous to give each customer their own database. Most of the HN audience will definitely not need this.<p>In some industries you&#x27;ll also have to fight with lawyers about being allowed to use a database shared between customers because their standard terms will start with this separation. This approach is helpful when you have to keep data inside the EU for customers based there. If you want to get creative, you can also use the approach to game SLAs by using it as the basis to split customers into &quot;pods&quot; and even if some of these are down you may not have a 100% outage and have to pay customers back.<p>This design imposes challenges with speed of development and maintenance. If you don&#x27;t know your requirements (think: almost any SaaS startup in the consumer or enterprise space) which is trying to find a niche, then following this approach is likely to add overhead which is inadvisable. The companies that can use this approach are going after an area they already know, and are prepared to go much more slowly than what most startup developers are used to.<p>Using row-level security or schemas are recommended for most SaaS&#x2F;startup scenarios since you don&#x27;t have N databases to update and keep in sync with every change. If you want to do any kind of split then you might consider a US&#x2F;EU split, if your customers need to keep data in the EU, but it&#x27;s best to consider this at the app-level since caches and other data stores start to become as important as your database when you have customers that need this.<p>Consideration should be given to URL design. When you put everything under yourapp.com&#x2F;customername it can become hard to split it later. Using URLs like yourapp.com&#x2F;invoice&#x2F;kfsdj28jj42 where &quot;kfsdj28jj42&quot; has an index for the database (or set of web servers, databases, and caches) encoded becomes easier to route.

The piece of mind that comes from some very hard walls preventing customer data from leaking is worth a few headaches.<p>A few takeaways:<p>- Older MySQL versions struggled to quickly create 100+ tables when a new trial was provisioned (on the order of a minute to create the DB + tables). We wanted this to happen in seconds, so we took to preprovisioning empty databases. This hasn&#x27;t been necessary in newer versions of MySQL.<p>- Thousands of DBs x 100s of tables x `innodb_file_per_table` does cause a bit of FS overhead and takes some tuning, especially around `table_open_cache`. It&#x27;s not insurmountable, but does require attention.<p>- We use discrete MySQL credentials per-customer to reduce the blast radius of a potential SQL injection. Others in this thread mentioned problems with connection pooling. We&#x27;ve never experienced trouble here. We do 10-20k requests &#x2F; minute.<p>- This setup doesn&#x27;t seem to play well with AWS RDS. We did some real-world testing on Aurora, and saw lousy performance when we got into the hundreds &#x2F; thousands of DBs. We&#x27;d observe slow memory leaks and eventual restarts. We run our own MySQL servers on EC2.<p>- We don&#x27;t split ALBs &#x2F; ASGs &#x2F; application servers per customer. It&#x27;s only the MySQL &#x2F; Solr layer which is multi-tenant. Memcache and worker queues are shared.<p>- We do a DB migration every few weeks. Like a single-tenant app would, we execute the migration under application code that can handle either version of the schema. Each database has a table like ActiveRecord&#x27;s migrations, to track all deltas. We have tooling to roll out a delta across all customer instances, monitor results.<p>- A fun bug to periodically track down is when one customer has an odd collection of data which changes cardinality in such a way that different indexes are used in a difficult query. In this case, we&#x27;re comparing `EXPLAIN` output from a known-good database against a poorly-performing database.<p>- This is managed by a pretty lightweight homegrown coordination application (&quot;Drops&quot;), which tracks customers &#x2F; usernames, and maps them to resources like database &amp; Solr.<p>- All of this makes it really easy to backup, archive, or snapshot a single customer&#x27;s data for local development."],"time":["2020-05-27 17:27:07"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["apapli"],"id":[23310909],"kids":{},"parent":[23305111],"text":["I recall ServiceNow use a single tenant model, not multitenant like most other SaaS apps.

Very large enterprise customers will get their own DB as a &quot;group of one&quot;, and &quot;groups&quot; of smaller customers will share a DB.  Certain groups will get more up-to-date software with more software version churn, likely a higher number of issues.  Other groups will get only rock-solid older versions with back-ported bug fixes ... both kinds of groups will then see benefits along a feature-to-stability curve.  Tenants who pay will get test tenants and a chance for those to be in a &quot;group&quot; that&#x27;s ahead, software-version-wise, of their normal formal tenant.<p>We do not generally want to fork the product for different versions or schemas or special features -- the goal instead is to roll upgrades through different groups so we have more time to react to issues.  We still want one single software version and data storage layout lineage.  This matches the Salesforce.com model, so we won&#x27;t need to deal with lots of different data migration histories, custom fields, etc. (I&#x27;m curious to see how long we stick with that).  (I realize SFDC is all about custom objects, fields, UIs, etc. ... but their underlying software is same for all tenants.  We also have some measure of customization, but within the same underlying DB layout that&#x27;s the same across all tenants.)<p>The backend tenants use is written largely in Java &#x2F; Spring with managed-RDBMS and other data-storage technologies from one of the big cloud vendors.  Orchestration is into a Kubernetes&#x2F;ISTIO environment provisioned from raw cloud-compute, not a managed service.  The coordinator between the managed storage-and-other services, Kubernetes&#x2F;ISTIO, the Docker backend-software registries, the secrets-managers, etc., is a custom Django REST Framework (DRF) server app that lets DevOps provision &quot;groups&quot;, attached to them fixed data resources (that don&#x27;t usually change from deployment-to-deployment) as well as periodically revised&#x2F;upgraded software resources (i.e., Docker containers with backend software).<p>The DRF server app&#x27;s main job is to let DevOps define the next-desired-state aka &quot;deployment&quot; for a &quot;group&quot; (upgrading one or more of the backend servers ... changing the provisioning parameters for a fixed resource ... etc.), and then the kick off a transition to that desired state.  Each such &quot;deployment&quot; reviews and validates once again all resource availability, credentials, secrets, etc. ... stopping along the way as appropriate for human verifications.  Each step is done within a Django transaction, leading from &quot;old deployment&quot; to &quot;new deployment&quot;.  Any failure in any step (after an appropriate number of retries) leads to a rollback to the previous deployment state.  There&#x27;s only one low-level step whose failure would lead to an undetermined &quot;emergency&quot; state getting stuck &quot;between deployments&quot;, and that&#x27;s very unlikely to fail since by that point all elements needed for the crucial &quot;switch&quot; in upgraded software have been touched multiple times such that failure at that point is real unlikely.  There&#x27;s a fairly straightforward recovery from that state as well, after human intervention.<p>We chose this custom method because there are so many elements in so many different infrastructures to verify and tie together that wrapping all the operations in transaction-mediated Python made sense, plus the Python APIs for all infrastructure elements a very good, and mostly involve sending&#x2F;receiving&#x2F;inspecting JSON or JSON-like data.  There&#x27;s plenty of logging, and plenty of side-data stored as JSON blobs in DB records for proper diagnosis and accounting when things to go wrong.  Groups can have their software upgraded without impact to other groups in the system.  Another advantage is that as the &quot;architecture&quot; or &quot;shape&quot; of data and software resources attached to a &quot;group&quot; changes (changes to how configuration is done; introduction of a new backend service; introduction of a new datastore), the DRF server app can seamlessly transition the group from the old to the new shape (after software revision to make the DRF server app aware of what those changes are).<p>The DRF server app itself is easy to upgrade, and breaking changes can be resolved by an entire parallel deployment of the DRF server app and all the &quot;groups&quot; using the same per-group backend datastores .. the new deployment listens on a &quot;future&quot; form of all tenant URLs.  At switchover time the pre-existing DRF server app&#x27;s tenant URLs get switched to an &quot;past&quot; form, the new DRF server app&#x27;s groups tenant URLs get switched.<p>In any case, these are some of the advantages of the approach.  The main takeaways so far have been:<p><pre><code>  - there was major commitment to building this infrastructure, it hasn&#x27;t been easy\n\n  - controlled definition of &quot;groups&quot; and upgrades to &quot;groups&quot; are very important, we want to avoid downtime\n\n  - Kubernetes and ISTIO are great platforms for hosting these apps -- the topology of what a &quot;group&quot; and its tenants look like is a bit complicated but the infrastructure works well\n\n  - giving things a unique-enough name is crucial ... as a result we&#x27;re able to deploy multiple such constellations of fake-groups-of-tenants in development&#x2F;test environments, each constellation managed by a DRF server\n\n  - the DRF will host an ever-growing set of services related to monitoring and servicing the &quot;groups&quot; -- mostly it can be a single-source-of-data with links to appropriate consoles in Kibana, Grafana, cloud-provider infrastructure, etc.,\n<\/code><\/pre>\nWe&#x27;re still early in the use but so far so good."],"time":["2020-05-26 05:37:51"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["tyingq"],"id":[23306714],"kids":{},"parent":[23305111],"text":["Not an app per se, but old school shared hosting does this.

It worked extremely well, though it wasn&#x27;t without its drawbacks. They adopted the database-per-tenant pattern in the early &#x27;00s, and I truly think it was one of the major things that allowed them to scale to a large number of (increasingly larger in data&#x2F;access patterns) clients. It also made regulatory compliance a bit easier (everyone&#x27;s data is pretty firewalled off at the database-access-credentials layer) I think, but that wasn&#x27;t really my department.<p>We ended up in the &quot;thousands to tens of thousands&quot; of clients range, with thousands of tables per client and a pretty hairy schema.<p>Each customer had their own schema on one of a few dozen giant database servers. The company pushed this idea out to other parts of their infrastructure: separate webserver&#x2F;message broker&#x2F;cache tiers existed for each underlying database server, so outages or brownouts in one component couldn&#x27;t affect other customers&#x27; data that much.<p>Schema migrations, interestingly, weren&#x27;t much of a problem. The practice was nailed down early of &quot;everyone gets migrated during a release, no snowflakes&quot;. That, plus some pretty paranoid tooling and an acceptable-downtime (well, on paper it wasn&#x27;t acceptable, but everyone kinda understood that it was) in seconds-to-minutes during a release made migrations roughly as traumatic as migrations anywhere I&#x27;ve worked (which is to say, &quot;somewhat&quot;), but not too much more. It did take a lot of work to get the tooling right across multiple schemas in the same database server though. Investment in tooling--up to and including dedicated teams working on a single tool without a break-up date or firm mandate other than &quot;make this not suck and keep the lights on&quot;--is critical here, as in most areas.<p>Things that were hard:<p>- Connection management. Others on this thread have pointed that out. Connection pooling and long-lived queue workers were essential, and the web&#x2F;request tier couldn&#x27;t &quot;scale out&quot; too far without hitting connection limits. Scheduled jobs (and this company <i>loved<\/i> cron jobs, thousands of distinct invocations per tenant) were a problem in the connection-management department. Carefully written tooling around webserver connection reuse, cron-job execution harnesses (they didn&#x27;t really run as cron jobs, they got shipped to a worker already running the code with warm&#x2F;spare database connections and run there--all highly custom), and asynchronous jobs was needed. That occupied a team or three for awhile.<p>- The &quot;whale&quot; problem. When an individual tenant got big enough to start crowding out others on the same database server, it caused performance problems. We eventually worked on a migration tool that moved a client&#x27;s entire footprint (and remember, this isn&#x27;t just databases, but webs&#x2F;caches&#x2F;queue worker hosts&#x2F;etc.) onto another shard. Building this tool was a lot of work, but when it was done it worked surprisingly well. My advice in this area: build a good manually-initiated&#x2F;semi-supervised migration system. Leverage underlying database technology (binlog based replication). Don&#x27;t hesitate to get very dirty and custom with e.g. replication logfile formats, and don&#x27;t assume that $off_the_shelf_data_replicator isn&#x27;t gonna collapse when you want to do online per-schema replication in massive parallel from the same database (not even if that tool cost you millions of dollars). Do <i>NOT<\/i> succumb to the allure of &quot;we can automate the bin-packing and it&#x27;ll constantly rearrange clients&#x27; datasets for optimal resource usage!&quot; Manual is just fine for data migrations that big. Worst case, part of someone&#x27;s job is to initiate&#x2F;supervise them.<p>- SPOFs sucked. Some datasets weren&#x27;t per-tenant at all; sometimes client companies merged together or split up; some data arrived intended for a tenant but wasn&#x27;t tagged with that tenant&#x27;s ID, so it would have to go into some separate database before it found a home. These systems were, bar none, the biggest liabilities, causes of production issues, and hardest things to code around in the entire company. You&#x27;d think that having to write application code for thousands of logical databases across all the per-tenant schemas would suck, but in reality it wasn&#x27;t too hard. It was making sure your code didn&#x27;t accidentally talk to a SPOF that was the problem. My advice here: microservices do not help with this problem. HTTP, gRPC, or raw database wire protocol: if you have dependencies on a &quot;tragedy of the commons&quot;-type used-by-everyone server sneaking into your nicely sliced up per-tenant architecture, those callsites are going to be the cause of your sleepless nights. Get good visibility into where they occur. Favor &quot;push&quot; into per-tenant models over per-tenant code doing a blocking &quot;pull&quot;. Even if the push approach causes massive additional complexity and work. The costs of pull are too great.<p>- Some database specific shit (even on polished hosted offerings from AWS, or big-budget Oracle installs) will start acting really squirrely when you&#x27;re talking to thousands of identical schemas on the same database server (and thus tens or hundreds of thousands of identical tables with different data). If you double down on this route, be prepared to have a few really, really good database folks on staff. I don&#x27;t mean &quot;help me fix my slow giant reporting query&quot; people, I mean &quot;familiar with the internals&quot; folks. Example: query plans can be cached based on query <i>text<\/i>, globally, across an entire database server. Different schemas have <i>super<\/i> different clients, and thus super different data distribution among 100s of GBs of data. The plan that gets cached for query X against client A is the product of running heuristics&#x2F;histograms&#x2F;etc. across client A&#x27;s data. That plan might perform pathologically when query X runs against client B (on the same database server)&#x27;s data, and finding out how&#x2F;why is really annoying. Solution: bust the cache by a) happening to know that SQL comments aren&#x27;t stripped from query texts before the text is used as a plan-cache key and b) prepend each tenant&#x27;s identifier to each query at the database-driver level to prevent cache pollution. Result: you have traded a spooky query performance issue for a query-plan-cache-size issue; now your queries are all predictably slow because all your tenants&#x27; different queries are thrashing the plan cache. Tradeoffs abound."],"time":["2020-05-26 14:12:37"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["zaroth"],"id":[23306902],"kids":{},"parent":[23305111],"text":["I’ve done this at several companies.

Don’t ever store any site specific information other than the name&#x2F;ID of the site in the Hosting database - because it could get out of sync when you restore a site backup, or if you have to restore a Hosting backup.<p>Ideally you would want to make schema changes always backward compatible, as in an old version of the code can always run fine against a newer schema. So, e.g. new columns are always nullable, as are new parameters to stored procedures. This has been a very useful property a number of times during deployments when you can switch the app binaries around without worrying about schema rollbacks.<p>You’ll of course need to script the database setup&#x2F;creation process, so you can click a button to bring up a new site&#x2F;customer&#x2F;tenant. As much as possible don’t ever touch the database by hand, and if you follow this rule from the start you will stay in a sane happy place without much overhead at all.<p>I’ve done this with up to 4-figure number of databases and it’s served me just fine. There were many times that certain customers would get ahead in the schema and then later everyone would catch up as new code rolled out.<p>I think it would be a heck of a lot scarier doing DB operations if it was all a single database. For example, you’ll have a new customer who is using a new feature which you are beta testing with them. Easy to have just their database ahead of the mainline, and make any fixes there as you go, and then deploy the final GA schema worldwide.<p>The only cardinal rule I always followed was that a single binary had to work for all customers. I would not want to cross the line into customer-specific code branches at practically any cost. There were certainly feature flags that were only enabled for single customers, but ultimately every site could run on the same binaries and indeed the same app farm.<p>It’s particular useful to be able to backup&#x2F;restore easily on a per-customer basis, and to be able to pull in just one customer DB into dev to reproduce the issue - without needing to pull everything over.<p>Not with Rails but with SQL Server and C#&#x2F;ASP.NET. In this case it’s easy to setup so that the domain name would map to a database connection string at a very low level of the code. Everything above would have no concept of what site it was operating on. You never had to worry about writing any kind of code to isolate sites except for one thing — mixing the domain name into the session token so that a malicious user couldn’t try to reuse a session from another domain. Because of course it’s all the same set of app servers on the front-end."],"time":["2020-05-26 04:27:12"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["PunksATawnyFill"],"id":[23308115],"kids":{},"parent":[23305111],"text":["1 decibel per account?<p>What does that even mean?"],"time":["2020-05-26 08:40:53"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["lalu555"],"id":[23309477],"kids":{},"parent":[23305111],"text":["Vagina has her own mechanisms, how to operates vaginal discharge how to maintain vaginal PH balance, or ingrown yeast for the safety of the vagina."],"time":["2020-05-26 12:48:42"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["qchris"],"id":[23313413],"kids":[23314453,23314544],"parent":[23312259],"text":["I&#x27;m a huge fan of this kind of practice, where the code for a paper is all located in a single public repository with build instructions, along with directions for how to cite it.

This omnipresent cult of the body is extraordinary. It is the only object on which everyone is made to concentrate, not as a source of pleasure, but as an object of frantic concern, in the obsessive fear of failure or substandard performance, a sign and an anticipation of death, that death to which no one can any longer give a meaning, but which everyone knows has at all times to be prevented. The body is cherished in the perverse certainty of its uselessness, in the total certainty of its non-resurrection. Now, pleasure is an effect of the resurrection of the body, by which it exceeds that hormonal, vascular and dietetic equilibrium in which we seek to imprison it, that exorcism by fitness and hygiene. So the body has to be made to forget pleasure as present grace, to forget its possible metamorphosis into other forms of appearance and become dedicated to the Utopian preservation of a youth that is, in any case, already lost. For the body which doubts its own existence is already half-dead, and the current semi-yogic, semi-ecstatic cult of the body is a morbid preoccupation. The care taken of the body while it is alive prefigures the way it will be made up in the funeral home, where it will be given a smile that is really ‘into’ death.&quot;<\/i>"],"time":["2020-05-26 23:32:31"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mellosouls"],"id":[23315698],"kids":[23317332],"parent":[23314485],"text":["It isn&#x27;t mentioned in the blog as far as I can see but the author appears to be advocating &quot;micro habits&quot; (also known under similar and other monikers, small habits, BJ Fogg&#x27;s method etc).<p>The idea being you pick up a new habit using similar techniques to pomodoro, a little bit at a time.<p>Example of similar reflections:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hackernoon.com&#x2F;micro-habits-changed-my-life-47f572bfc153\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hackernoon.com&#x2F;micro-habits-changed-my-life-47f572bf...<\/a><p>One thing I did find useful in this particular essay (the OP) was a reminder of the relative difficulty of spending X amount of time doing something new compared to the same amount of time doing something second nature - which is magnified further according to how boring, painful, or just plain irritating it is."],"time":["2020-05-26 21:54:28"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["epinards"],"id":[23314486],"kids":[23315592],"parent":[23314485],"text":["I recently got my life together and wanted to share what&#x27;s been working for me."],"time":["2020-05-26 20:11:49"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["kosmischemusik"],"id":[23315405],"kids":[23316060,23315645,23316406],"parent":[23314485],"text":["I&#x27;ve been trying to build habits forever.

Now, programs like Mathematica can do much harder, more complex integrals.<p>Professor Patrick Winston pointed out that most of the AI programs we were going to look at in his class (chess, natural language, 3D vision in block world, etc.) ended up, like integration, as simple code plus a database of facts.<p>Back then, there was general optimism about the future of AI. No one anticipated how slow progress would be while the capabilities of the hardware grew a million-fold.<p>The work referenced in the article is interesting. It appears to be another small step in advancing AI. It&#x27;s a small, but difficult, step like almost every other advance in AI, and I admire the work done by those working in this field.<p>The problems of solving simple differential equations and symbolic integration at the first year calculus level are not really advanced math. Humans solve these problems with a relatively small bag of tricks that transform a symbolic integral into a simpler form. A program can do the same thing with an even more detailed database of transforms that can be attempted at each point in the search tree until a simple solution is reached.<p>The article claims that the new program can solve difficult integrals. This is interesting because hard to solve integrals are often associated with real physical phenomena. See for example the triple integrals of W. F. van Peype which arose while he was studying magnetism in different materials. These, relatively, plain looking definite integrals stumped some of the world&#x27;s most famous mathematicians.

But the full algorithm (the Risch algorithm) is about 100 pages long and has never been fully implemented.

A &quot;super app&quot; seems to be another way to provide that consolidation, but is there more to it than indexing?<p>A user is basically having a chat with their device. The UI is the language available for the user to form queries. The more flexible the language, the more the user may express complex queries. But users don&#x27;t really want to learn a complex language, they want something either &quot;intuitive&quot; or matching their interests from the beginning (ie, opening up the search possibilities, or narrowing down to a usable set of targets). Because intuition is only made from analogies of accumulated knowledge, the former can only be constructed by having the app capable of understanding (possibly a subset of) the user language, which leads to Siri and the like. The later by reducing the scope of the super app to a template of interests, which could either fixed (mainstream topics), or determined from a set of existing models by having the user go through a questionnaire at app install to narrow down their interests to a manageable subset.<p>I think that for now the key factors are:<p>(1) consolidation of information, because the user doesn&#x27;t want to jump through each of their accounts or data sources to find what their looking for.<p>(2) automatic connection of different services (banking, online markets, and perhaps many other use cases); this is only relevant for services which are not equipped with a protocol to deal with a given form of connectivity.

That seems a reasonable approach.<p>For KS, from the author&#x27;s perspective this is ultra-high-risk.  Their book isn&#x27;t even on store shelves yet, and yet they&#x27;re selling DRM-unencumbered copies.  Meanwhile if I want to buy a 60-year-old book that&#x27;s obviously available on every pirate site, the seller will still foist DRM onto me.<p>So I think we&#x27;re getting there.
