Here are some general tips.<p>* Keep them separated. Never have work on your personal devices. Have a work phone and a personal phone. Have a work computer and a personal computer.<p>* Have a place to work. My SO and I have a dedicated office. If you don&#x27;t have one, make a space somewhere that you can work at and work there consistently.<p>* Keep a schedule. This is tough. I&#x27;m several TZ away, so sometimes there are meetings at 9pm my time.  I generally get a pass on those. But if I have to attend, I make up the time somewhere the rest of the week. I&#x27;ll use that time to bank, clean, errands, etc. Generally, though, I can stay 8-5.  I love having nearly half my day all to myself to do thought work before anyone else starts working.<p>* Have a daily transition plan. This allows you to transition into work and transition out of work. I usually leave an open task for me to start first thing in the morning. That helps me transition into my work day. For transitioning out, I am the chef of the family, so at 5 I start prepping the kitchen.<p>* Set boundaries. Don&#x27;t let people expect you to be accessible all the time. During specified work hours, yes. But not all the time.  Also, set boundaries with family. They&#x27;re not allowed to take advantage of the fact that you work from home by asking you to run all the errands, do the laundry, make the calls, etc. This isn&#x27;t a problem I have ever had, but some people I know do have it and well, it makes for stress and nobody needs more of that."],"time":["2020-08-18 20:02:31"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["hotgeart"],"id":[24196728],"kids":[24197367],"parent":[24196433],"text":["I&#x27;ve two PCs (one work and one personnal).<p>At 5PM my work day is over and I go for a walk (4-5 km).

You&#x27;ll probably note a theme of &quot;boundaries&quot;.  This isn&#x27;t all that different conceptually from setting healthy boundaries in order to maintain a work&#x2F;life balance in normal office-going times, but some of the specifics can change when you&#x27;re working and living in the same space.<p>* Have a separate computer for work and personal stuff.  Don&#x27;t have your work email&#x2F;Slack&#x2F;whatever signed in and loaded on your personal computer.<p>* Delete work apps&#x2F;accounts (Slack, work email) from your phone.  Especially now since you&#x27;re home nearly all the time, you don&#x27;t need them on your phone anyway.  If you&#x27;re signed into any web apps on your phone, sign out of them.<p>* Set yourself time limits.  You work between X:00 and Y:00 every day.  When Y:00 comes, you shut down the work computer and do something else.  If this is too inflexible, set yourself a 30-60 minute range, and when you hit the beginning of that range -- set an alarm if you need it -- be mindful of what you&#x27;re working on and make sure you can wind it down by the end of the time period.  You can also try to schedule phone&#x2F;video calls or other socially-distant activities for right around your stop time to force you to stop and get into another mindset.<p>* When work is done, put everything work-related away.  If you tend to keep paper notes or use a whiteboard, find a place to put them so you can&#x27;t see them.<p>* When you stop working, go outside and go for a walk.  It doesn&#x27;t have to be long; just 30 or even 15 minutes is fine.  Don&#x27;t be on your phone while you walk.  Just walk around outside and take in the atmosphere.  (Obviously if you are in a COVID-vulnerable group, be careful, and don&#x27;t go out if you don&#x27;t feel comfortable with it.)<p>* Wear different clothes when you&#x27;re working vs. not.<p>* I get that you have a relatively small space overall, but if you can keep a consistent work area (that you don&#x27;t generally use for other non-work things all that much), try to keep to your workspace while working, and keep out of it while not working.<p>* In your free time, adopt activities that occupy your mind.  Whether that&#x27;s reading a book, learning a language, or whatever, it&#x27;s up to you.  Mindless web browsing will make it easy for your brain to drift back to work, but if you&#x27;re doing something mentally engaging, it&#x27;s more likely work thoughts won&#x27;t intrude."],"time":["2020-08-18 22:57:59"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["apapli"],"id":[24196825],"kids":{},"parent":[24196433],"text":["Put on an old James Bond movie from the 60s and let my mind slow down a bit once I’ve done all my family and household duties.<p>Or fire up flight simulator 2020, which has just been released and explore some amazing place from the air."],"time":["2020-08-18 11:42:51"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ringe"],"id":[24203282],"kids":{},"parent":[24196433],"text":["Ah,I replace the siding of the house, after adding more insulation.

Start your day by going out of the house - walk the dog, collect a newspaper, watch the sunrise, do some exercise.<p>2.  When you return, shower and change into &quot;work&quot; clothes.  Perhaps these are smarter than home clothes. Maybe a light shirt or collared t-shirt with some trousers. Wear the same as if you were meeting your boss (or their boss!).

The old adage &quot;out of sight, out of mind&quot; is very important when living in the same area as your &quot;office&quot;.

Which makes many suspect widespread overconfidence in claims about what we know can’t be there, because if so we would have seen them already.&quot;<\/i><p>Hanson here appears to be backing up his claim with three hyperlinks. One thing that troubles me about rationalist-affiliated writing is that it tends to rest on what <i>looks<\/i>, at first glance, like a decent evidence base, but this evidence often breaks down under a little scrutiny. \nFor example:<p>• Hanson&#x27;s first link is to a recent <i>National Geographic<\/i> article that summarizes an archaeology finding from Bronze Age China. The summary is, IMO, misleading in one key respect. It calls the find &quot;astonishing&quot; because &quot;parts&quot; of the site &quot;date back 4,300 years, nearly 2,000 years before the oldest section of the Great Wall—and 500 years before Chinese civilization took root on the Central Plains.&quot; The Great Wall reference is a non sequitur: it&#x27;s a bit like saying that a find from the Old Kingdom of Egypt is astonishing because it dates back to two thousand years before the building of a Roman aqueduct. There&#x27;s no real connection, and it&#x27;s not at all news that agricultural civilizations existed in China circa 2300 BCE. Whether we want to call these societies &quot;Chinese civilization&quot; or not is debatable. But this finding, while really interesting and cool, is very different from what Hanson seems to be reading it as -- which is to say, as evidence for the belief that future discoveries might yield signs of &quot;advanced civilizations&quot; which <i>far predate<\/i> the Bronze Age as it&#x27;s currently imagined. After all, in 2300 BCE, written records and urbanized societies already existed in a fairly large swathe of Eurasia.<p>• His second link is simply to the Wikipedia page for Göbekli Tepe. Which is a totally fascinating site, I agree. It certainly does have unique features, such as the megalithic carvings. But again, it is <i>not<\/i> evidence of an entirely unknown &quot;advanced&quot; civilization; instead, the people who built Göbekli Tepe clearly fit into the existing archaeological record relating to the Neolithic Near East. We&#x27;ve known for some time that early agricultural societies were emerging in the fertile crescent around the same time as this site. What&#x27;s fascinating about this site is that it appears to predate agriculture in the region. However, it <i>is<\/i> thought to fit into a transitional stage (&quot;Recent DNA analysis of modern domesticated wheat compared with wild wheat has shown that its DNA is closest in sequence to wild wheat found on Karaca Dag 30 km [20 mi] away from the site, suggesting that this is where modern wheat was first domesticated&quot;). So again, IMO this has nothing to do with his claim about &quot;lost&quot; civilizations which don&#x27;t fit into our existing chronology.<p>• The final link is to a <i>Nature<\/i> write-up from two years ago relating to a contested claim about when humans arrived in the Americas. Again, this has nothing to do with evidence for an &quot;advanced civilization&quot; that has previously not been discovered.<p>All three of these links reference really interesting and important work which I very much hope continues to be funded and elaborated on. I&#x27;m convinced that there are incredible mysteries in store in the future, especially in the field of underwater archaeology. Yet to my reading, none of these reports relate to phenomena that scholars &quot;confidently predicted would never be found.&quot; Any archaeologist or historian with a sense of humility will gladly admit that there are a huge number of unknowns in the historical record. None of this can be leveraged as a basis for the existence of &quot;lost advanced civilizations&quot; (by which he appears to mean agricultural or otherwise technologically-advanced civilization that far predate the Agricultural Revolution as its currently understood, and which were forgotten after some kind of hypothetical period of decline).<p>For that, you need what Hanson waves away: actual archaeological or historical evidence."],"time":["2020-08-18 22:34:17"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["baddox"],"id":[24204036],"kids":[24206777],"parent":[24202308],"text":["&gt; Here the key question here is: what sort of things should you expect to have already seen, if they were really there? On the one hand, we clearly have seen enough to safely conclude that there aren’t large dinosaurs roaming the streets in our major city centers.

Which makes many suspect widespread overconfidence in claims about what we know can’t be there, because if so we would have seen them already.<p>This wording is very reminiscent of a lot of writing from conspiracy theorists.

Yes, we have in the past uncovered real substantial government conspiracies and attempted cover-ups.

Kotlin was designed in 2009-10, in the Java 7 days, around the time of the Oracle acquisition, and at a time of stagnation for Java due to Sun&#x27;s decline. At the time, Android was also quite similar to Java. Kotlin was a great design in those conditions. Things are very different today.<p>Kotlin&#x27;s design goals are now contradictory. It seeks to be a low-overhead language, i.e. provide abstractions that don&#x27;t add overhead over the target platform, give access to all platform capabilities, and at the same time target multiple platforms -- Java, Android, LLVM and JS -- over <i>none of which<\/i> does Kotlin exert much influence (maybe a bit on Android). Since 2010, Java has moved away from Android, to the point that there are very big gaps between the two, and they&#x27;re only growing.<p>By both trying to target multiple platforms (with no say in their design) and trying to add little or no overhead, Kotlin will soon find itself in a bind. It&#x27;s coroutines are in conflict with Java&#x27;s upcoming virtual thread&#x27;s design, and its inline classes will cause problems with Java&#x27;s Valhalla vs. Android. Kotlin will have to choose to either give up on low-overhead abstractions, give up on some of its platforms, give up on giving access to full platform capabilities, or split into multiple languages, each targeting a different platform. For example, if Kotlin&#x27;s inline types will make use of Valhalla, then they won&#x27;t work on Android, at least not without much overhead.<p>TL;DR: A full-capability, low-overhead, multi-platform language is hard to pull off in the long run when you have low market share on all of those platforms (except Android) and little or no influence on any of them.

In particular, I&#x27;ve been working on a multiplatform project recently which definitely have helped me learn about some of the less developed parts of the language.<p>Long ago, I used to do a lot of Java and I liked it a lot (having worked at Sun back around 2000 was certainly part of the reason). Kotlin, in my opinion, is a better Java. It does a pretty good job of providing a nice syntax for it, and these benefits are the first things that are explained in beginners tutorials to Kotlin.<p>But, it doesn&#x27;t really do anything new. There are so many things it could do to fix long-standing problems with Java, which Jetbrains refuse to implement due to the fact that the implementation will not be natural to the JVM.<p>An obvious example is generic functions, or multimethods. This was discussed on the forums, but quickly dismissed with one of the main reasons being that it would have to introduce a new dispatch mechanism and so wouldn&#x27;t be natural on the JVM. This argument has been made to dismiss many suggested features.<p>Another reason Jetbrains uses dismiss suggestions is that the new feature would make the language more complicated and difficult to learn. The refusal to implement some kind of macro facility falls into this category.<p>At the same time, this position leads to truly bizarre language behaviour such as the strange behaviour where declaring a function inline changes the semantics of the code.<p>This insistence that the JVM dictate the features makes even less sense since they also have native as well as JS code generators.<p>The only unique Kotlin feature that I can think of which is not a result of the JVM is their support for suspending functions, which is used to implement their async framework. The problem here is that it semantics can be really confusing, and can in fact lead to deadlocks if you have a library the needs to be exposed to Java which internally is implemented using suspending functions. If these functions are then called by Kotlin code which itself use suspending functions, you can end up with really strange behaviour."],"time":["2020-08-19 13:14:57"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mancini0"],"id":[24199008],"kids":{},"parent":[24196057],"text":["I love it.

Sell me a switch.<p>Apple: We don&#x27;t sell switches.<p>Me: Why not?<p>Apple: (After pause) It&#x27;s only an $80 mouse. Not worth it.<p>&quot;Only.&quot; That&#x27;s $135 in today&#x27;s money. (A better mouse now sells for $7.) I should let Apple charge me $135 to replace a microswitch?<p>You could just watch it going south. It all started when the Mac came out. (The slim II manual had peeks and pokes in it. They actually supported hobbyists and learners.) The Mac dox (think it was 3 huge volumes) had huge lists of names of calls you could make. Just names. Soon the rainbow apple turned to a chrome apple.<p>My next &#x27;Mac&#x27; came from Power Computing. Yeah, Apple slipped up and put a gate in the walled garden for a couple years. It worked great for 7 years. At 160MHz.<p>Software got SO much better. So, yeah, I slipped up and got an iMac -- cost me twice what a similar PC would. (But all my music software was for PPC and hardware used serial ports.) That iMac burned me in multiple ways.<p>I thought all that was horrible. Those times were gentle compared to today.

The resulting multilingual sentence embeddings improve average bi-text retrieval accuracy over 112 languages to 83.7%, well above the 65.5% achieved by the prior state-of-the-art on Tatoeba. Our sentence embeddings also establish new state-of-the-art results on BUCC and UN bi-text retrieval.&quot;<p>(Found via <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tfhub.dev&#x2F;google&#x2F;LaBSE&#x2F;1\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tfhub.dev&#x2F;google&#x2F;LaBSE&#x2F;1<\/a>)"],"time":["2020-08-19 04:03:45"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["lacker"],"id":[24204055],"kids":[24204194,24206342,24206223],"parent":[24203495],"text":["After all the attention OpenAI got for making the GPT-3 API semi-publicly-available, I wonder if Google has considered making some of their research models available via API.

There have been some deeply shameful moments... the researcher in another department who went out of her way to engage with me, until I mistook her for somebody else for an entire elevator ride. The student I ran into downtown who was hurt because his prof couldn&#x27;t recall basic details of his project - I literally did not know who he was on account of his bike helmet, despite having in him in class not even a day before.

Tech conferences are the worst.<p>Assuming we ever get to work in close quarters again, try guessing at the identity of your co-workers from behind. Almost always you&#x27;ll be positive whom you&#x27;re looking at. But not every time. For most people, it would be enough for the subject to turn around and provide a clear view of their face.

I only learned what to call it about 5 years ago. But it is not total and complete. I recognize faces when I see someone I know where I have seen them before. But if I see someone I know in a new location I have never seen them, I do not initially recognize them. But as soon as they speak to me, and I hear their voice, suddenly I recognize them. One of my earliest memories when I was in elementary school, first grade, is being with my mother at the Kmart. I was upset because I wanted to go home, and she had this long conversation with someone, seemed like almost an hour, which I found excrutiating. I did not know who she was talking to. When we left, I complained, &quot;who was that person?&quot; My mother gasped, &quot;catmistake! [not my real name] That was your homeroom teacher! You see her every morning in school!&quot; I could not believe it. I knew this woman well. I think I may have been in love with her. Just recently, in a gas station I see this guy shaking hands with someone else, not 6 feet away, full view. He looked interesting, but I didn&#x27;t know him until he walked up to me, &quot;hey catmistake.&quot; It was my friend that I was staying with for the previous two months, knew for 20 years, that I had just seen about a half hour before at his house. It is freaky, going from seeing someone as a complete stranger and then suddenly recognizing them. It is difficult to explain the transition. I had balance problems as a child, and fell down the hardwood stairs on my head nearly every day until I figured out how to lean back when stepping forward. So I think it is permanent brain damage causing it. Doesn&#x27;t get me down, but I have been abused for it, &quot;friends,&quot; that are aware of it, know when to expect it, and screwing with me.

For example, something that has been tripping us up lately is that our Twitter integration relies (partially) upon the official t.co link shortener[2], and yet, due to modern browser rules related to W3C Referrer Policy[3], the t.co link&#x27;s path segment is often not transmitted to the analytics provider, and thus the source tweet for traffic cannot be easily ascertained.<p>I firmly believe in privacy and analytics without compromise[4], so the team is trying to come up with ways to at least quantify shadow traffic at an aggregate level, and to ensure legitimate user privacy interests are honored, while making sure they don&#x27;t break legitimate privacy-safe first-party analytics use cases.<p>As a developer, something that concerned me recently was realizing that Sentry, the open source error tracking tool with a SaaS reporting frontend and a JavaScript SDK[5], gets blocked in many conservative  browser privacy setups.

Attribution is the big, thorny problem in _all_ of advertising e.g. how do you know if Customer A saw Ad B and that they then went on to buy Product C.<p>In my experience this type of tech has two goals:<p>The first is measuring distribution with aggregate data about how many people saw the ad and when, then combining this with ethnographic data about the location (e.g. what proportion of people in this area fall into income bracket Y). This looks like &quot;1,293 people have seen your ad in the last 60 minutes and here some demographic information about them&quot;. This is done with video and gait tracking, or radar&#x2F;lidar for measuring volumes and people who &#x27;engage&#x27; with the ad by lookijng at it for &gt;N $TIME.<p>This is all perfectly possible and scalable and is what ClearChannel are currently doing, the product trick is to make it &#x27;real-time&#x27; so advertisers can adjust their buys and unit distribution more flexibly when combined with digital signage (e.g. I&#x27;m going to move our ad from this unit in this location to this other unit in this other location in &#x27;real-time&#x27; as there&#x27;s more high net worth people there today). This also nicely ups outdoor spend (people use it more, it appears more sticky) but they also charge more for these more &#x27;dynamic&#x27; outdoor units. There&#x27;s a bunch of seriously dubious data the the publishers use to justify this new way of buying outdoor.<p>The second (and WAY worse one) is doing direct attribution (e.g. Did consumer sKIFW3890 see ad sdoflij0934r and then did they buy product 029w3r29 from merchant 203ei2-309ir). This has been the holy grail of outdoor for a decade but no one&#x27;s been able to make it work. ClearChannel very clearly WANT to do it, which is creepy as all hell, but in my reading between the lines (and working in the industry a little) I don&#x27;t _think_ this is what their Radar solution delivers, at the moment.

It&#x27;s so bad that you simply can&#x27;t be outside around sunrise&#x2F;sunset without taking the necessary precautions. We now have a division within the pest control authority that deals specifically with tracking and eradicating them.<p>Two years ago I moved to Southern France only to find it&#x27;s the exact same story.<p>We&#x27;re dealing with an airborne virus pandemic now, but I can easily imagine the day when the Global North is dealing with the same mosquito-borne diseases that decimate parts of Africa and Asia."],"time":["2020-08-18 09:37:26"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["baq"],"id":[24196720],"kids":[24197010],"parent":[24186546],"text":["These bastards are all over Southern Europe nowadays.

People are different all over, they&#x27;re not the same, so they don&#x27;t all want the same thing.<p>I stopped listening to the BBC World Service when it stopped being about Britain and started being &quot;The world&#x27;s radio station™,&quot; because it just got boring and repetitive.<p>&quot;Centralcasting&quot; is what almost killed radio in America the 1990&#x27;s. Jacor&#x2F;Clear Channel ate hundreds of stations across the country and had a computer in Kentucky decide what music should be played for an entire nation.  It didn&#x27;t work.  People flocked to iPods and streaming to get away from the homogeny. Those stations that kept true to their local content survived, and some thrived.<p>Even Sirius learned this with its satellite radio stations, and the DJs no longer pretend to be some monolithic continental presence in the sky, and instead talk about wherever they&#x27;re broadcasting from, and some even bend the playlist to match their geography, so it changes through the day as they switch from a host in Detroit to one in Boston to one in DC to one in L.A.  When I was in broadcasting it was called a POD — Point Of Difference.  Why can DJ A give me that DJ B can&#x27;t?<p>KCSN&#x2F;Northidge and WXRT&#x2F;Chicago are both AAA radio stations, but they don&#x27;t play the same songs.

Apple Global Mega Huge Music One has no local audience, and zero feedback other than a subscriber count.<p>When I listen to a pop station in London, I hear different music than when I listen to a pop station in Los Angeles or Melbourne.  That&#x27;s good.  I listen to music from stations all over the world, and in genres I don&#x27;t ordinarily like, simply because I enjoy the discovery of new songs and artists that I never heard of.<p>Apple has enough money to keep this online for a very long time, even if no one listens.

To eliminate the virus, China tested all 11 million residents of Wuhan for coronavirus in just 14 days [1]. That&#x27;s more than 500,000 people per day. Dozens of asymptomatic carriers were found, who were then quarantined. Wuhan hasn&#x27;t had new cases in weeks.<p>China used a similar mass testing strategy in Beijing. When an outbreak appeared at the Xinfadi wholesale market in June [2], the government had a short (several weeks long) lockdown and tested more than half the city&#x27;s population. Some days they did ~400,000 tests per day [3]. This was possible because they sent in testing resources from across the country to Beijing. The outbreak was eliminated within a month.<p>I believe mass testing is an effective way to reign in the coronavirus.

Although Rand would not agree with the following examples, I&#x27;ve become convinced that the terms &quot;capitalism&quot; and &quot;socialism&quot; are really anti-concepts of the package-deal variety.<p>&quot;Libertarians sometimes debate whether the &quot;real&quot; or &quot;authentic&quot; meaning of a term like &quot;capitalism&quot; is (a) the free market, or (b) government favoritism toward business, or (c) the separation between labor and ownership, an arrangement neutral between the other two; Austrians tend to use the term in the first sense; individualist anarchists in the Tuckerite tradition tend to use it in the second or third.[12] But in ordinary usage, I fear, it actually stands for an amalgamation of incompatible meanings.<p>&quot;Suppose I were to invent a new word, &quot;zaxlebax,&quot; and define it as &quot;a metallic sphere, like the Washington Monument.&quot; That&#x27;s the definition — &quot;a metallic sphere, like the Washington Monument.&quot; In short, I build my ill-chosen example into the definition. Now some linguistic subgroup might start using the term &quot;zaxlebax&quot; as though it just meant &quot;metallic sphere,&quot; or as though it just meant &quot;something of the same kind as the Washington Monument.&quot; And that&#x27;s fine. But my definition incorporates both, and thus conceals the false assumption that the Washington Monument is a metallic sphere; any attempt to use the term &quot;zaxlebax,&quot; meaning what I mean by it, involves the user in this false assumption. That&#x27;s what Rand means by a package-deal term.<p>&quot;Now I think the word &quot;capitalism,&quot; if used with the meaning most people give it, is a package-deal term. By &quot;capitalism&quot; most people mean neither the free market simpliciter nor the prevailing neomercantilist system simpliciter. Rather, what most people mean by &quot;capitalism&quot; is this free-market system that currently prevails in the western world. In short, the term &quot;capitalism&quot; as generally used conceals an assumption that the prevailing system is a free market.

Such confusion prevails because it works to the advantage of the statist establishment: those who want to defend the free market can more easily be seduced into defending neomercantilism, and those who want to combat neomercantilism can more easily be seduced into combating the free market.

I tip generously. Both of these statements are simultaneously true.<p>The vast majority of the countries in the world (that I&#x27;ve visited) do not believe in percentage based tipping as we do in North America [1]. A tip either involves rounding up to the nearest unit of currency, or takes the form of a small service fee added to the bill.<p>In North America, we&#x27;ve arrived at a situation where waitstaff actually prefer a tipped environment (due to high upside potential, especially where alcohol is served) and are also beholden to the tip (due to huge downside potential i.e. laws that mandate a lowered minimum wage for tipped workers).<p>Getting rid of tipping by instituting a living wage can sometimes result in lower upside, so many workers end up being against a fixed livable wage. The calculation is that stochastic&#x2F;high upsides (at bars, large groups) is preferable to stable but middling upside (i.e. living wage).<p>On the other hand, the laws of supply and demand still apply. Without high food prices and corresponding demand at those prices, a restaurant can&#x27;t sustain an untipped staff. So getting rid of tipping is a gamble and not many restaurants, especially low end ones, are able to swing it. Restaurants that are looking to get rid of tips are banking on the fact that the demand will remain the same at higher sticker prices (which in theory, should be true since the effective prices have not changed -- culturally a 15-20% tip is almost mandatory) but psychologically this often isn&#x27;t the case -- unless you have a sign at the door that says (no tips required).<p>It&#x27;s a little bit like Uber&#x2F;Lyft. The economics doesn&#x27;t actually work out, but there&#x27;s something propping it up. In the restaurant world, it&#x27;s tipping.

Palate Pal is a next-generation natural sweetener that not only sweetens foods, but also enhances flavor. It doesn&#x27;t have any bitter&#x2F;&quot;chemical&quot; aftertaste like all other alternative sweeteners and also a single serving will last you 30-60 minutes REGARDLESS of how much food you eat with it.<p>It is made from miracle fruit. This fruit has been used for centuries by tribes in Western Africa to make their food more delicious. It contains a protein that safely and temporarily binds to your tastebuds to make sour foods taste sweet as well as remove unpleasant bitter and tart flavors. For instance, bite into a lemon and it will taste like lemonade. It allows you to discover flavors previously masked by those unpleasant tastes. A strawberry tastes even more &quot;strawberry&quot; and a plain greek yogurt now tastes much more creamy.<p>It is the first miracle fruit product that is convenient for daily use. Whereas competing products take 5-10 minutes to dissolve, mine takes 10 seconds to dissolve and contains only NATURAL ingredients. I believe miracle fruit has the potential to take willpower out of the equation of a healthy diet by making nutritious foods taste as indulgent as the junk foods that are otherwise killing us. No one has the patience to wait 5 minutes in the morning while they are rushing to school or work, so I knew this is what needed to be changed in order for miracle berry to go mainstream.<p>Please check out my website for more information and demos.

It’s insanely expensive, quality of life has been on the decline for some time, and the types of companies that made real estate there so expensive in the first place are also likely to be the ones that adopt remote work quickly and wholeheartedly.<p>SF aside, my best guess at this point is that many American cities are and will continue to actually see some amount of people leaving for lower cost and more spacious markets, especially if remote work optionality sticks in the way it looks like it will. But cities have enduring appeal - proximity to people and culture and things to do is just as much a factor as proximity to work.

Went from California to Southern Texas, up to New Mexico, over to Arizona, Nevada, back to California, up to Oregon, Washington, hit the upper border, came back down to southern California.<p>What I saw astounded me. It was like the scene from Grapes of Wrath, crossed with the Beverley Hillbillies, crossed with Tokyo Drift.<p>I saw people leaving in droves but nowhere was it as bad as in California. There is a mass exodus of the state and no one seems to notice it.<p>People&#x2F;families are buying vans, even ford&#x2F;chevy service vans to live in due to them looking commercial(less hassle from people &#x2F;police), and having blacked out windows. They are also far cheaper than an rv.<p>Speaking of rvs some people are having to buy non running ones cheap and permapark somewhere. This includes families with pets, with no other recourse.<p>Every rest stop&#x2F;flying j was people leaving or homeless people permacamped. I spoke to them regularly and the stories were truly heart wrenching.<p>I also saw more paper plates (license plates) than regular ones (this is hyperbole but not far off the truth I&#x27;m sure even people not traveling have noticed this). Many of these people seemed to not know or care how to drive. I can&#x27;t begin to guess as to the reasons but people in cars with paper plates were 90 percent of the time a-holes on the road, and I saw many of them in accidents.<p>I&#x27;m sorry for the rant, I just am trying to say I&#x27;ve traveled the US extensively over my 40 years, but this one broke me. We have failed as a society, we do nothing for our most vulnerable, and its hurting us all.<p>I advise everyone to (when its safe) go to your local rest stops and flying j&#x2F;pilot&#x2F;whatever rest stop and talk to some of these people. Those homeless people I see so many complain about here (they&#x27;re crazy, druggies, they stink!) &lt;-all can be true, but they are still human deserving of your understanding and empathy, and I say this as someone who had a homeless guy threaten to eat my dogs. Obviously he had issues so I just left, but someone called the cops. Thankfully Santa Monica has mental health professionals the local police can rely on for such issues, so when I told them he did not threaten me or my life, he was left alone until mental health services could arrive. But I&#x27;ve seen far worse from the police in regards to homelessness in say, Bakersfield.<p>Also you will meet regular families, many now homeless, who have children with them or grandparents. Who worked their whole lives, some were even approved for unemployment months ago but never got a dime. Most families in the US can&#x27;t weather missing a single paycheck and these folks were asked to wait indefinitely, and its already been what, 6 months?<p>Or just talk to the ones who are moving, but don&#x27;t know where. Did you know that many property rental companies, at least in California, now demand 3 recent check stubs and proof of work, unemployment does not count. We literally have families who have money and still have to move out of state because by the time they got their money its been months since they last worked?<p>The moratorium on evictions was supposed to help people but guess what? Just like everything else it was perverted into something to hurt the people it was meant to help. Now no one wants a tenant that even may possibly be a risk in the future. We will see how long their properties are vacant before they begin begging for those families back.<p>Im sorry, I&#x27;m done, just all of this is so heartbreaking.<p><i><\/i>super late edit to add- the sheer volume of people I&#x27;ve met who were absolutely convinced coronavirus isnt real was mind blogging, especially since I lost several people close to me and know many others who were sick.

We never knew the real reason why, or if it was bigger than just a random app reviewer trying to apply Apple policy, until May 2019.<p>That&#x27;s when Bloomberg interviewed Phillip Shoemaker, who ran app reviews from 2009 to 2016 - regarding how Apple systemically removes whole categories of apps. I subsequently spoke to Phillip Shoemaker, who confirmed that Apple executives ordered the elimination of apps that drove downloads to the App Store. He said &quot;Your app drove download volume. Apple doesn’t want any outside sources to drive ratings. So yeah, we got rid of all app recommendation apps.&quot;  He said he thought it was unfair, but this was something Apple set out to do, and even as Senior Director of App Store (person directly in charge of App Review), he could not stop it.<p>The other thing that was hard to understand, is we used to have a great relationship with Apple. We were not flying under the radar. Since the App Store first launched in 2008, we used to be invited to all Apple events to see the new product launches, we met with the iTunes team to discuss upcoming initiates for the App Store, our apps were featured on the devices inside of many demo units into Apple Stores. It felt like a complete 180, and until this day I never got a formal conversation on what they actually objected to, beyond being pointed to a vague rule which was applied arbitrarily. They became a brick wall in terms of communication, and this is why I resorted to emailing Tim Cook. I assumed nothing would come of it, but it was the last thing I could think of.I never received a response, and never knew if he even got it, so I was shocked to see it again today from his inbox."],"time":["2020-08-17 21:11:58"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["headmelted"],"id":[24190396],"kids":[24191025,24191389,24190717,24191129,24190641,24190431,24192321,24191939,24191209,24190789,24191572,24191352,24190681,24190838,24191220,24208581,24206505,24192081,24203200,24227311,24195647],"parent":[24189341],"text":["I mean, there’s a point to be made about how much monopoly power Apple holds, and it’s now clear these questions weren’t asked until now because lawmakers were really sweet on the maker of their shiny iPhone - but this letter ain’t it.<p>The author is grovelling to the point of it being honestly pitiful.
