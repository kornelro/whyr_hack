We are angry because we want that to change. Lastly comes &#x27;emotional liberation&#x27;, where we are learning to better understand our feelings and unmet needs and where we can start asking for what we want.<p>I practiced NVC together with my ex-partner, and in my eyes we both grew our self-awareness enourmously."],"time":["2020-09-23 10:22:42"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["olivermarks"],"id":[24563338],"kids":{},"parent":[24562850],"text":["NPR seems to be veering off into a sort of Oprah self help area."],"time":["2020-09-23 07:35:34"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["semicolonandson"],"id":[24563230],"kids":{},"parent":[24553085],"text":["I&#x27;ve been lucky enough to be independent for 10 years thanks to a web-app (Oxbridge Notes)<p>Along the way, I learned a lot concerning both system design (e.g. dependencies, CI testing, monitoring) and also the marketing side required to channel enough customers into the business to generate revenue.<p>Lately I&#x27;ve recorded 25 or so videos about these topics — basically a day in the life in small tech.

Because it is plain JavaScript, your code changes the DOM directly. Svelte does not need a virtual DOM to simulate fast updates to the user.<p>Slow down. We all deploy plain JavaScript, no browser supports any other language.<p>Improving parsing and execution (at language level) bring very little improvement with Svelte over (for example) React. On the other hand, the absence of library functions to call may indeed flatten the call stack and give the perf boost promised by Svelte, but this requires Svelte to not being a library at all (more on that later).<p>This is also wording issue. It should have started with «the browser, mostly built around imperative structures, loves direct imperative changes to the DOM, and that’s how you MUST build the most efficient app interactions».<p>&gt; At deployment, you get vanilla JS, that running in your browser. Fast and plain JavaScript<p>Again, wording!<p>&gt; Apps developed are highly compatible. For example, if you develop a timer in Svelte, you can use the compiled version of your widget in any other framework. Why? Take a look at No. 1 it is VanillaJS.<p>(Point n. 1 being the previous quote)<p>This is not correct, or at least misleading. Every `.svelte` does indeed export an autonomous class that can be instantiated directly and mounted to a `target` DOM node, but that’s because Svelte is “embedded” inside the class.<p>In React you _can_ export a function which given a target DOM node mounts the app through `ReactDOM.render()` without the caller needing to have access to ReactDOM, it’s just not how you use components.<p>I have to admit that having that approach baked-in can be useful.<p>&gt; The maintainers are free in their choice of the features they want to include in the framework. As Svelte itself is not in the compiled JavaScript output […]<p>I don’t remeber who said that but I once found this gem: «The most fantastic trick C has ever done is making everyone believe that it has no runtime».<p>That’s the same topic here, that’s because Svelte has a non-zero amount of shared code. Yes mostly utilities, but yet… it is shipped with yout code!<p>Listen, we all agree that they smartly moved a considerable amount of logic from the run-time to the build-time and we all rejoyce at this awesome competition, but this article is overlooking at how much is still happening behind the scene and how much code is still placed in the compiled output.<p>- - -<p>One final note: I know that Suspense is now a running joke in the JS world and I’m just making fun of myself here, but I really want to see how Vue and Svelte will compare to the ergonomics the new concurrency features when they’ll land in React."],"time":["2020-09-23 12:31:25"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["stolenmerch"],"id":[24561915],"kids":[24562134],"parent":[24561534],"text":["I think Joe Rogan is so popular because he openly espouses ideas that MANY people feel and believe.

He doesn’t have any strong political agenda or affiliating with certain groups. He’s a regular dude just curious about other people’s life and views, and really gave his quests enough room to express themselves. This is important to many of us, that we want a platform where we can see the real, the human side of the guests, letting them explain themselves, rather than just snippets of soundbites clipped with different intentions by different groups, or 2-minute quick debates that’s often confusing than informative. That’s what makes the show more trustworthy to some people than some big networks.<p>There are warts that I frown upon as well. I disagree with some of this diets and views on intravenous supplements and stem cell treatment. And I never listen to his shows about aliens. But I have come to acceptance that aren’t and will not be a perfect show. The balance between informative and entertainment and eye-opening is quite a compromise. I think an educated person should treat the platform as a source of information, rather than THE source of information.<p>I guess what I really appreciate about the show is that people with vastly different views can still chat, drink and have a good time. For example, as someone outside US, I nevered had a good impression of Bernie Sanders until I watched the show seeing him talk and reason.  I never imagined Richard Dawkins’s response about consuming weed and mushroom. I have learned a lot from Joe about being an interviewer on how to get along with people you don’t fully agree with, especially on how to handles some of his consipiracy-loaded friend. Many of the TV interviews are too “heated” and “confrontational” for my liking. Sometimes I just enjoy listening to some silly and relaxing conversations. Bullshit from the guests can be distinguished without the interviewer actually calling them out on the show.<p>In the age of chaos and cancelling, I really appreciate such a platform.

However a lot of males need this sort of outlet for aggression, and by saying “males” need something specific it probably also triggers a lot of people who reject concepts of inherent male and female traits and major differences between the genders in preferences based on sex alone."],"time":["2020-09-23 03:34:27"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["jeff_jefferson"],"id":[24564213],"kids":[24564277,24564289,24564287],"parent":[24563647],"text":["The only reason that people are talking about explicit consent is that so many people (yes, mostly men) were either not noticing or not caring that there wasn&#x27;t even any implicit consent for their actions.<p>#MeToo was born out of people being abused and raped due to a culture that gave power to men who were beyond question.

Ctrl+a, ctrl+c:<p>---<p>America is now under siege by climate change in ways that scientists have warned about for years. But there is a second part to their admonition: Decades of growing crisis are already locked into the global ecosystem and cannot be reversed.<p>This means the kinds of cascading disasters occurring today — drought in the West fueling historic wildfires that send smoke all the way to the East Coast, or parades of tropical storms lining up across the Atlantic to march destructively toward North America — are no longer features of some dystopian future. They are the here and now, worsening for the next generation and perhaps longer, depending on humanity’s willingness to take action.<p>“I’ve been labeled an alarmist,” said Peter Kalmus, a climate scientist in Los Angeles, where he and millions of others have inhaled dangerously high levels of smoke for weeks. “And I think it’s a lot harder for people to say that I’m being alarmist now.”<p>Last month, before the skies over San Francisco turned a surreal orange, Death Valley reached 130 degrees Fahrenheit, the highest temperature ever measured on the planet. Dozens of people have perished from the heat in Phoenix, which in July suffered its hottest month on record, only to surpass that milestone in August.<p>Conversations about climate change have broken into everyday life, to the top of the headlines and to center stage in the presidential campaign. The questions are profound and urgent. Can this be reversed? What can be done to minimize the looming dangers for the decades ahead? Will the destruction of recent weeks become a moment of reckoning, or just a blip in the news cycle?<p>The Times spoke with two dozen climate experts, including scientists, economists, sociologists and policymakers, and their answers were by turns alarming, cynical and hopeful.<p>“It’s as if we’ve been smoking a pack of cigarettes a day for decades” and the world is now feeling the effects, said Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist at Texas Tech University. But, she said, “we’re not dead yet.”<p>Their most sobering message was that the world still hasn’t seen the worst of it. Gone is the climate of yesteryear, and there’s no going back.<p>The effects of climate change evident today are the results of choices that countries made decades ago to keep pumping heat-trapping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere at ever-increasing rates despite warnings from scientists about the price to be paid.<p>That price — more vicious heat waves, longer wildfire seasons, rising sea levels — is now irretrievably baked in. Nations, including the United States, have dithered so long in cutting emissions that progressively more global warming is assured for decades to come, even if efforts to shift away from fossil fuels were accelerated tomorrow.<p>‘Twice as Bad’\n“What we’re seeing today, this year, is just a small harbinger of what we are likely to get,” said Jonathan Overpeck, a climate scientist at the University of Michigan. Things are on track to get “twice as bad” as they are now, he said, “if not worse.”<p>Earth has already warmed roughly 1 degree Celsius, or 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit, since the 19th century. The most optimistic proposals made by world governments to zero out emissions envision holding warming to below 2 degrees Celsius. Nations remain far from achieving those goals.<p>Usually, each passing year’s records are framed by the past — the hottest temperatures ever observed, the biggest wildfires in decades. However, as Cristian Proistosescu, an assistant professor at the University of Illinois, noted on Twitter, it may be time to flip that chronological framing, and consider today the new starting point.<p>“Don’t think of it as the warmest month of August in California in the last century,” he wrote. “Think of it as one of the coolest months of August in California in the next century.”<p>Climate change is more a slope than a cliff, experts agreed. We’re still far from any sort of “game over” moment where it’s too late to act. There remains much that can be done to limit the damage to come, to brace against the coming megafires and superstorms and save lives and hold onto a thriving civilization.<p>“We can certainly move in a direction that serves us a lot better,” said Stephen Pyne, an environmental historian and professor emeritus at Arizona State University. “It’s not that it’s out of our control. The whole thing is in our control.”<p>It won’t be easy, particularly if past is prologue.<p>..."],"time":["2020-09-23 13:23:38"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["ilaksh"],"id":[24565697],"kids":[24565892],"parent":[24565271],"text":["I feel like they oversimplified a bit.<p>There is plenty of evidence of global warming without making it seem mainly about the wildfires.

This is what Australia has. The argument against this has always been about uninformed people voting and &quot;fraud&quot;. I used to be sympathetic to this argument until I saw the massive scale of voter suppression that occurs in the US.<p>Mandatory voting immediately changes the conversation from &quot;How do we get our side to vote and the other side note to?&quot; to the legal obligation officials have to ensuring everyone can vote.<p>Voting also happens on the weekend in Australia. This greatly simplifies finding polling places. Most of them are schools.<p>The other thing that Australia has that the US needs (which will never happen) is preferential voting.<p>A big mistake the US makes (IMHO) is how the election process itself is politicized. I mean who thought it was a good idea that election supervisors are an elected position?<p>In Australia, we have the Australian Electoral Commission, who is responsible for organizing elections, tallying and reporting the results and determining district boundaries. Somehow this manages to function without it being a partisan battleground.<p>The real problem here seems to be cultural. You have a conservative once-majority now-minority that seems to feel that the ends justify the means. I mean the level of hypocrisy here is truly jaw-dropping. Four years ago it was too contentious to hold hearings on a nominee 10 months before an election. Now? We may have a Supreme Court confirmation in a lame duck session.<p>Remember the outrage around Hilary&#x27;s emails? Yet on Russian interference in the election? Nothing. No, that&#x27;s &quot;fake news&quot;.<p>And by any objective measure, Trump himself is a reprehensible human being, whether you agree with his politics or not.<p>How self-described &quot;moral voters&quot; can turn a blind eye to all this, basically &quot;because abortion&quot;, is almost incomprehensible. I have to wonder if overturning Roe v. Wade might not be the best thing at this point. Two-thirds of the population live in states that will legalize it anyway and then this issue can stop being a rallying cry.<p>As for this effort, I don&#x27;t actually believe it was organized this way from the top (ie White House, RNC). It&#x27;s the sort of thing that really smells like some mid-level functionary and state politics wannabe acting on their own with something that ultimately probably won&#x27;t matter but is great virtue signaling (for someone who wants endorsements and support for some later election).<p>Or it could be some partisan mid-level manager who acted on their own.<p>To anyone saying &quot;no maintenance takes a day&quot;, I guarantee you it can.

I am going to be brave and not going to use a throwaway. I find it perplexing that HN crowd who is usually arguing for a balanced analysis and seeing both viewpoints is suddenly behaving as if this data proves some injustice is currently happening in India as well as US (in the context of Indian caste system). To be clear, India has&#x2F;had a caste system that was extremely oppressive. Currently though, the social aspects aside, economically and crucially educationally, the &quot;lower castes&quot;, have an advantage due to a system of reservations - affirmative action on steroids. I am not going to argue one way or the other as to whether the idea or the implementation of such an affirmative action policy is fair or net positive. It probably still is in principle, but in practice the people who seem to benefit from this, in my experience, are very rich &quot;lower caste&quot; families. More things to say here, but I don&#x27;t want to digress.\nThe law suit in the story has to do with IIT. So let&#x27;s take that specifically. IIT is extremely competitive to get into. It is even more competitive once you are in. It is common for affirmative action students to not do very well there. Call it a difference grit&#x2F;talent&#x2F;smartness whatever. This causes a some of them to disengage from studies altogether. Then it is not a stretch to imagine that some of them may not be very good at their job either.  The  lawsuit and the accusations of casteism has to be now taken with a huge pinch of salt. To be clear, I don&#x27;t know if any of the accusations in that lawsuit are true or not. But I do know that every middle class parent (including mine) drills into their kids the idea that you have to work freaking hard at studies to &quot;get some where&quot;. Everything about that 90 percent statistic can be explained through economics (already rich with all its advantages) or through desperation (high caste+ poor =&gt; no chance except if you work really hard). Of course I knew a few so called &quot;lower caste&quot; people in IIT who got in through the &quot;general category&quot; ie purely on merit.

It&#x27;s very difficult and time consuming to onboard yourself as an extension author with just the MS docs, since they don&#x27;t cover the entire API and the vast majority of data structures are undocumented entirely. This is really annoying when functions take structures as arguments and have optional fields. Descriptive naming isn&#x27;t descriptive if it describes how the argument is used by the callee, not what it means to the intent of the caller.<p>VSC also inherits the core weaknesses of Electron. Not overall performance&#x2F;memory so much as startup time (just a second ago I had to wait 3 minutes for VS Code to boot because I had too many workspaces open when my laptop&#x27;s battery died on me). It can&#x27;t open multiple windows in the same workspace (this is actually a fundamental flaw when debugging any kind of extension that needs to open its own workspace). It&#x27;s possible to build an extension that uses compiled node modules, which is great for performance and usability, but it&#x27;s officially unsupported because those modules are only compatible with the node version of a client&#x27;s VSCode.<p>But when all is said and done, VSC has shown that it&#x27;s a great platform and easy to target as an extension author (or easier than others), LSP and DAP are huge milestones, and the architecture itself is just so friendly to extension that it&#x27;s created a fantastic and lively ecosystem.<p>But petty gripe: please kill the git username&#x2F;password fields when I git clone a private repo over HTTPS in the console. I don&#x27;t like being aggro towards what other devs find cool, but I think hijacking a CLI with an extension incredibly annoying.

With languages like C, C++ or D, a lot of code isn&#x27;t known until compile time, so IDE cannot do any predictive magic. Same with refactoring, in C you can create new identifiers by preprocessor.

Which reflects the quality of the plugin ecosystem.<p>Can plugins really approach the productivity of a more specialized IDE like what JetBrains offers? I haven&#x27;t seen any evidence that they can, but I&#x27;m open minded. The most powerful language support I&#x27;ve seen in VSCode is absolutely TypeScript, and its very good... but is it a plugin? Its not listed in my plugins, it &quot;just works&quot; upon a clean install. Do the Go, Rust, etc plugins just need another four years of work, or will they never approach the quality of TS in VSCode because TS is &quot;built-in&quot;?<p>And, to be frank, TS is only &quot;very good&quot;. Its not &quot;great&quot; when compared to the support, for example, IntelliJ has for Java or VS has for C# when measuring things like the reliability and latency of intellisense and compiler feedback. Which, in my mind, represent the two most important things a code editor should do perfectly. When I have the question &quot;wait, what&#x27;s that io&#x2F;ioutil function for reading the content of a file&quot; in VSCode, I literally don&#x27;t even consider typing &quot;ioutil.&quot; and scrolling through the six functions in that package to get the answer, because I know before even trying that VSCode has a 20% chance of helping me.

But, it lacks in the other productivity features I listed above, and I do think those are more important to get right, for the sole sake of productivity.<p>I mean, in short, if the next decade is VS Code As King, then it will be a sad decade. I don&#x27;t trust that VS Code can solve these major issues it has had for four years.

It&#x27;s a very opinionated piece of software that serves lots of popular niches well right now, but I haven&#x27;t yet been able to find a mix of extensions that makes it a viable replacement for IntelliJ for Scala, to name one example.<p>I&#x27;d expect the next uber popular editor to be optimized towards completely different things, though. VS Code is a great all-purpose IDE for enthusiasts and professionals, who are willing and able to dig into pretty complex UIs and complicated concepts. Take the git integration – it frequently breaks (for me), and when it works, it&#x27;s really very superficial and requires me to really understand what git is doing in the background.<p>Last year I&#x27;ve tried to teach my dad how to use git, so he can put his python robotics projects in GitHub. It&#x27;s been eye-opening: All the idiosyncracies and complex ideas that I&#x27;ve grown accustomed to over the years, that&#x27;s one Eiger North Face of a learning curve if all you want to do is get those Python files on GitHub and have some people collaborate with you there.<p>It&#x27;s also pretty hard to discover functionality in VS Code. It wants to be everything to everyone, so it can&#x27;t expose functionality in a way that specialized IDEs can – and even those tend to be either messy or sort of cryptic. It&#x27;s really hard to be effective in any IDE without memorizing dozens of keyboard shortcuts, which isn&#x27;t a problem for software people, because we either like this, or have grown accustomed to it. I guess that&#x27;s why the Touchbar is wildly popular outside of software engineering and related disciplines – for apps that support it, it exposes functionality directly and in a context-sensitive manner.<p>Hundreds of millions of people around the world will start programming in this decade as the world is rushing into a future where code is the stuff that most of anything outside pristine wilderness that we ever experience, is at least partially made of or faciliated by, that all social, economic, political activity rests upon.<p>There is no tooling that would be appropriate for this kind of use case – whatever will end up filling that niche, the casual programmer who doesn&#x27;t want to get deeply involved with software engineering, but get their semi-complex problems solved without tasking a team of SWEs, whatever will do this will have to be a lot cleverer, easier to use, more discoverable, more intuitive – make collaboration feel much more seamless – and still be very powerful.
