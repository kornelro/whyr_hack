Likewise, a strong, high-entropy password is impractical to guess.<p>Running on nonstandard ports, however?  It doesn&#x27;t add practical security because guessing is so trivial.  The author&#x27;s twitter reach had a 50&#x2F;50 split on whether they scanned all ports for pen-testing, so that implies that using a nonstandard port increases the time-to-compromise from either (lifetime of the universe) or (about an hour) to twice that, depending on whether the second (real) layer of security is vulnerable.  In neither case does the obscure port provide meaningful protection.<p>Some activities like port-knocking <i>can<\/i> add security, but only if the practitioner thinks of the knocking as a secret from the start.  That requires:<p>* Limiting who has knowledge of the secret (i.e.: a port knocking routine known only to you is secret; one distributed in a public client for access to a production service is not),\n* Having plans in place to change the secret if it is ever compromised (DeCSS) or found to be flawed, and\n* Ideally ensuring that the secret cannot be guessed &#x2F; confirmed independently of other secrets.<p>Other suggestions in the article ignore this difference:<p>* Database encryption requires an attacker to possess two secrets for extraction (internal access to the database plus the key) rather than just one.  It&#x27;s not obscurity.\n* Randomizing variable names or obfuscating code is <i>not<\/i> a secret because an interested attacker can reverse the obfuscation with ordinary human levels of effort.  The confidence here is strictly false, since it &quot;secures&quot; against low-effort attackers and not high-effort ones.  The &quot;secret&quot; is distributed publicly, so it is no secret at all.\n* The convoy example is again a secret; the point is that a would-be attacker does not know which car contains the target <i>and has no reasonable ability to guess<\/i> with better-than-chance success.<p>Obscurity goes from marginally effective (or outright ineffective) to counterproductive when its implementation makes it harder for the designer to reason about their own system.  Someone who rolls their totally unique cryptosystem is relying in part on algorithmic obscurity for their security, but in doing so they give up on established (and battle-tested) best practices in favour of their own limited analysis.<p>Ultimately, the &quot;Swiss cheese&quot; model of security is a poor analogy because a big number for a human is a small number for a computer.  To take the convoy analogy again, a would-be attacker is only going to get one shot, but a computer can try billions."],"time":["2020-09-11 20:00:54"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["jkire"],"id":[24445206],"kids":{},"parent":[24444497],"text":["To me all these slogans around security is to ensure people really, truly, actually think about things before they go against the grain. Is using obscurity as part of your defence always wrong? No, but equally it often adds a false sense of security. Popularising these easy to remember slogans helps change peoples defaults. Nowadays, if someone sees an attempt at security by obscurity it (hopefully) rings alarm bells and causes them to interrogate it to ensure that there is also other security measures in place, or that it is otherwise OK. It&#x27;s the same with &quot;never roll your own crypto&quot;<p>I find it somewhat interesting that the article uses an example which falls right into another pitfall that &quot;security vs obscurity&quot; is trying to prevent.<p>&gt; SSH runs in port 64323 and my credentials are utku:123456. What is the likelihood of being compromised?\n&gt;\n&gt; Now we changed the default port number. Does it help? Firstly, we’ve eliminated the global brute forcers again since they scan only the common ports. ... So, if you switch your port from 22 to 64323, you will eliminate some of them. You will reduce the likelihood and risk.<p>This is technically correct. However, the author has identified a security concern that he wants to mitigate: brute force attacks. Now, you could try and reduce that risk by using a different port which might reduce it by 50%<i>, <\/i>or* you could fix this issue by deploying fail2ban (or using ssh keys, or VPNs and bastion boxes, etc), and thus negating that attack vector entirely. There isn&#x27;t even a usability argument here: making people remember the right port for ssh is <i>less<\/i> usable than setting up fail2ban. Of course there are tonnes of other attack vectors to consider, but in general where possible its better to &quot;properly&quot; (fsvo.) mitigate those concerns and only rely on obscurity where that isn&#x27;t possible. If a concern is mitigated than adding obscurity does almost nothing, while likely proving to be more annoying to the end user (like in the case of specifying a port in the above example).<p>Now of course that&#x27;s not to say that you should never use obscurity, but if you do then I think its entirely reasonable that you are prepared to give a good justification why its appropriate. For example, sharing via secret URLs is a good example where it can be easy to justify in some settings, but it equally may not be OK for documents that are really really sensitive as its relatively easy for links to be shared in error with the wrong people.<p>RE some comments about using obscurity to signal that your deployments would be harder to get into and thus for attackers to not bother: I&#x27;d genuinely love to know if that is true or not, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if attackers assumed obfuscation mean that the more advance security measures hadn&#x27;t been deployed (otherwise why bother with obfuscation?).<p>* Based on the twitter poll in TFA, though if you have a targeted attack it seems sensible to assume that if port 22 doesn&#x27;t work they&#x27;d try again with other methods"],"time":["2020-09-11 19:35:35"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":{},"id":[24452395],"kids":{},"parent":[24444497],"text":{},"time":["2020-09-12 15:49:35"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["valgeirg"],"id":[24448206],"kids":{},"parent":[24444497],"text":["I am not going to read the article because i am to lazy, but I agree."],"time":["2020-09-12 00:58:23"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["kseifried"],"id":[24446640],"kids":{},"parent":[24444497],"text":["Making security by obscurity actually work<p>The reality is security by obscurity CAN work, but only if three critical elements are met:<p>The first is to know when the obscurity has failed<p>The second is to be able to quickly change the obscured component (e.g. a password)<p>The third element is the hardest, security by obscurity only really works if you can survive exposure of the obscured data&#x2F;system<p>Which leads to the fourth element: security through obscurity IS NOT security through secrecy (so either I&#x27;m a liar or bad at counting, leave your vote in the comments below)<p>Let&#x27;s start with the 4th element, obscurity vs secrecy. Passwords. Passwords generally only work if they are secret. Some password systems like Kerberos take great pains to ensure passwords remain secret, for example by NOT sending the password itself to a remote system, but by sending proof that the user has the password (grossly simplified, but generally correct, now you understand Kerberos!). Secrecy involves hiding things that if exposed will be a problem that can&#x27;t be solved, like your password, the formula to Coca-Cola and so on.<p>Obscurity won&#x27;t work for things that need to be secret. Obscurity won&#x27;t work for things that once exposed result in the game ending.<p>Even when an item can be obscured, it is still important to know when it is no longer obscured, otherwise you now have an element of your security system that has effectively been breached. For example if you are using randomized port numbers to prevent SSH scanners from constantly trying default username&#x2F;password combinations and someone (like shodan.io) port scans you and publishes your SSH server ports you either need to change that, or not be relying on that obscurity for your security (e.g. I used to change my SSH port #&#x27;s just to reduce logging activity and make it easier to filter&#x2F;read logs for actually malicious activity).<p>The second element is that once your obscurity becomes known you need to be able to change it, if you can&#x27;t change your SSH port # (because you don&#x27;t have a way to tell clients where it is) then you have a security control that cannot be recovered and you lose it. Security elements should always strive for long term survivability because the simple fact is attackers get to try more than once.<p>The third and final element (because we started counting at 4!) is your system cannot simply fail because the obscure element was discovered. Using a no standard port for SSH works if you also use strong passwords or (ideally) key based login. Obscuring SSH ports and leaving a default admin:1234 login is brittle, and as evidenced by scanners like shodan.io easily exploited.<p>I think, honestly, the best use case for &quot;security by obscurity&quot; is to cut down on the noise of logs and casual scanning&#x2F;scripted hacking, which can be valuable, having less chaff to sort through for actual attacks can both save time and money, but also give you a better chance of finding the real attacks.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.voice.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;@kurtseifried&#x2F;making-security-by-obscurity-actually-work-1599853811-1\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.voice.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;@kurtseifried&#x2F;making-security-by-...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-09-11 21:52:06"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["cthalupa"],"id":[24445564],"kids":{},"parent":[24444497],"text":["This article misses the point and makes a bunch of arguments that fall apart on anything more than the surface level... much like security through obscurity.<p>We&#x27;ll look at the SSH port example.<p>What does changing the port get you? You no longer get hit by the automated sweeping that hits basically all internet accessible IPs. Cool! So you had root&#x2F;password or root&#x2F;apple or whatever, you were going to get owned by the automated scans, good, you&#x27;re now more secure. But you shouldn&#x27;t have been using a weak password to begin with, and now there is a very real risk that you think you are more secure than you were previously.<p>He compares this to animals that have natural camouflage, or the President switching cars in his convoy. But there&#x27;s no guarantee that you will see an owl in a tree, or be able to determine which car the President is in. But you can scan every port on an IP and find sshd listening with fingerprinting. The cost there is basically zero for someone that wants to attack you. If all I had to do was wait a few seconds longer to make sure I saw an owl or know what car the President is in, then they would not be effective either. You cannot compare situations where there are specific limitations and use them as proof positive for a situation where those limitations don&#x27;t exist.<p>And this is important: His recommendation to run sshd on 64323 is also just actively making you <i><\/i>LESS<i><\/i> secure. Ports under 1024 are privileged on Linux - you must have superuser privileges or otherwise be granted access to bind to these ports. No such protections exist for 64323. Now, let&#x27;s say you have a user level compromise on that server - they start a process monitoring to see if sshd ever restarts&#x2F;crashes&#x2F;otherwise stops listening on the port it was listening on, and as soon as it does, they start their own malicious sshd replacement. Now all it takes is someone ignoring the host key mismatch to give away their credentials, which the attack can then likely use to penetrate further into your environment.<p>The author doesn&#x27;t fully understand the add on effects of his suggestion here, and as a result one of his security by obscurity tips makes you less secure to a focused attacker. Meanwhile, if you REALLY wanted to secure SSH you do not make it listen on internet accessible IPs, and only have it available when you VPN in and access it via a jumphost while using key based auth with 2FA on top of it.<p>When you start obfuscating your code, using random variable names, and generally making it harder to read, how much more likely are you to introduce bugs than you would with a clean code base? Are human introduced bugs more likely to be a security risk than variable names being random? Than code being obfuscated?<p>I don&#x27;t disagree with encrypting the database, but I also don&#x27;t consider encryption or password&#x2F;key protecting something security by obscurity.<p>Basically: Obscuring things helps prevent you from low effort attackers that should not be scary to you to begin with. They do nothing to minimal amounts to protect you from dedicated attackers, and potentially introduce new risks that allow easier access from dedicated attackers. The sort of security measures you should be implementing to stop dedicated attackers will already eliminate the risk from the low effort attackers.<p>NONE of the arguments in this article are new, and they have all been argued against quite extensively in the past."],"time":["2020-09-11 20:07:50"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["maitredusoi"],"id":[24448050],"kids":{},"parent":[24444497],"text":["My 2 cents : use port 26, it is below 1024 and assigned to various other things... so you are hidding better !"],"time":["2020-09-12 00:36:36"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["dr-detroit"],"id":[24444593],"kids":{},"parent":[24444497],"text":["Where I work I am not allowed to make risk decisions for the organization."],"time":["2020-09-11 18:45:23"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["throwaway45829"],"id":[24449373],"kids":{},"parent":[24444497],"text":["Utku, try to enroll in a PhD program.

When it inevitably fails (either because of the aforementioned reason or because a global scanner has the clever idea of trying some more obscure usernames) everyone looking back on it will wonder why you built this Rube Goldberg machine instead of just using SSH keys.<p>Changing the RDP port is a slightly better example of actually using security through obscurity as a defensive layer because Microsoft doesn’t give you any good ways to lock down RDP (best practice is of course keeping it behind a VPN or using a Remote Desktop solution with a more modern authentication system), but from a practical point of view I know several companies that were hit with ransomware this year via RDP on a non-standard port.

I would love to hear other people&#x27;s suggestions, because while I have found that the below algorithm works, any improvement would be greatly helpful.<p>1 - Is the Ugh work so small, that if I just power through it, it can be done in ~15 minutes?  If so, give yourself an hour break or so, then just slam your head into that wall.  15 minutes is hardly any time at all.<p>Otherwise, follow the general below pattern:<p>2 - Document out the task.  Figure out exactly that needs to be done.  Most procrastination research I&#x27;ve seen, and personal experience validates, that just documenting out the task moves it from the theoretical (and easier to procrastinate) to something more tangible (and therefore less likely to be avoided &#x2F; less scary).<p>3 - Break the task out into small, concrete components.  The smaller the components, the better.  (procrastination research also strongly suggests this, as small concrete tasks are easier to visualize just doing and getting done, and feel less scary than big unknown problems).<p>4 - Out of all of those tasks you just broke out, can we throw any in the trash and ignore them?  Once this became an &quot;ugh&quot; task, we stopped trying to solve this task perfectly.  At this point, we just want completion, because this is holding up something more important (otherwise, why are we doing it at all?).<p>5 - Out of all those tasks you just broke out, are all of them ugh tasks?  Or are some of them neutral &#x2F; easy?  Often, just breaking things out into small tasks gets rid of the ugh factor, because now you can handle it in pieces.  Its the combination of trying to do all the pieces at once that gives it an &quot;ugh&quot; factor (for example, doing all of the chores on a Sunday can be an Ugh.  But having a list of chores I need to do in the next few days, and just do one or two now?  Not bad at all, provided I never have to look at the entire list and get overwhelmed again, and can just pluck one from the top and feel good about my progress).  Either way, do the easy &#x2F; neutral ones left.<p>6 - At this point, hopefully, the Ugh task is now just a fraction of the size it once was.  If we&#x27;re under 15 minutes, just brute force it, and have some ice cream &#x2F; whiskey &#x2F; outdoor time as a reward.<p>7 - If the remaining ugh task still exists, or is atomic, estimate the amount of time it is going to take you.  10X that estimate.  That is now the amount of time you must dedicate to that task, in order to get through it sanely and happily.<p>It was going to take you ~1-2 hours to look up that financial data that you really hate standardizing in excel?  Great, that&#x27;s what YOUR ENTIRE SATURDAY is now dedicated to.  Take breaks, play video games, do other things.  Because in reality, you&#x27;re going to work for 15 minutes, then take a break for an hour, then work for 30 minutes, then go to the store for 2 hours, then work for 20 minutes, then cook dinner, etc, etc, etc.<p>An Ugh task with an estimate of 1 hour is usually an annoying task with an estimate of 10 hours (9 of which are positive, happy activities)."],"time":["2020-09-11 21:09:07"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["ralphstodomingo"],"id":[24451600],"kids":{},"parent":[24445603],"text":["I&#x27;ve had some recent success at confronting these incidents by finding some secondary purpose or source of fun in the activity.<p>For example, there&#x27;s a company-wide report I&#x27;m in charge of curating every week.

It has almost all of the lexical functions and operators featured in Dyalog APL, the leading commercial APL interpreter and the most featureful APL implementation. It has many more features than the FOSS GNU APL, which is based on the old IBM APL2.<p>Dyalog APL&#x27;s source code is about 500KLOC according to Dyalog&#x27;s staff. GNU APL is over 100KLOC per its homepage. April&#x27;s .lisp files currently stand at 6350LOC.<p>APL interpreters have traditionally been hard to connect to external data sources. Because APL is typically implemented as an interpreter, any connection to a database or other external system needs to be built into that interpreter as a plugin. April is called from within a Lisp program and you can pass it any array-formatted data. You can use CL libraries to read from any database or other source, format the data as an array and pass it to April for processing.<p>April takes some features from the k language, including ($[oneorzero;1;0]) if-statements and (g<U+2190>{[a;b;c]a+b×c} <U+22C4> g[1;2;3]) n-argument functions.<p>April is extensible - you can easily create an extension to the language with more functions and operators, and you can also re-implement the utility functions that are used to parse and compile the language. The language is designed from the ground up to support extension. There is also a framework to extend the compiler to optimize common idioms, for instance <U+2283><U+233D>,200 200 200<U+2374><U+2373>9 is optimized to just fetch the last row-major-ordered element of the big array instead of actually taking the time and memory to ravel and reverse it.<p>The second half of the video features a preview of a hardware startup called Bloxl that&#x27;s powered by Common Lisp and April. Bloxl is a big transparent block wall with LEDs inside the light up to create pixel graphics. April was used to build the animations that run on Bloxl."],"time":["2020-09-11 19:40:38"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["phantomics"],"id":[24435114],"kids":{},"parent":[24434717],"text":["Thanks for posting my presentation, April&#x27;s been great fun to write."],"time":["2020-09-10 20:24:51"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["bitwize"],"id":[24451092],"kids":[24455788],"parent":[24434717],"text":["Any sufficiently complicated Lisp program contains an ad-hoc, informally-specified, bug-ridden, slow implementation of half of APL.<p>Arrays &gt; lists, just ask your CPU&#x27;s D$."],"time":["2020-09-12 11:18:29"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["lalalandland"],"id":[24453598],"kids":{},"parent":[24434717],"text":["Misses speech impediment yoke by not calling it Aplil"],"time":["2020-09-12 18:31:09"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["ncmncm"],"id":[24439838],"kids":[24445350],"parent":[24434717],"text":["Without watching the video, can we guess correctly that &quot;for Common Lisp&quot; means &quot;in Common Lisp&quot;?

During those valuations, most startups strive to paint their value as being very low: “Seriously, folks, the market could dry up and leave common shareholders with nothing.” The resulting common share value is often pegged at 1&#x2F;10 to 1&#x2F;3 of the preferred share value implied by the most frequent fundraising round. Lower strike prices make it easier for employees to exercise their options and provide more upside.<p>My understanding is that a sufficient volume of equity sales can force new 409(a) valuations. These would require more payments to an external accounting firm, and 4x the work to do it quarterly, work that often consumes leadership cycles. Moreover, these valuations would likely have the effect of narrowing the gap between common and preferred share values, elevating the strike price and squeezing potential profits out of employee equity.<p>It’s probably different once a company is large enough that it’s granting RSUs.

For both my current job and the new offer, I&#x27;ll calculate total expected compensation after 3 years from now assuming bad performance, realistic performance and best performance. Those numbers alone can be very enlightening. If the offer&#x27;s realistic projection is less than the current realistic projection, I politely let the negotiator know that their offer will need tweaking to have parity with my current situation. Either way, I&#x27;ll suggest a counter offer that puts the realistic compensation at least 1.2x current if it isn&#x27;t already, then play it by ear from there.

Deleting code is actually one of the most difficult things to do in a project.  To do it properly and without risking breaking things, requires not only vast and detailed knowledge of the system, but also knowing the context and decision around when the feature was added.<p>A long tenure engineer is the perfect fit for this.  They know how to surgically remove the useless code.  They remember all the hopes they had for the feature and when it failed to produce those results.  They know well that code is not free, it&#x27;s an ongoing cost to maintenance and complexity.  This is not easy work to give to a junior.  It&#x27;s not even for senior engineers because they often lack the context and broad system knowledge.  Only the long tenure staff engineer can confidently say, that feature failed, and I can remove it without breaking anything.  If someone brings up sunken cost fallacy and how some users use the feature, only the long tenure staff has the background, respect, and authority to say, no this feature failed, it has 1% of the results we wanted, it&#x27;s not worth the ongoing maintenance burden.<p>A staff engineer is supposed to a team multiplier through code.  People often think of designs, refactoring, helpful tools, architecture discussions and documents.  And it&#x27;s true, these are all code related things that can multiply a team&#x27;s efforts when done well.<p>But what better way to multiply a team&#x27;s productivity than to reduce the size of the system?  Think of how green field projects start.  They feel so fast and progress is so quick.  Then the features come, more and more, slowing down development with expanding system complexity and maintenance of code.  How much faster and quicker can the team move after the staff engineer has reduced the system by 50%?  It&#x27;s like turning back the clock on an aging system.  Suddenly it feels years younger, able to move quickly again, but this time with the right features in place from the experience of past years.

Far from being repelled (or amused at his standing alone) as I was years ago by his coming down on the opposite side of judgements I thought were socially just and good, I now come to understand better what he was doing. At least if you believe his talks.<p>After listening to his talks (and then thinking back to his opinions), I understand he was trying to make sure that the Constitution was followed to the letter of the law, and that if the people were unhappy with it, let them change it so that it reflected the popular desires.  But let it follow that process.  Not have social or political will creep its way in via individual judges&#x27; or courts&#x27; determination something was now &quot;acceptable enough&quot; that it could be ruled to have evolved and be constitutional at the present time.<p>And that the writers of the Constitution were trying to prevent disaster as much as trying to enable progress -- and that we should be careful when we stray from the words encoding that goal, because when you do that it opens up all sorts of unintended consequences.<p>(Hence the connection to this OP&#x27;s story + comments about law as source code.)<p>This really opened my eyes about what that aspect of judicial conservatism is about.  Not that I agree with all of its philosophy or tendency (in politics) to court a certain sector of the vote, for example.  But it did arouse in me a respect for the guy, to know that for example:<p>If you start relying or putting upon certain institutions (the courts) in society responsibilities or goals to effect the change you want, that may not always be the right thing to do, although it may be the easy &#x2F; politically expedient thing to do at the present time.   Because there may come a day when that power might go opposite to what you wanted (or more importantly, what is right).  And maybe what this country&#x27;s founders set up was consciously a decision to keep things from going off the tracks when too many people thought some rules should simply be imposed by judges because it was the popular thing to do.<p>Other unintended side effects may include: politicization of the judiciary, which we know all too well today.<p>I would encourage anyone curious to listen to some of his talks (especially the Q&amp;A).  Honestly, it really did open my eyes to hear about it.   Maybe I&#x27;m getting more conservative in my old age, but when you&#x27;re a person responsible for others and some process, you start to appreciate this kind of thinking.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Ggz_gd--UO0\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Ggz_gd--UO0<\/a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=TRS-jdgHok4\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=TRS-jdgHok4<\/a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=fkChru9L3xA&amp;t=4s\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=fkChru9L3xA&amp;t=4s<\/a>\n(skip all the preface, to his speech at 4min, or skip to the Q&amp;A as the talk is mainly about what the role of morals is in the judiciary&#x2F;government)<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=aXSGDXbc9ZA\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=aXSGDXbc9ZA<\/a> (very entertaining)<p>And besides all that, what a personality and entertaining figure, and powerhouse of knowledge.

I&#x27;ve spent a half hour using your app and it&#x27;s great! I was feeling a bit tense, confused and unmotivated this morning and going through the technique with your app really made a difference. Thanks!<p>For those not in the know, this is based on what&#x27;s sometimes called the Sedona Method. There&#x27;s a popular book about it by Hale Dwoskin [0] and the questions (and phrasing) in this app are almost exactly the same (the self-questions are an important part of the technique).<p>I&#x27;ve been geeking out about psychological self-help for a long time and this is by far the simplest and most effective (especially in terms of the ratio between accessibility and effectiveness) method I&#x27;ve come around. The idea, to summarize it crudely, is that you can just let go of feelings. You&#x27;re a layer cake of stuff and the more you take off the better things get. At first it sometimes feels like &quot;ok, I&#x27;ve let go of this basic thing, but I&#x27;m no better off&quot; (it&#x27;s a bit like the situation you&#x27;d find yourself in if you started shoveling a landfill). The technique, apart from the basic insight that you can let go, provides troubleshooting and guidance that let&#x27;s you get a lot of results from something that is so simple. One of the things that originally attracted me to it was the feeling I had that, whatever the mechanism behind my hangups is, it&#x27;s simple, but with emergent behaviour, and this really satisfied that part of me, and has been otherwise very rewarding as well.<p>My favorite book on the topic is Letting Go by David R. Hawkins [1], which is also one of my favorite books of all time. I could sing praises for it for a long time; it&#x27;s been a big deal for me. If I need a spiritual pick-me-up, that&#x27;s the book. It&#x27;s a really good instruction manual for your mind, feelings, emotions. If you think you might lack emotional intelligence, this book is a good place to start too.<p>If you feel like this method is working for you and you want to learn more, I recommend going back and forth between the two books. They have very different approaches on the same thing. I found that at different times I needed more of the one or the other.<p>In the app, I noticed that the voice-over &quot;letting go might be new for you&quot; kicks in every time you&#x27;re going through a new emotion. Might be better if it was there only for the first time.<p>I think I&#x27;ll be coming back to this app a lot. Thanks again!

There are plenty of reasons why records are great that don&#x27;t usually get mentioned here.<p>* The big one: There is tons of music out there that isn&#x27;t on streaming services. If you like punk, breakcore, UK dubstep, noise, really anything even a little bit out of the mainstream, or from the past - you can&#x27;t find the best stuff on any streaming services.

If you keep good care of your records - and you have good taste - you&#x27;ll find that your collection _appreciates_ in value over time, unlike other forms which _depreciate_. Some of the records I picked up in high school are worth over a hundred bucks now! Not that I plan on ever selling them, but it&#x27;s nice to know I could.<p>* Vinyl is something to do while traveling! It&#x27;s great going to another country or city and browsing the record shops and finding something you&#x27;re after, or something funky  looking in the $2 bin. Random finds in dollar bins are a bit like Magic: The Gathering cards - usually crap, but occasionally brilliant.

Some notable games that were deemed &quot;beautiful&quot; in the past are now seen as less-beautiful as it became apparent that play was suboptimal. Chess beauty now is less about flashy combinations and more about qualities of a position and reverse engineering the &quot;logic&quot; behind certain AI moves, which is still great but admittedly requires more of an investment on learning the game than a spectator might care about.<p>That framing, though, leaves out the massive benefit that AI has had in training and improving new players.

I put up a $10k challenge to develop an AI that could defeat the top human players. A challenge match was run every year from 2004 to 2015 when it was finally claimed (one year before AI took over Go). There was a variant of Arimaa that I didn&#x27;t go with since the games did not seem that interesting. It was the same as current Arimaa, but without any trap squares. So no pieces were captured and the game seem to take longer to finish, but I think it may have been a more strategic version (less tactics). I still wonder sometimes if that would have been helped the humans stay ahead a bit longer. I avoided that version since I was not sure if it could lead to deadlock positions. Play testing to check for flaws especially at high level play would be way to much effort for humans. It would be less effort to have an AI check the game rules. Although there is still a big cost to doing that. The AI researchers in the Arimaa community have recently developed an AI that has learned to play Arimaa through self play.

I work primarily with early stage startups, often pre-product, building prototypes and V1s. The primary objective of the teams I work on is to validate product strategy, which requires moving quickly to de-risk initial development and iterate.<p>The past few years has completely changed the way I execute this strategy. Leaning heavily on products like these that allow us to develop software with very little or sometimes no code at all. It&#x27;s nuts what you can build in a few days.<p>Discovering Rails in 2009 was the last big shift for me in this way, with tools like scaffolding to build out the skeleton of any dynamic CRUD section in a few seconds. Still, it wasn&#x27;t uncommon to subsequently spend days or weeks getting specific sections of the site to reach parity with designs.<p>Some people talk about how this trend is a threat to web developers like me. While it&#x27;s true that it&#x27;s never been easier for anyone to build high-quality dynamic websites, that position completely overlooks the benefits for traditional web developers. This new toolchain is like having superpowers for a very specific type of development. Pairing that with solid knowledge of web fundamentals and the ability to &quot;grow up&quot; beyond the limitations of the system is a recipe for delivering work faster than ever before.

Inside &quot;foo&quot; you have a few subcrates (named &quot;foo_bar&quot;, &quot;foo_baz&quot;, &quot;foo_qux&quot;). There are a number of situations where a crate will have subcrates. Sometimes these subcrates are intended to be used publicly (e.g., you want people to be able to use just the &quot;foo_bar&quot; subcrate if they don&#x27;t need the whole &quot;foo&quot; crate) Sometimes these subcrates aren&#x27;t intended to be used publicly (e.g., Cargo forces you to put your proc macro in a separate crate, but that&#x27;s an implementation detail of &quot;foo&quot; and isn&#x27;t something other people should use directly).<p>So now you have &quot;foo&quot; on crates.io, as well as a bunch of &quot;foo_*&quot; subcrates on crates.io. Currently there is nothing stopping some random developer from publishing their own &quot;foo_haha&quot; crate. This new crate isn&#x27;t related to your &quot;foo&quot; crates and might even be squatting on a name you would have liked to use for a subcrate.<p>Or multiple people might want to create different crates for similar things. e.g., there are multiple regular expression crates. But only one of these crates got the &quot;regex&quot; name. Everyone else has to use a different name, and sometimes people use creative (unintuitive) crate names.<p>So for various reasons, some people want namespacing on crates.io that would allow someone to reserve an entire namespace. This would allow you to prevent others from  using a name that might be confusingly similar to yours. It also allows you to use conflicting crate names if multiple people want to publish different crates with the same name.<p>TL;DR some people want something like npm&#x27;s scopes for crates.io. And other people don&#x27;t want it. This has led to much debate and arguing and whatnot.<p>It&#x27;s funny, though, because the team that owns crates.io almost never weighs in on the discussion, and on the rare occasion that one of the team members does say something they always do it in a personal capacity and not in a way that represents the team.

This means the default registry, if nothing is added is &#x27;crates.io&#x2F;&#x27; but you can specify any other registry, eg &#x27;gitlab.local&#x2F;looks&#x2F;like&#x2F;namespace&#x27; for personal CI, or even &#x27;crates.io&#x2F;{username}&#x27;<p>Let&#x27;s give each user their own registry at &#x27;crates.io&#x2F;{username}&#x27;.

Honestly, I&#x27;ve never really understood the security argument here cause there&#x27;s no reason an owner can&#x27;t hand over a single package. As well, there&#x27;s no reason a currently trusted owner can&#x27;t patch update a package with bad code. This is a social problem that has no solution and is the same for both naming systems, so we need to come up with another way of handling things. Personally I think all published crates should be immutable and all deps should be pegged, not even allowing patches. But this leads to the argument that sometimes publishers really do want to take down a crate. I&#x27;m on the fence with this one, so let&#x27;s try to solve it in another way.<p>So the problem is we need to potentially remap any (transitive) dependency to something else, and since we still have a flat hierarchy we really just need to remap the registry for that dependency. So let&#x27;s add a registry remapping section for the cargo deps ... wait cargo already has something for that (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doc.rust-lang.org&#x2F;cargo&#x2F;reference&#x2F;source-replacement.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doc.rust-lang.org&#x2F;cargo&#x2F;reference&#x2F;source-replacement...<\/a>). (Reading through the docs here, it does seems like it might be a little strict on whether we can use it for this case, but it&#x27;s pretty close.)<p>OK wrapping up, it looks like we could have backwards compatible namespaces right now if crates.io would just implement user specific registries, ie it&#x27;s an implementation detail. And the security issues are really no different than before.

I&#x27;ve looked at binary decision diagrams (or their relational multi-valued counterparts: Multi-Valued Decision Diagrams). Etc. etc.<p>It is &quot;obvious&quot; that minimizing columns and removing unnecessary columns can grossly improve performance. But I can&#x27;t find any efficient algorithm that detects this case.<p>Lets say we have Table ABCD (with 4 columns: ABCD).

AVX2 supports AND, OR, NOT, XOR in a single clocktick (heck: Skylake supports 3 256-bit boolean instructions per clocktick. Zen2 supports 4 per clocktick)<p>---------------<p>While 2048-bit (11 variable) tables maximize memory bandwidth through SIMD instructions, the real &quot;rich&quot; instructions exist in the 64-bit world. I don&#x27;t feel like making this post much larger, so I&#x27;ll just note a brief summary now.<p>* Popcnt -- Provides a &quot;Select Count( * ) from table&quot;, so to speak. 1-clock tick on Skylake, 4-per-clock tick on AMD Zen.<p>* PEXT -- Parallel-Extract, a bitwise gather command. 1-clocktick on Skylake (unfortunately slow on Zen: 18 clocks). This is your &quot;Select&quot; statement. Take the 8-bit (3-column) table 0x9D as an example (10011101-binary). PEXT (10011101b, 10101010b) == 1010, which so happens to be equivalent to &quot;Select A,B from table where C=True&quot;.<p>Some other examples:<p><pre><code>    PEXT (table, 01010101b) is &quot;Select ... where C=False&quot;. \n    PEXT (table, 11001100b) is &quot;Select ... where B=True&quot;. \n    PEXT (table, 11110000b) is &quot;Select ... where A=True&quot;. \n    PEXT (table, 00001111b) is &quot;Select ... where A=False&quot;. \n<\/code><\/pre>\n* PDEP -- Parallel Deposit, a bitwise scatter command. This is the exact opposite of PEXT. If you&#x27;re building a larger table from a smaller one, getting ready for a &quot;join&quot; operation, this is useful. Ex: &quot;Expanding&quot; a hypothetical &quot;AB&quot; table into a &quot;ABC&quot; Table (making room for the new &quot;C&quot; column) can use the PDEP instruction.<p>* Summary: PEXT &quot;Reads many column in parallel&quot;, while PDEP &quot;writes many columns in parallel&quot;.<p>* Where PEXT and PDEP are inefficient (ie: everything outside of Intel chips), a careful mix of bitshift-and-AND operations can implement the above operations with reasonable speed.<p>* BLSR -- Reset lowest bit. The 0x9D table is converted into 0x9C, a useful operator for &quot;iterator++&quot; in C++ terms. For example, 0x9D across repeated BLSR commands changes as follows: 10011101, 10011100, 10011000, 10010000, 10000000, and finally 00000000. See TZCNT for more info.<p>* TZCNT -- Trailing Zero Count. A useful operator for &quot;*iterator&quot; in C++ terms. For example, the TZCNT(10011101) == 0, TZCNT(10011100) == 2, TZCNT(10011000) == 3. To convert fully into ABC column form, simply write out the index in binary. For example, &quot;TZCNT(10011000) == 3&quot;, or 011 in binary (A=false, b=true, c=true).<p>&quot;TZCNT(10010000) == 4&quot; becomes 100 in binary (A=true, b=false, c=false).<p>------<p>64-bit Popcnt, BLSR, TZCNT are all implemented in GPUs by the way. PDEP &#x2F; PEXT is an Intel CPU-only trick, but its definitely one of the coolest operators I&#x27;ve seen.<p>Given that all of these instructions can be implemented in 1-clock tick on most hardware (except PDEP &#x2F; PEXT), it seems important to learn how to use these instructions. Especially if you&#x27;re manipulating logic tables in the form described in the blogpost.<p>-------<p>This area of super-optimized bitmask based programming wraps full-round to Relational Algebra and SQL. Its a very intriguing corner of Comp. Sci for me.<p>Arguably, the classic &quot;Table form&quot; that typical SQL-databases use are simply the sparse-matrix form of these bitmasks I described above. Otherwise, the operators are identical in concept.<p>It also should be noted that hardware exists that executes these bitmask-tables extremely efficiently. Its called an FPGA (which these days, are primarily composed of 6-LUTs, or 6-column look up tables, aka 64-bit numbers).

Magit is part of what I see as its three &quot;killer apps&quot;:<p>- Magit. Best Git UI ever. The other comments in this thread discuss this, so it&#x27;s probably sufficient to remark that it&#x27;s the only serious Git tool competitive with Git&#x27;s own CLI. Equal in power and superior in usability.<p>- Org-mode[0]. Nothing comparable for structured text-editing.<p>- Slime[1]. When you edit Emacs Lisp, you really want its near-perfect features around online documentation, jump-to-definition, code completion, etc. With this foundation you can understand the Emacs internals well enough to build whatever else you need. It gives you the best, most fully-featured REPL-ish workflow (C-x C-e to evaluate the current line of Emacs Lisp) within real source code files I have ever experienced.<p>However, performance issues have kept me from going all-in on my adoption. Mostly this takes the form of long load times upon opening a new file type. Sometimes it&#x27;s simply a new file, since the whole UI will block on parsing&#x2F;analyzing a new source file (depending on the major mode).<p>Guile Emacs[2] seemed like the only real contender to making this workable. But it hasn&#x27;t received enough love over the last 5 years. Guile proper now supports Emacs Lisp, but the Emacs side of the equation still requires custom builds, and doesn&#x27;t support many important features. More importantly, Guile ELisp is still slower than Emacs at running ELisp. The whole project is a dead ringer for high-hopes abandonware.<p>I&#x27;ve moved back to Vim in the meantime, since it reliably opens quickly and never lags on key input. I use a shell for the rest.

One that&#x27;s proven to be a particular puzzle is checked exceptions. But I think I finally understand them now.<p>I quickly found that checked exceptions just do not play nice with any sort of functional-style programming, like the article describes. But the problem goes so much deeper than that. Checked exceptions are also, as far as I can tell, incompatible with an object-oriented programming style. More or less for the same reason that they interact poorly with FP. The fundamental problem is that checked exceptions don&#x27;t really play nice with polymorphism or higher-order programming of any type.<p>Which takes us to the crux of how I understand them now: Checked exceptions may not go well with FP and OOP, but they make all the sense in the world if you&#x27;re doing procedural programming. There, you&#x27;re not trying to create deeply nested abstractions, and you&#x27;re not messing around (much) with polymorphism tricks. The code&#x27;s very lexically organized, with little in the way of dependency injection or higher-order programming. When you&#x27;re programming procedurally, it&#x27;s fine to be exposed to the implementation details of stuff further down on the call graph, because you&#x27;re the one who put it there in the first place.<p>And that, in turn, means that checked exceptions are not really a mistake. They&#x27;re just a piece of evolutionary history. Because, early on, Java wasn&#x27;t <i>really<\/i> an object-oriented language. It was a deeply procedural language with some object-oriented features. It arguably still is, it&#x27;s just that there&#x27;s been a big cultural shift toward trying to take a more object-oriented approach since Java 5 came along and made it more practical to do so."],"time":["2020-09-11 19:07:05"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["crehn"],"id":[24444331],"kids":[24444594,24444399],"parent":[24440536],"text":["While we&#x27;re talking about terrible decisions, can you guess what the following code will print?<p><pre><code>  String s = null;\n  switch (s) {\n      default:\n          System.out.println(&quot;Hey&quot;);\n  }\n<\/code><\/pre>\nHint: it will throw NullPointerException."],"time":["2020-09-11 18:15:46"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["jarym"],"id":[24443725],"kids":[24444421,24444222],"parent":[24440536],"text":["Mistake maybe but I disagree on the ‘biggest’ part.<p>For me type erasure is a bigger issue.

I&#x27;ve done technical interviews with FAANG and the like and those processes actually tend to be much nicer at more mature companies because they&#x27;re actually well designed problems with people who actually understand their significance. You at least get to ask questions and not just get told to jump through the hoop like a dolphin. For the rest, you end up with interviewers who google some esoteric Python problem they think is particularly clever.<p>I&#x27;ll stop here to state that I think any adherence to being overtly clever is my first and only red flag.<p>It&#x27;s so pathetically obvious because the number of times I&#x27;ve done the exact same problem for multiple companies because it happens to be the 2nd or 3rd search result.<p>I once had someone disqualify my answer for using a DFA because it wasn&#x27;t &quot;real code&quot;.<p>To be honest, I think the technical interview actually IS important, and I&#x27;ve had numerous experiences enjoying it if only to showcase a lot of the more necessarily toxic behaviors of a company up front. Let&#x27;s be honest with ourselves, is any employer going to necessarily have the best practices with respecting your time, money and effort? It&#x27;s best to lay out those cards up front. Literally every red flag will demonstrate itself through the interviewer in most scenarios. Like any test, you get out of it what you give.<p>For example:<p>How many times do I feel this?<p>&quot;We take an extra time-slot &#x2F; day &#x2F; email chain in what is already a hypercompetitive market just to suss you out. We wait until the last stage of the interview process to do this because we still don&#x27;t totally trust you or understand anything you&#x27;ve done. We waste a lot of time creating elaborate puzzles that don&#x27;t really matter. We&#x27;re not going to pay you because our finances are already horribly mismanaged that it&#x27;s complicated to contract you out for the day and also we feel like you should be gladly externalizing your labor costs for our shiny position if you really love us. Drink the kool-aid.&quot;<p>Sometimes the technical interview surprises me. I always use it as a motivating example of myself as a candidates to work through a problem, show grit and also demonstrate when to ask for help. Ego and pride on both sides of the equation come into play and that&#x27;s always a worthwhile exercise before engaging it any longterm commitment. A good test accommodates and informs through failure. I learned this from administering the Putnam. Never got a decent score on it, but it was a worthwhile experience to fail. Interview tests are on the other hand, are not designed to teach anything except that you are unworthy.<p>My best roles have never asked for it. The company knew what they were looking for, were willing to trust me, were able to move along the interview process without losing me to a competitor and everyone was happy and they always pay competitively. Usually if there&#x27;s a technical interview involved at all, they have no idea what I can actually do. If they&#x27;re willing to waste time, effort and money on extra steps and are taking &quot;necessary precautions&quot; to subject you to what are essentially just litmus tests, then I&#x27;m sorry, that speaks to me a sense of your culture of mediocrity and dogmatic orthodoxy towards process.<p>Goodhart&#x27;s law. When a measure becomes a target, it stops being a good measure.\nWhen I was in school, we had other students take a year off to study for the Google interview. These were all affluent white men. At the same time, I had recruiters complaining to me that there were no decent black&#x2F;brown candidates in the pipeline. I remember hearing the same thing except as a child. Uhhh, there&#x27;s been plenty of time to invest into the local community. Recruiters would do well do understand to the history of the SAT as systemic racism, or literacy tests as systemic racism, or like any actual statistics as systemic racism. Everything that reduces candidates to numbers and quizzes feels rife for abuse. Who has the privilege to study an extra game on top of performing in a society that is already stacked against them? That&#x27;s not a question.<p>To wit, there&#x27;s the issue with a large number of candidates with junk resumes. There&#x27;s the outstanding issue of &quot;authenticity&quot; in professional acumen. There&#x27;s the whole problem with the industries underlying predatory behavior with regards to labor externalization and laundering numerical metrics, be it the rate of inclusion and diversity or the amount of hours actually demanded by management. What is so fundamentally wrong with the technical interview is that it&#x27;s just the cherry on top for what is already a miserable process. I&#x27;d so much rather just do free work for a potential client and just give it to them so it actually means something and is useful than waste any more time solving pointless puzzles, and this is from someone who specifically enjoyed studying hard pointless puzzles in school.<p>No, you can&#x27;t just show side projects. You should not be showing your work portfolio to anyone who isn&#x27;t paying you. If they were interested in open source, they&#x27;d already be paying you.<p>The technical interview is dead.

There are many good engineers who have not learned how to sell their work, themselves, or in general communicate to the intent of a question. This is an invaluable skill, largely orthogonal to writing code, but it&#x27;s a skill that&#x27;s often learned with experience. Learning to ask level appropriate questions is hard and evaluating answers consistently (if not objectively) even harder. It is also largely insufficient in gauging programming ability. I&#x27;ve had co-workers who can talk about advanced architecture-y topics seemingly competently but struggle to write even relatively simple code.<p>Probationary period - I&#x27;ve never seen this implemented (excluding internships which sort of fall into this category) and it certainly sounds like a nice option to have available but I would bet many candidates would be afraid of a short probationary period (say 3 mo) especially if they have to move their family for the job. Being a professional and being told you are on a probationary period is stressful. At many large companies it can easily take more than 6wks to get up to any sort of productivity.<p>Walk through existing projects - most people (vast majority) do not have any sizable or clean or even &quot;interesting&quot; side project they would want to walk an interviewer through. Unless you worked on open-source for your previous employer (again minority of people) or on your spare time, this is not something you can get a strong signal out of.<p>Ask them to build something - err, I don&#x27;t see how this is that different than a coding challenge. And again, not everyone has personal projects ready to be shown to an interviewer. For example, the game I&#x27;m coding some nights after work does not look anything like code I write for my employer; there are no tests, there&#x27;s a lot of experimental and often dead code, functions are not neatly factored and thought out with an eye for collaboration, etc. I would not want to be judged by this code for an interview.<p>Pair programming - this sounds like a coding challenge but with a more empathetic interviewer. I don&#x27;t think this is an alternative, just a mild augmentation of a coding challenge.<p>Focus on ability to learn - companies do this but it&#x27;s usually considered supplementary to coding ability. Some companies explain their product and try to see if the candidate understands where the value of the product exists or at least where some of the challenges are. This could be spun out into a product type interview or a system design interview depending on intent.<p>Alternatives to white-boarding or do-at-home project interviews:\n- Provide a small existing but functional code base and ask the candidate to implement additional functionality. Downside is this takes a lot more effort to prepare and are limiting the candidate in regards to language they want to use.\n- Provide multiple options for a coding project or question and let the candidate choose which one they want to solve. This would hopefully reduce some of the luck factor of getting a question you know how to solve.\n- I can&#x27;t think of any others, but I&#x27;m sure they exist<p>One of the big desirable goals of interviews are evaluating candidates in a consistent manner. All interviewers have biases and these biases vary between the interviewers. Trying to account for that is, I believe, important but also very hard. Using the proposed alternatives would make it even much harder."],"time":["2020-09-11 22:29:44"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["hnrodey"],"id":[24447412],"kids":{},"parent":[24446123],"text":["so much complaining"],"time":["2020-09-11 23:18:33"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["swyx"],"id":[24445591],"kids":[24446196,24447942],"parent":[24444391],"text":["bit of a rant, but all very reasonable. in general though, i find that people who get this upset about semver tend to view the &quot;contract&quot; of semver to be an ironclad one (right down to being automatically determined by the package ecosystem rather than by the maintainer).<p>I am much more persuaded by the argument (not mine, i get this from more experienced maintainers) that semver is a <i>social<\/i> contract, because what constitutes a bugfix vs a new feature vs a breaking change is exactly as well defined as &quot;what is this piece of code really supposed to do&quot;? aka it&#x27;s not well defined at all. all software &quot;contracts&quot; are underspecified, given enough users and scale.<p>remember Hyrum&#x27;s Law: &quot;With a sufficient number of users of an API, it does not matter what you promise in the contract - all observable behaviors of your system will be depended on by somebody.&quot; Even bugs will be relied on and people get pissy about semver when you break them!"],"time":["2020-09-11 20:10:11"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["sz4kerto"],"id":[24446030],"kids":[24446103,24446163],"parent":[24444391],"text":["I don&#x27;t like semver.<p>If the library follows the rules, then...<p>Separation of minor and patch versions doesn&#x27;t make sense.

Just because lots of systems are Turing complete doesn&#x27;t at all imply that intelligent life or even life in general is likely to arise from a random initial state. There&#x27;s no support in the post for this jump in logic.<p>I think the solution to the Fermi paradox is that intelligent life is just spectacularly unlikely, and that we&#x27;re the only intelligent life in the observable universe. I think most people reason that we&#x27;re probably not that special, that our conditions aren&#x27;t too rare, and that the likelihood of intelligent life given those conditions must be somewhat good, but I don&#x27;t think any of this reasoning is valid given the anthropic principle.

In that case, we would be more likely to find ourselves in a universe where life was more plentiful. But if there were a tighter range of possible constant values that create a universe with any life at all, then I would expect less variation with only universes with rare lonely life.
