The implication is that a GPT model with &gt;1 trillion parameters would begin to see a reduction in data efficiency. I have read all the GPT related papers and I’m frankly not sure what nostalgebraist thinks this would mean, practically speaking. All complex problem domains begin to see a dropoff in data efficiency once the “easy” structure is successfully learned. The lesson here might simply be that GPT type models are close (within an order of magnitude, so “close” is subjective) to being able to learn all the “obvious” regularities in massive language datasets, leaving the increasingly subtle regularities that might require very specific, very difficult-to-reach-through-local-minima-ravines, or very “big” learned abstractions to discover.

I found this one: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;deepai.org&#x2F;publication&#x2F;a-proposal-for-intelligent-agents-with-episodic-memory\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;deepai.org&#x2F;publication&#x2F;a-proposal-for-intelligent-ag...<\/a><p>GPT-2 was a solution to a certain kind of problem: is it possible to throw out the idea of representing language while still having good performance on a variety of language tasks? But there doesn&#x27;t seem to be anything like that for &quot;memory,&quot; which seems separate and distinct from &quot;tasks.&quot;<p>In concrete terms, I&#x27;m interested in models that have memory in the sense of &quot;When you inference from the model, you leave a lasting impact on the model.&quot; Inferencing from the model should cause a change in the model parameters. Yet most models currently seem to assume that model parameters can be frozen without losing something essential to the end goal.<p>We&#x27;re very task-oriented. But none of these chat bots can remember my name, or anything about me, and it&#x27;s always bugged me. GPT-2 (and now GPT-3) punts the problem to a sufficiently clever programmer: just figure out how to encode all the &quot;memory&quot; into the context window, and then out pops the results you want. But that feels rather like arguing &quot;Just come up with a technique that works, and it will work.&quot; Perhaps it&#x27;s true, but not too helpful.<p>If you hear the same name a few times, you&#x27;ll remember it a long time, and start associating it with someone&#x27;s face. It seems like language models could do something similar. I don&#x27;t know precisely what; maybe someone here does.<p>You could designate part of the model as long-term memory, short-term, etc. Inferencing from the model could cause larger effects in the short-term area than the long-term area (equivalent to a higher learning rate)."],"time":["2020-06-04 10:00:23"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["ladberg"],"id":[23400321],"kids":[23413714,23418353,23413811,23413505,23413492],"parent":[23400042],"text":["The author mentions that the shape of the curve from 117M parameters to 175B is interesting, but doesn&#x27;t show it.

If the input string begins with &quot;0x&quot; or &quot;0X&quot; (a zero, followed by lowercase or uppercase X), radix is assumed to be 16 and the rest of the string is parsed as a hexidecimal number.<\/i><p><i>2. If the input string begins with &quot;0&quot; (a zero), radix is assumed to be 8 (octal) or 10 (decimal). Exactly which radix is chosen is implementation-dependent. ECMAScript 5 clarifies that 10 (decimal) should be used, but not all browsers support this yet. For this reason, always specify a radix when using parseInt.<\/i><p><i>3. If the input string begins with any other value, the radix is 10 (decimal).<\/i><p>1: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;docs&#x2F;Web&#x2F;JavaScript&#x2F;Reference&#x2F;Global_Objects&#x2F;parseInt\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;docs&#x2F;Web&#x2F;JavaScript&#x2F;Refe...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-06-04 09:57:23"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["vsviridov"],"id":[23411168],"kids":[23411396],"parent":[23409708],"text":["None of those are mysteries and have been demonstrated years and years ago...

The number of higher order consequences of defunding the police are mind-boggling. Insurance costs will obviously skyrocket for one, if policies even continue to be offered at all.

The folks calling for defunding are small in number and do not represent the views of all or even most of the &quot;People&quot;.

Here in Seattle, given the sharp increase in property crimes and blight over the last ten years, I would like to see the opposite - increased policing and increased prosecution. It&#x27;s an especially big problem since most people are so jaded from the total lack of police response, that they simply no longer report property crimes.<p>We&#x27;ve already hamstrung our justice system due to calls from activists. For example, the city regularly releases criminals instead of sentencing them, which resulted in infuriating situations, like a man with 74 prior convictions including 15 assaults being released, only to then throw hot coffee at a toddler (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;komonews.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;project-seattle&#x2F;no-felony-charges-for-repeat-offender-who-threw-coffee-at-toddler-in-seattle\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;komonews.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;project-seattle&#x2F;no-felony-charges-...<\/a>).

Two of the questions on the first graphic are about income mobility for people born in the bottom quantile. The graphic is correct, as far as it goes, but overlooks huge differences by race. While the average American born in the bottom 20% has a 7.8% chance of reaching the top 20%, that number is actually 25% for Asians.<p>Or, take the fact that the US lags Denmark in inter generational income mobility. Which is true, but it’s also true that the difference is due mainly to taxes and transfers flattening the whole distribution instead of fundamental structural differences that enable more movement: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.brookings.edu&#x2F;blog&#x2F;social-mobility-memos&#x2F;2016&#x2F;09&#x2F;23&#x2F;denmerica-why-denmark-plus-america-could-be-the-mobility-utopia&#x2F;amp\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.brookings.edu&#x2F;blog&#x2F;social-mobility-memos&#x2F;2016&#x2F;09...<\/a>. Put differently, it’s not that the welfare system allows the son of a gardener to become an engineer, but that massive income redistribution reduces the disparity between gardeners and engineers. (For many Americans, that distinction could be dispositive in whether you support an expanded welfare system.)<p>So take these facts the next step. The authors studied these things in the context of support for reducing income inequality. Isn’t there a very plausible argument here that the experience of poor Asians shows that there isn’t a systemic structural problem keeping people in the bottom 20%? Or, isn’t it plausible that the generous welfare state doesn’t really fundamentally change people’s’ trajectories, but just reduces the divergence between those trajectories? And if you teach people the first set of statistics but not the second, are you educating them to make up their own minds, or feeding them facts to support a preconceived notion?<p>Stepping back: experts should certainly understand these facts. But what do we expect ordinary people to take away from them? Consider the work done by Piketty and Saez on income inequality: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vox.com&#x2F;policy-and-politics&#x2F;2018&#x2F;1&#x2F;10&#x2F;16850050&#x2F;inequality-tax-return-data-saez-piketty\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vox.com&#x2F;policy-and-politics&#x2F;2018&#x2F;1&#x2F;10&#x2F;16850050&#x2F;i...<\/a>. Defining &quot;income equality&quot; actually is quite a quagmire. For example, in their 2003 work, P&amp;S excluded the effect of tax transfers (such as the earned income tax credit) which significantly overstated the degree of inequality. Or, they mention that marginal tax rates were higher in the 1960s, but exclude the fact that the tax bases were narrower, such that the actual average tax rate on the top 1% hasn&#x27;t changed dramatically over the decades: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;taxfoundation.org&#x2F;taxes-on-the-rich-1950s-not-high\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;taxfoundation.org&#x2F;taxes-on-the-rich-1950s-not-high<\/a>. And there are so many other confounding variables to account for. The immigrant population today is almost triple what it was in 1960. Because immigrants often start at the bottom of the ladder, an increasing immigrant share could make incomes seem stagnant even though they’re growing within each different demographic. You also need to account for household sizes, major differences in marriage rates, etc. There are an enormous number of variables.<p>I&#x27;m not trying to take a side on this issue, I&#x27;m just using it as an example. These are issues of vast complexity. The facts are things experts can fight over. But do we really expect people to make political choices based on this information? Invocation of &quot;facts&quot; and &quot;experts&quot; have an intuitive appeal, but the &quot;fact&quot; is that for almost any disputed political issue, the facts are far from clear. So people use heuristics: ideologies, knee-jerk reactions, general principles, values.

(I use the dates rather than page numbers in the table of contents.)  I&#x27;ve been doing this since about 2005.  Everything goes into the same notebook: notes on &quot;virtual virtual memory&quot; (2020-01-28), notes on foreign exchange rates here in Argentina (2020-01-28), notes on prices of laptops in the store (2020-01-28), a list of things to fix (toilet, clothing, remote control) (2020-01-30), designs for flexural dial indicators (2020-02-01), an explanation of Cantor&#x27;s diagonalization proof (2020-02-06), thoughts on multitouch UX design (202-02-06), etc.  I don&#x27;t write anything private in the notebook, so I can show it to people.

A few years later, my girlfriend admired the BRÜGGE notebooks in a store; I warned her, but she wanted one.  The same thing happened to her, so it wasn&#x27;t just a temporary quality mixup — the company is really targeting that abysmal level of quality!  Unfortunately BRÜGGE is displacing Moleskine from more and more stationery shops here.  (I got mine from Librería Artística Catalinas for US$16; I think they have relocated now to Córdoba 746, Capital Federal.  That&#x27;s also where I got the mechanical pencil, although they didn&#x27;t have any leads harder than HB.)<p>Lately I haven&#x27;t been keeping my address book in the notebook, but when I did, I used a hash table with separate chaining; I numbered the lines in the address-book section, and had a &quot;successor&quot; column.  At the beginning of the address book was the hash table itself, a matrix whose rows are groups of first letters (of the person&#x27;s name) and whose columns are groups of third letters; so &quot;María&quot; whoever would end up in row LM, column QR.  If she was the first person in that cell, I&#x27;d just write the line number there, but if not, I would add her as a successor at the end of the chain.  Difficult to explain (especially to non-programmers) but easy to update and search.  Insertion is not worst-case constant time because you can&#x27;t insert at the beginning of the chain — the paper is WORM rather than strictly read&#x2F;write.<p>Here&#x27;s a sample page, in Spanish, photographed at 5 megapixels: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;is.gd&#x2F;nbshot\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;is.gd&#x2F;nbshot<\/a><p>Notes on my computerized notetaking practices are at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23388381\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23388381<\/a>"],"time":["2020-06-04 04:00:31"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["nicbou"],"id":[23422419],"kids":{},"parent":[23401019],"text":["I still take most of my notes in Google Keep.

How are we to account for this paradox? Think of the situation known to most of us from our youth: the unfortunate child who, on Sunday afternoon, has to visit his grandmother instead of being allowed to play with friends. The old-fashioned authoritarian father’s message to the reluctant boy would have been: “I don’t care how you feel. Just do your duty, go to grandmother and behave there properly!” In this case, the child’s predicament is not bad at all: although forced to do something he clearly doesn’t want to, he will retain his inner freedom and the ability to (later) rebel against the paternal authority. Much more tricky would have been the message of a “postmodern” non-authoritarian father: “You know how much your grandmother loves you! But, nonetheless, I do not want to force you to visit her – go there only if you really want to!” Every child who is not stupid (and as a rule they are definitely not stupid) will immediately recognize the trap of this permissive attitude: beneath the appearance of a free choice there is an even more oppressive demand than the one formulated by the traditional authoritarian father, namely an implicit injunction not only to visit the grandmother, but to do it voluntarily, out of the child’s own free will. Such a false free choice is the obscene superego injunction: it deprives the child even of his inner freedom, ordering him not only what to do, but what to want to do."],"time":["2020-06-04 11:53:35"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["twic"],"id":[23415094],"kids":[23415481,23415389,23415995],"parent":[23414160],"text":["I have come to see postmodernism and critical theory and all that stuff not as inquiry, but as a game.<p>Usually, academia is inquiry: physicists are inquiring into how matter and energy work, historians are inquiring into what happened and why, etc. From a distance, postmodern philosophy looks like it is inquiring into how society works, what hidden assumptions we have, etc.<p>But it isn&#x27;t, really.

One should always distinguish valid applications such as Postmodernist Architecture, which is a very distinctive movement that does push forward certain concepts that existed in the Modernist architecture (you can look up the Bateson building and the philosophy behind it). \nPostmodernism in contemporary art is a much weaker application, in a sense that to kind of put every post-war artist(or post 70&#x27;s) under this moniker doesn&#x27;t really achieve much.<p>The article discusses something which came to prominence not so long ago, the inclusion of the radical ideas in the mainstream left-wing discourse in States. I don&#x27;t want to touch the identity&#x2F;gender politics part here, but the death of meta-narrative the author attributes to Lyotard is an interesting part.<p>What her main problem is if I understood that correctly - there are a number of ideas and symbols, which are close to the heart of &quot;liberal democrat&quot;, and there is a certain metanarrative that she holds as true. And that is being attacked by relativists and deconstructionists.\nWhat are those symbols - Equality, Freedom, Science, Reason. And the metanarrative is the Path of Progress, move from the darkness to the light of civilization.<p>Yet all of these symbols are quite problematic. Freedom often means free market and representative democracy and in extreme cases neoliberal worldview. Civilization served as the main excuse for subjugating the natives. Language of science was deployed to effectively introduce questionable government social policies by using &quot;objective&quot;, &quot;approved by experts&quot; approach.\nMost of the slaves were sold in the Age of Enlightenment yet in the &quot;bad&quot; Dark Ages and Middle ages slavery was almost non-existent in the western world.<p>My issue with her worldview is that she sincerely believes that good things that happened during Modern age - progress of sciences and bad things - Belgian Congo, for example, are not the inverse side of the same coin but are totally unrelated.<p>James Watt research into steam was funded by slavery, not in a metaphorical sense but literally - his research was funded by plantation owners, and he himself had profited from slave trade."],"time":["2020-06-05 16:04:07"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["ericwaller"],"id":[23411486],"kids":[23412529,23411903,23412405],"parent":[23409309],"text":["I&#x27;m one of SeatGeek&#x27;s cofounders, good question.<p>It was indeed Apple&#x27;s &quot;Sign In with Apple&quot; deadline that prompted us to make the change (for those who don&#x27;t know, apps that offer sign in via a third party auth mechanism will also need to offer sign in with Apple), but it&#x27;s something we&#x27;ve considered on and off for many years.<p>Two big reasons.

But we now live in a world, where money essentially has no bounds to reality anymore. It is tied to nothing, but it is the driver of everything.<p>The Fed and other central banks, are used to print money out of thin air, and give it to banks, to lend out, or to buy back loans from corporations.<p>People blindly believe that this will not cause inflation, but instead, it drives up asset inflation, which drives up the cost of everything else.  This is the hidden inflation, that takes money out of your pocket, and is beyond your control.<p>This is where the government needs to step in and put in policies to protect the people.<p>Instead of GDP, we need to measure QOL, or the Quality of Life.<p>This is the measure of how well the median person’s quality of life is, in terms of how much they earn, and how much their rent and mortgage is.  As well as other factors like, access to modern basic necessities: electricity, shelter, clothing, healthcare, transportation, communication, and food.<p>No person, should be required to spend over 50% of their income on housing.  There is just no money left over afterwards to pay for anything else.  You will forever be, bound to a life of poverty and destitution, as well as your children.<p>Additionally, we need to remove housing as an investment vehicle. Instead of creating wealth for all, this has become the driver of massive inequality.<p>Housing needs to be for people to live in, and not for speculation. The government should mandate the building of more housing, to increase availability, and to drive down costs.  And people should be able to afford and own their own homes.  And maybe to kickstart a post-industrial society, the government should back the mortgage, where you just need to work a meaningful job in society, for 20 years, and the house is yours.  The government will pick up the remaining tab on the house afterwards.<p>This will give you a home, and the security you need to be safe and whole.  You can raise your family and your children, without the fear of poverty, or crime, or a lifetime servitude of debt.<p>And for things like food, the vegetables and fruits, can be grown in massive automated vertical farms.  And one day, tended to by robots, for monitoring and harvesting.  No more need for back breaking labor performed by humans.  Let the robots do all the work.  The software for it will be developed by programmers, and the fruits and vegetables will be monitored by using adaptive machine learning software.<p>These are bold challenges, and we need bold leaders to think beyond their myopic economic view of the world, where they only think of enriching themselves and their cronies, and actually do their job to govern, and to lead and guide the people."],"time":["2020-06-04 11:39:13"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["mydongle"],"id":[23413410],"kids":{},"parent":[23413076],"text":["How about $100m in the pockets of impoverished people who actually need it, regardless of race&#x2F;skin color? :)"],"time":["2020-06-04 08:50:41"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["RivasPT"],"id":[23414105],"kids":{},"parent":[23413076],"text":["Why jornalists write &quot;minorities&quot; and not &quot;Black and Latino&quot;?

They are flat phased array antennas, and don&#x27;t need to be precisely pointed like satellite dishes do. They are about the size of an extra-large pizza, so you won&#x27;t be able to get a Starlink phone.<p>The user antennas are likely to be quite expensive at first (several thousand dollars). Cost reduction of the user antennas is the biggest hurdle Starlink currently faces. Nobody knows yet how much SpaceX will charge for the antenna or service.<p>Starlink can&#x27;t support a high density of users, so it will not be an alternative to ISPs in cities. Rural and mobile use are the important applications. The US military is doing trials with it. Cell tower backhaul may also be a possibility.<p>Starlink V1 doesn&#x27;t have cross-satellite links, so the satellites can only provide service while over a ground station. There will be hundreds of ground stations in North America; no information about other regions yet. Starlink V2 is planned to have laser links between satellites, which will enable 100% global coverage 24&#x2F;7, though local regulations are likely to prevent SpaceX from providing service in many places.<p>Because the speed of light in a vacuum is 30% faster than in optical fiber, the latency of Starlink over long distances has the potential to be lower than any other option once laser links are available.<p>Each launch of 60 Starlink satellites has nearly as much solar panel area as the International Space Station. Once SpaceX&#x27;s Starship is operational they should be able to launch several hundred satellites at once instead of just 60.<p>Starlink&#x27;s only current competitor, OneWeb, just filed for bankruptcy after only launching a handful of satellites, and is fishing for acquisition offers. Amazon is also planning something called Project Kuiper but not much is known about it.<p>Starlink V2 will have 30,000 satellites, requiring hundreds of launches. Even once the initial fleet is launched, SpaceX will still need to maintain the constellation with many launches per year indefinitely.<p>SpaceX&#x27;s FCC application has many interesting details: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;licensing.fcc.gov&#x2F;myibfs&#x2F;download.do?attachment_key=2378669\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;licensing.fcc.gov&#x2F;myibfs&#x2F;download.do?attachment_key=...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-06-04 02:22:32"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["jessriedel"],"id":[23411026],"kids":[23411089,23411079,23411550],"parent":[23409063],"text":["Could someone explain the technical notability beyond what can be inferred from the Wikipedia page?<p>&gt; An autonomous system (AS) is a collection of connected Internet Protocol (IP) routing prefixes under the control of one or more network operators on behalf of a single administrative entity or domain that presents a common, clearly defined routing policy to the internet.<p>&gt; Originally the definition required control by a single entity, typically an Internet service provider (ISP) or a very large organization with independent connections to multiple networks....

For the software, it only matters that its been fully tested, including random bit flips and hardware failure.<p>From a cost savings perspective, its vastly cheaper to verify that 3 touchscreens are working correctly than the 600 switches they replace."],"time":["2020-06-03 23:32:51"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["randtrain34"],"id":[23405262],"kids":[23405557],"parent":[23403800],"text":["Note that the data within the post is from an AMA <i><\/i><i>7 years ago<\/i><i><\/i>"],"time":["2020-06-03 18:27:22"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["wlesieutre"],"id":[23404279],"kids":[23404511,23404740,23404611,23404298],"parent":[23403800],"text":["Interesting read.

I&#x27;d be happy to answer any questions you might have, either here or on <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bugs.chromium.org&#x2F;p&#x2F;skia&#x2F;issues&#x2F;detail?id=10301\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bugs.chromium.org&#x2F;p&#x2F;skia&#x2F;issues&#x2F;detail?id=10301<\/a> where we&#x27;ve been trying to think about how much Skia&#x27;s involved with the root cause of this bug.<p>There&#x27;s no &quot;Skia color profile&quot; per se.  When Skia&#x27;s asked to write a JPEG from a pixel buffer tagged with a color profile (SkColorSpace), we auto-generate an ICC profile programatically from the parameters that describe the color gamut and transfer functions we use to represent those color profiles.  That&#x27;s what the code in this file is up to: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;source.chromium.org&#x2F;chromium&#x2F;chromium&#x2F;src&#x2F;+&#x2F;master:third_party&#x2F;skia&#x2F;src&#x2F;core&#x2F;SkICC.cpp\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;source.chromium.org&#x2F;chromium&#x2F;chromium&#x2F;src&#x2F;+&#x2F;master:t...<\/a><p>So this profile is one of infinite possible profiles that&#x27;ll have &quot;Google&#x2F;Skia&#x2F;..big long MD5..&quot; somewhere in them.<p>This profile in particular looks like it&#x27;s probably describing the ProPhoto color space, which is very, very large and uses imaginary colors outside visible light to increase its gamut.  While the JPEG itself is always storing values in range in the ProPhoto gamut, when you convert that to another gamut (say, to match the display, or to sRGB) it&#x27;s very easy to end up with logical color channel values less than zero or greater than one, which do make a kind of sense, but not to code that expects colors are always sRGB bytes.<p>It&#x27;s unclear to me what gamut the colors being read in that Java code are in,\nand that&#x27;d very much affect what the appropriate values for that LUMINOSITY_MATRIX should be.  Those are the correct values to get the luminosity for sRGB colors (though I think what&#x27;s being calculated here is subtly-different gamma-encoded &quot;luma&quot; instead), but they&#x27;re not likely a sound way to get luminosity if the image is in any different gamut.  A typical strategy is to convert any image you load to the display gamut early, since you&#x27;ll need to do that eventually to display it.  And it&#x27;s more and more common that phone display gamuts are not sRGB, usually something wider now like Display P3."],"time":["2020-06-03 18:55:56"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["Someone"],"id":[23404880],"kids":[23405073,23406704,23405432,23408791],"parent":[23404432],"text":["<i>“Restarting the device in safe mode (by holding down the volume button during boot-up) did not fix the issue.”<\/i><p>So, lesson learned: in safe mode, do not use a background image that the user set."],"time":["2020-06-03 17:58:39"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["AdmiralAsshat"],"id":[23404745],"kids":[23404886,23410165,23404846,23407714],"parent":[23404432],"text":["Granted we understand &quot;brick&quot; to mean the device cannot boot, but this comes pretty damn close on some phones, it seems.<p>&gt; &quot;After setting the image in question as a wallpaper, the phone immediately crashed.

This last does not mean that simple concentration of the means of production and of the command over labour, which is identical with accumulation. It is concentration of capitals already formed, destruction of their individual independence, expropriation of capitalist by capitalist, transformation of many small into few large capitals. This process differs from the former in this, that it only presupposes a change in the distribution of capital already on hand, and functioning; its field of action is therefore not limited by the absolute growth of social wealth, by the absolute limits of accumulation. Capital grows in one place to a huge mass in a single hand, because it has in another place been lost by many. This is the centralization proper, as distinct from accumulation and concentration.<p>The laws of this centralization of capitals, or of the attraction of capital by capital, cannot be developed here. A brief hint at a few facts must suffice. The battle of competition is fought by cheapening of commodities. The cheapness of commodities depends, coeteris pribus, on the productiveness of labour, and this again on the scale of production. Therefore, the larger capitals beat the smaller. It will further be remembered that, with the development of the capitalist mode of production, there is an increase in the minimum amount of individual capital necessary to carry on a business under its normal conditions. The smaller capitals, therefore, crowd into spheres of production which Modern Industry has only sporadically or incompletely got hold of. Here competition rages in direct proportion to the number, and the inverse proportion to the magnitudes, of the antagonistic capitals. It always ends in the ruin of many small capitalists, whose capitals partly pass into the hand of their conquerors, partly vanish. Apart from this, with capitalist production an altogether new force comes into play - the credit system.<p>In its beginnings, the credit system sneaks in as a modest helper of accumulation and draws by invisible threads the money resources scattered all over the surface of society into the hands of individual or associated capitalists. But soon it becomes a new and formidable weapon in the competitive struggle, and finally it transforms itself into an immense social mechanism for centralization of capitals."],"time":["2020-06-03 18:44:39"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["Proven"],"id":[23406196],"kids":{},"parent":[23403455],"text":["That alleged trend doesn&#x27;t concern me at all.<p>What concerns me is my declining power vs. State power."],"time":["2020-06-03 19:37:23"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["tryptophan"],"id":[23404274],"kids":[23404429,23405224,23404484],"parent":[23403455],"text":["This seems like a political piece.<p>There is no mention of how the decline in worker share is due to a rise in real-eastate income share, not due to monopolies or corporations or capitalism or billionaires. &quot;Due to&quot; is maybe a strong way of putting it, but that&#x27;s where the share from the decrease went.<p>For some reason everyone seems to accept the idea that just being there first and buying land first somehow entitles you to eternally increasing prices and rents for that land, even when you do literally nothing to improve it&#x27;s value(hello, &#x27;historic&#x27; parking lots in SF).

I love it. Gnome continues to improve a lot with each release, and overall the operating system feels very stable. I can&#x27;t think of the last time I saw any error.<p>- This machine doesn&#x27;t have great battery life regardless of what OS you are running, but after properly configuring the GPU, battery life on linux is on par with Windows if not a bit better. I&#x27;ve also undervolted the cpu, which is easy to do and provides even better batter life.<p>- I was able to install all the software I needed using a combination of the Fedora rpm repositories, rpmfusion, and flathub. I actually have come to prefer flatpaks over other installation methods for software like bitwarden, spotify, riot, slack, etc. I don&#x27;t notice the same performance issues I have seen with snaps on Ubuntu. I install Steam from rpmfusion, and am surprised at how nice the linux gaming experience is these days.<p>There are a few things that are less than stellar, though.<p>- It takes a little work to get decent battery life because of the nvidia gpu, and the setup isn&#x27;t perfect. External displays must be run of the discrete gpu, so you can&#x27;t get them to work if you are just running off the integrated intel chip, which provides the best battery life. In fact, external displays don&#x27;t work when using &quot;prime offloading&quot; either. You need to set the nvidia gpu as the primary gpu to get external displays to work. What this all adds up to is that I need to change a config value and log out&#x2F;back in depending on whether I am plugged in to an external display or not. I have a script that does this so it isn&#x27;t that bad.<p>Interestingly, with the latest kernel release the nouveau driver is working for my nvidia card and, at least according to powertop, is able to dynamically switch from power-saving to primary mode when an external display is connected. I am also hopeful nvidia will resolve this in the next release.<p>- Docker is still a pain to set up on 32. There&#x27;s no docker-ce repo, but you can install from the Fedora 31 repos, and to get it to work some system and firewall configuration is required. This is all pretty well documented in a github issue now, but it took a lot of troubleshooting at first.<p>That&#x27;s my experience, and it has improved a lot since the machine first came out and I was running Fedora 30. There were initially several serious firmware bugs which took a long time to get resolved, and the OS&#x2F;driver support was not nearly as good as it is now. Overall, I would recommend this combo if you need a powerful machine."],"time":["2020-06-03 17:11:21"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["wilsonfiifi"],"id":[23407847],"kids":[23407960],"parent":[23401258],"text":["What’s dual (or multiple) monitor Support like with Linux these days?

Sadly all these mitigations don&#x27;t work because Google already has a dossier on many people and even if you don&#x27;t have a Google account, Google keeps tabs on you via fingerprinting or other means and knows who &#x27;you&#x27; really are (using simple correlation and heuristics).<p>Then this raises the issue of: what can be done?
