But I think it&#x27;s high time, the likes of Twitter, Facebook et al got a good kicking.<p>To be fair, the problem is not with the sites themselves. They are private companies and [within the law] can do whatever the hell they like with regard to who can use their platforms and what they can say while doing so.<p>The problem is that these type of sites [and especially Twitter] have been elevated by the rest of the world and transformed from being outlets for vacuous chatter into being the official conduit for &#x27;news&#x27;, for any lazy journalist who can&#x27;t be bothered to research a story properly.<p>Even on such esteemed organisations as the BBC and Reuters, it&#x27;s becoming increasingly common to see news articles in which the &#x27;sources&#x27; are little more than lists of what various parties said on Twitter.  And on a smaller and even local level, more and more companies are only contactable through their Twitter accounts or Facebook pages. I even got message from the UK Government&#x27;s unemployment service a few days ago, informing me that they would be announcing nee vacancies on their Twitter account, from now on.<p>Now, as I said, that&#x27;s not Twitter or Facebook&#x27;s fault.  It&#x27;s the rest of the worlds fault for increasingly elevating them to this pseudo-official status. But it does create the situation whereby anyone who&#x27;s not on Twitter or Facebook is increasingly disenfranchised from having their viewpoint heard or from participating in the great and small issues of the day.<p>And what if Twitter or Facebook decide to ban a user or suspend an account? That user has no recourse but to plead with the company in question to reinstate them, which is entirely arbitrary decision. There is no legal recourse, as there would be if some authority tried to remove a person&#x27;s vote or to ban them from speaking, writing or otherwise putting forward their opinions in the &#x27;real world&#x27;.<p>As chance would have it, I&#x27;ve run into this myself.  About a year ago, I logged into my Twitter account to find that it had been suspended as had my business Twitter account --with no reason given and nothing that I had done [that I can see] to have justified this.  I never verbally attacked anyone or posted anything dodgy. I can only think my accounts were mistakenly caught up in one of Twitter&#x27;s periodic automated sweeps, after which they proudly announce they&#x27;ve removed X-million bot accounts.<p>The only recourse is to fill in a form asking them to review the account suspension. Which, needless to say results in nothing but an autoreply, assigning you a case number.  And then... nothing.<p>Likewise, as chance would have it, just today I logged into a Facebook page I&#x27;d set up for my business to find a message saying that had been suspended for &quot;suspicious activity&quot;.  Again, nothing I can see that i&#x27;ve done that could possibly justify that. In fact, I don&#x27;t do FB at all. So I don&#x27;t even interact with that account apart from to occasionally post links to the latest &#x27;thing&#x27; I&#x27;ve made and am selling on Amazon.  I&#x27;ve not even added any friends to my FB account, so I couldn&#x27;t have &#x27;offended&#x27; any one! In order to lift that suspension I was asked to verify my mobile phone number [OK... with great reluctance] and then upload a photograph of myself, so they can &#x27;verify&#x27; me [WTF? Am i applying for a passport to the fucking internet now?<p>Now, I know those last few paragraphs sound like I&#x27;m just whining and crying because I can&#x27;t use Twitter or Facebook any more.

It&#x27;s where they talk to their friends, where they arrange their social lives, where they do their shopping, where they read their news, where they run their businesses and where they exist online. So, sometimes, you&#x27;ve just got to swallow the rising vomit and at least establish a token presence there, just so people know you exist.<p>Anyway, given that&#x27;s the state we&#x27;re in, should all that vast mass of human commerce and interaction be dependent on the whims of a couple of monstrously rich individuals and a couple of monstrously rich corporations? It&#x27;s a toughie.<p>On the one hand, I&#x27;m generally opposed to government interference in how people run their lives or their businesses.

Someone emails, someone has a question, someone has a clarification, etc.<p>Now if we assume same locale, that drastically changes the game since everyone can communicate at the same time even if remote. Therefore, my point#1 is, a global distributed teams that are across time zones really don&#x27;t make sense.<p>Keeping in line with the article, let&#x27;s say a company decides to outsource all these different professions. That would mean, you&#x27;re even outsourcing management, people that need to oversee are needed to the same region. How high does one go? All the way to directors of each respective field or Vice President? Maybe we go as far as till we reach an owner for a service or product for that region. This is what happens basically today (pre-covid). Each region has a focus in a deliverable. India team is working on X, China team is working on Y, etc. So point#2, outsourcing has to happen not only for people that are executing work, but for people that are overseeing the execution as well.<p>That finally gets me to the last point. If we have these vertical&#x27;s of people localized to specific regions, you cannot have specific outsourcing of jobs. You would need a batch outsourcing of jobs from IC&#x27;s to managers. However, each region a company is in, requires locale specific folks to solve specific problems. Amazon US is very different than Amazon India pay after you receive package, for example. So my point#3, I don&#x27;t believe we will see too much of a shift for jobs to other countries. We might see a shift in jobs from California to Texas for example.<p>By now, you might understand where i&#x27;m going :-). If you hired enough of a presence in mid-west, suddenly, you now have a pool of candidates that competitors, and other companies can also hire from. You as a company, unless you can spin an entirely new vertical, will back-fill employees from the mid-west again since the remaining team is located in that region. Thereby creating a pocket of talent. Enough pockets of talents will create many companies that want to hire that talent. This is what we effectively have today in major cities.

One is paying for a cheaper labor market. The second is paying for less skilled people. Most of the projected cost savings come from the latter. Most of those projected cost savings don&#x27;t appear. I remember folks hiring $10&#x2F;hr DBAs in India and the result was about what you&#x27;d expect. India is full of great DBAs and they ain&#x27;t charging $10&#x2F;hr or at least they haven&#x27;t for a long time. It is the case that you can access a cheaper labor pool. Most people do this and then negate that savings by not creating a remote-first culture and introducing massive language and time zone barriers and friction due to multiple companies interacting.<p>Offshoring: The key difference here is that these are part of your company. In the US it&#x27;s totally possible to set up an office in central&#x2F;south america in-timezone and staff it with amazing people and save some money. Well, except for most of those folks who are willing to relocate will eventually accept offers with FANG companies either locally or relocate. So it&#x27;s a nice scheme while it works. (Hi to all my tico friends now at Google and Amazon)<p>Remote: this is what most people confuse for the above two things. Remote is about doing 2 things.<p>1) Expanding your hiring pool beyond a 30 minute commute from your office (turns out that the other 99.99% of the world&#x27;s population also has some great folks).<p>2) Making your company culture remote-first. But that&#x27;s synonymous with writing things down and documenting things.<p>Sure interpersonal relationships can be trickier to bootstrap and that&#x27;s a real cost. But see #1, nobody talks about that cost.<p>The final thing to keep in mind is that for most big companies, there&#x27;s no way to avoid the remote cost.

Most privacy policies include a quite wide allowance for disclosure in the event of sales, mergers, etc.[1] Consider adding clauses to your privacy policy providing users with strong data controls if you end up in a situation like this, even if it will make those your organization less valuable in these situations. This is a very tough call to make, of course, you&#x27;re making yourself less attractive to people who can bail you out when you&#x27;re most in need of bailing, but a more equitable relationship with your users may build enough trust in your product to keep from needing to be bailed :)<p>How do you design your systems so that they grow to be more privacy-preserving over time? Large&#x2F;&quot;global&quot; tech companies will consider this in their security threat modeling, that e.g. anyone with root can dump the database, but even companies of 20-200 employees should be considering internal attacks like this. Businesses operating in complicated regulatory environments inevitably end up with some business-person running SQL against production once a week to get a CSV to send to a regulator, what else can they (or someone with their access) do with enough time and Stack Overflow?<p>I&#x27;m a big fan of considering and expressing privacy values (along with other values of your organization&#x27;s choice!) in the entire business lifecycle, not just in the code+infrastructure, adopting privacy by design[2] methodologies in to your product design lifecycle, for example, if you&#x27;ve already started. But if you&#x27;re a small company or a single-person side-dish, considering these things from the very beginning will pay in dividends as time goes on.<p>So much of this advice comes down to &quot;treat your customers and potential customers with respect and dignity.&quot; I&#x27;m one of those weirdos who read the T&amp;C and privacy policy before i sign up for most services, and I&#x27;m always taken aback by 1) how ambiguous they all are (in favor of the business) 2) how same-y they all are 3) how often they simply don&#x27;t function [3]. I think that if business wants to continue to rely on the idea of &quot;informed consent&quot; for our data regulatory frameworks, we must be encouraged to build more transparent, informative controls for users, starting with those tiny fucking check-boxes at the bottom of every signup page.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.freeprivacypolicy.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;privacy-policy-business-transfer-clause&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.freeprivacypolicy.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;privacy-policy-busine...<\/a><p>[2]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Privacy_by_design#Foundational_principles_in_detail\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Privacy_by_design#Foundational...<\/a><p>[3]: One example: F1TV, the Formula 1 online streaming service&#x27;s signup page didn&#x27;t have working links to the PP or T&amp;C, their cookie control tool didn&#x27;t work, and their contact email address didn&#x27;t respond to multiple requests for a copy of the contracts.

I’ve been running a 64-bit kernel on my pi with 32-bit userland perfectly fine. The few things that actually need 64-bit (I’m looking at you mongo) run in 64-bit mode via docker. That said, I’m not 100% sure how much memory overhead I have in this setup vs just running the 64-bit userland.<p>Technically there’s a very interesting “hybrid” abi you can try - 32 bit pointers on a 64 bit ISA. The main benefit is the extra registers that get unlocked in 64-bit mode while keeping memory usage lower. It seems there’s an attempt to do this in Debian [1]. From what I read it’s not a big win for arm though but could be big for x86 - since the ISA is very different between x86 and x86_64. Probably doesn’t matter when ram is so cheap nowadays.<p>Separately I’ve now got a serious case of buyers remorse. I just bought the 4gb version last week.

It was 350 Danish kr including delivery.

If you have sevearal lines of logic, you&#x27;d need an auxiliary helper def, and at this point it becomes as unreadable.<p>For Results: I think returning Union[Exception, Value] (where Value is the &#x27;desired&#x27; type) and then using isinstance(result, Exception) is much cleaner.<p>- it can be statically checked with mypy to ensure the same level of type safety as Rust would have<p>- minimal performance impact<p>- no extra wrapping and unwrapping in the code. You can completely ignore mypy and error handling, until you&#x27;re happy, then you harden your program by making sure it complies to mypy.<p>- no extra dependencies, third party code dealing with your library doesn&#x27;t have to deal with your wrappers! If they don&#x27;t check for error type, when Exception is encountered, the program will most likely terminate with AttributeError, which is a desirable behaviour in such situation.<p>- it&#x27;s much easier to compose: propagating error with a decorator is neat, until you have some more sophisticated logic, e.g. for error aggregation<p>- the only downside is that you end up with occasional `if isinstance(result, Exception)...`.<p>I reviewed results library specifically here [0] and elaborate on different error handling techniques in Python, including the approach I described.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;beepb00p.xyz&#x2F;mypy-error-handling.html#container\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;beepb00p.xyz&#x2F;mypy-error-handling.html#container<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-28 19:46:39"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["cheez"],"id":[23343343],"kids":[23345399],"parent":[23336458],"text":["I&#x27;m a big fan of functional programming but this documentation is kind of funny, unintentionally.

There is stoic philosophy passage each day with a modern interpretation by Ryan.<p>Here&#x27;s todays (May 28)<p>May 28th<p>THE FIRST TWO THINGS BEFORE ACTING<p>“The first thing to do — don’t get worked up. For everything happens according to the nature of all things, and in a short time you’ll be nobody and nowhere, even as the great emperors Hadrian and Augustus are now. The next thing to do — consider carefully the task at hand for what it is, while remembering that your purpose is to be a good human being. Get straight to doing what nature requires of you, and speak as you see most just and fitting—with kindness, modesty, and sincerity.” \nM ARCUS A URELIUS, M EDITATIONS , 8.5<p>Imagine, for a second, what Marcus’s life as an emperor must have been like. He would preside over the Senate. He would lead the troops in battle, direct the grand strategy of the army as its highest commander. He would also hear appeals—from citizens, from lawyers, from foreign governments. In other words, like most people in power, he was called on to make decisions: all day, every day, decision after decision.<p>His formula for decision making is a battle-tested method for doing and acting right—literally. Which is why we ought to try to use it ourselves.<p>First, don’t get upset—because that will color your decision negatively and make it harder than it needs to be.<p>Second, remember the purpose and principles you value most. Running potential actions through this filter will eliminate the bad choices and highlight the right ones.<p>Don’t get upset.<p>Do the right thing.<p>That’s it.<p>Holiday, Ryan,Hanselman, Stephen.

A genetic makeup is tuned to an equilibrium in the environment. Just because we can change an organism to better suit human needs, we cannot predict how that mutation will affect the equilibrium. Though genetics says unfit mutations will fail, the directed change of specific metabolic pathways is not like this. The organism is moved from one equilibrium state to another. Rather than the changed organism failing, it may survive and cause failure of other organisms connected to it. Genetic rearrangement is a spontaneous process related to mitosis, meiosis as well as dna repair and gene expression. A specific hazard for example is the accidental  reactivation of proviruses or oncogenes or other more subtle change.

But as the conversation here seems to be mostly about the latter…<\/i>)<p>What a lot of people don&#x27;t realize about LaTeX is that much of its awkwardness comes from it being a product of two very strong personalities (both Turing Award winners for unrelated work!) pulling it in two opposing directions:<p>• Donald Knuth, who designed TeX as a tool for <i>typesetting<\/i> primarily, allowing a meticulous author complete control over the appearance of his pages, and attempting to capture in a program (or at least making possible) the highest standards of typography developed over the centuries since the invention of printing.(†)<p>• Leslie Lamport, who wrote LaTeX as a macro package running in TeX, trying to hide complexity from the author and making things as convenient as possible, out of a (probably correct) belief that authors should <i>not<\/i> care about the appearance and instead only focus on the content! (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lamport.azurewebsites.net&#x2F;pubs&#x2F;document-production.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lamport.azurewebsites.net&#x2F;pubs&#x2F;document-production.p...<\/a>)<p>The result is that with LaTeX, things look “easy” superficially, but everything is implemented in TeX macros (never intended as a full-fledged programming language), so things break in mysterious ways. Not to mention the additional layers of complexity from zillions of users writing their own &quot;packages&quot; for everything. The error messages don&#x27;t make sense to users because they often come from the bowels of TeX, and I suspect that many users even just ignore(!) warnings about overfull&#x2F;underfull boxes.<p>Conversely, if you look at one of Knuth&#x27;s own documents written in plain TeX, everything is startlingly simple: for example there is no automatic equation numbering or cross-references; for Equation 5 you just write &quot;5&quot; in the equation and refer to it as &quot;(5)&quot; later, none of that stuff with &quot;\\eqref{eq:foo}&quot; or whatever. If macros are used, they tend to be custom for the document, rather than elaborate general-purpose ones. Consider giving plain TeX a try (a great book is <i>A Beginner&#x27;s Book of TeX<\/i> by Seroul and Levy); everything makes sense, you feel in power, all the error messages are clear (often the same error messages! but now they apply to something you actually wrote&#x2F;intended), and if nothing else, you&#x27;ll end up with an appreciation of what LaTeX is&#x2F;does.<p>This comment is turning into a repetition of my same tiresome comments on other sites (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cstheory.stackexchange.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;40282\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cstheory.stackexchange.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;40282<\/a>, <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tex.stackexchange.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;398372\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tex.stackexchange.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;398372<\/a>, <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tex.stackexchange.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;386592\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tex.stackexchange.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;386592<\/a>, <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tex.stackexchange.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;384881\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tex.stackexchange.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;384881<\/a>, <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tex.stackexchange.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;518802\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tex.stackexchange.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;518802<\/a> etc.) so I&#x27;ll stop here I guess :-)<p>----<p>(†): good paragraphs, avoiding widows and orphans and hyphenation on consecutive lines and loose&#x2F;tight lines adjacent to each other, all of that.

I imagine the rank-and-file for the most part despise Trump but as a business Twitter (and its shareholders) are more than happy to be the Propaganda Wing of the Republican Party.<p>So I imagine an effort to distance themselves from the outright lies of the commander-in-chief was token resistance to this role, probably aimed at mollifying the collective consciences of the employees.<p>But it&#x27;s doomed and they&#x27;ve fallen into a trap. Here&#x27;s how this is going to go:<p>There is simply no line in the sand you can draw between objective truth and objective lies. What&#x27;s more, even if you can, propagated lies exist because people want to believe them and they see any effort to disabuse them of their provably false views (eg vaccines cause autism) as biased actors trying to hide the &quot;truth&quot;.<p>Human nature can be ugly at times.<p>The take on Section 230 is actually an interesting one and I imagine that&#x27;s going all the way to the Supreme Court if the administration pushes on this. Like you can remove objectionable or illegal content from your platform (in fact you&#x27;re required to by law) and still maintain safe harbor but where does that end? If you&#x27;re Google you don&#x27;t want Youtube filled up with a bunch of racist crap. It&#x27;s bad for your brand. That content may fall under free speech (from a S230 perspective) and if you decide to remove it for the health of the platform and&#x2F;or the value of your brand, does safe harbor still apply?<p>Whatever the case, this administration needs to lose in the next election. Badly. The attack on societal norms and institutitotions is unprecedented and reprehensible and I so would like Trump, McConnell, Ivanka, Jared, Pompeo, Barr and a whole bunch of others to end up in prison after all this is over.<p>This is what scares me the most: in the Watergate era even Republicans found Nixon&#x27;s behaviour beyond the pale. I am utterly convinced that if that happened today there&#x27;d be a strict party-line vote as the President&#x27;s party would happily look the other way.<p>Look no further than the administration&#x27;s so far successful efforts to block Congressional oversight. At no time in history did any administration think it was totally above the law. Make no mistake: that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re doing. Worse, no administration so blatantly engaging in obstruction would&#x27;ve continued to have ~40% of the population support it no matter what. Thanks to decades of gerrymandering in state Houses and voter suppression that 40% almost controls the election by itself as higher-population states are essentially disenfranchises in the modern electoral system.<p>For the record, I&#x27;m against the popular vote deciding the presidential election but that&#x27;s a whole other topic.<p>How anyone who can call themselves &quot;Christian&quot; and support this president and his policies is utterly beyond me."],"time":["2020-05-28 11:41:54"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["tasogare"],"id":[23335121],"kids":[23335176,23335206,23335269],"parent":[23334830],"text":["Very good.
