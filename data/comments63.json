As secret projects go, the Prime team was brought in very late and given a very short integration window (2-ish weeks, maybe) to determine if that feature would make the cut for launch.<p>Part of the user experience was getting a &quot;personalized&quot; letter delivered through the Kindle delivery mechanism that included the Prime logo and JeffB&#x27;s signature. This letter was effectively a Mobi ebook dynamically generated before being pushed to the device. This functionality previously existed and was how notes indicating that lent items had expired were generated, however, those were plaintext and used a custom templating system that the Kindle team (justifiably) didn&#x27;t want to expose to external teams. The Kindle team wanted us to generate a Mobi that they would pass along, which would have required a bunch of new infrastructure and technology we had no experience with. A former teammate who was now in Kindle made the case for us continuing to use the extensive HTML custom messaging infrastructure we had, but the Kindle team&#x27;s capability limited them to hitting a single endpoint and we didn&#x27;t have a nice way to bundle all of our resources (images, content, etc.) into a single file (e.g. zip, tarball). On a call one afternoon I suggested adding data URL support so we could continue to leverage our infrastructure, they could continue to leverage their&#x27;s and only this small tool they shelled out to would need to change.<p>Of course, the kindlegen team was not involved in the discussion initially, their code did not use the tools the rest of the company used, for whatever reason they were unwilling to accept code contributions, and they wanted several months to implement the feature.<p>Being young and without kids at the time, I went home, knocked out a wrapper that would convert data URLs to external resources and replace the references, and then call out to kindlegen to generate the mobi, and had a working tool the next morning. The whole thing went (almost¹) flawlessly, allowed Prime to test and debug with the tools they knew, allowed the Kindle distribution team to swap out one piece transparently, and the Fire launched with that implementation in place. And like most stop-gap solutions, it was in place for several years before kindlegen finally supported data URLs natively.<p>This was all running on Linux hosts, and that was many many years ago now. It&#x27;s a good reminder that code is like a sandcastle. It will be gone tomorrow, but the tide will continue.<p>¹ sure, there may have been a small bug or two, but I stabilized a bunch of their tests in the process, so I consider it a win."],"time":["2020-08-25 22:30:54"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ggm"],"id":[24278149],"kids":[24279400],"parent":[24275231],"text":["I feel strongly that Amazon can sell kindles and we&#x27;re ok, and amazon can sell content and we&#x27;re ok but having amazon able to sell both kindle and content, and direct IPR outcomes across the platform and the content, is actually pretty bad.<p>This is not a real substitutable space.

The hole apparently allows for two different properties: stiffness above it and flexibility below. According to Bauer, this produces a slingshot effect -- almost like a smaller version of the stick’s shaft (which, as explained in this video, bends almost unbelievably to whip the puck forward). These days, ‘twigs’ are made of carbon fiber, though as the hockey lingo suggests, wood used to be the material of choice. The evolution of the hockey stick from wood to carbon fiber gives us insight into a material property called resilience.\n&gt;Resilience is basically the opposite of damping. High resilience materials bounce back with most of the energy that you put into them. As Stevel Vogel illustrates in Cats’ Paws and Catapults, spider silk is a great example of low resilience material. “A web of high resilience would, like a trampoline, tend to fling the prey back out.” Vogel goes on to note that “resilience management highlights the dichotomy between nature and human technologies.” Natural materials, like wood, tend to have lower resilience whereas man-made materials, like carbon fiber, tend to have higher resilience.\n&gt;You can see why carbon fiber, with its higher resilience, has overtaken wood as material du jour; more of the energy you put into the stick comes out on the puck for a faster shot. But a stick can be too resilient&#x2F;springy -- when receiving a pass, you don’t want the puck to bounce off the stick away from you. Players call it “feel”. Some damping is beneficial, as shown in this slo-mo video of a stick that combats springiness with a urethane insert. These hole-y sticks try to solve the problem a different way, adding a softer spring into the mix with the aim of providing “feel” without taking away energy from the shot. So, is it worth buying the latest in hockey tech - a stick with a hole in it for $450? If you’re a beer leaguer like me, clapping your usual head-hunting bombs twenty feet wide of the net, probably not."],"time":["2020-08-25 21:38:59"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["pugworthy"],"id":[24276478],"kids":[24277216],"parent":[24275159],"text":["I got a strong &quot;Nimbus 5000&quot; vibe reading this.

But in fact low yield rates were the reason Intel famously had to delay its 7nm processes. The fact that defect rates have been kept roughly constant seems to suggest they can go even further into 3nm processes, but this is the problem with extrapolating from graphs with too little data - at 3nm they&#x27;d run into very challenging physical limits and it&#x27;s not clear we&#x27;ll ever get a 3nm chip.<p>It is amazing to me that we can achieve such low defect rates on projects so complicated as highly brain-insecure sticks of meat that evolved to hunt and forage.

You actually were able to distribute Flash content like a normal web application, broken up into multiple SWFs, images, and so on. The vast majority of Flash content was a single file, because it&#x27;s easier to distribute that way.<p>With WebBundles, if you want to deny specific subresources, you can still have the browser block them by identifier or hash, which is the same as you can do with a regular web request.

For example, something like:<p><pre><code>    bundle:&#x2F;&#x2F;[optional hash, origin, or regex?]![uri or regex]\n    &#x2F;&#x2F; e.g.\n    bundle:&#x2F;&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;site.example&#x2F;!https:&#x2F;&#x2F;site.example&#x2F;regulated-sub-bundle-file.html<\/code><\/pre>"],"time":["2020-08-25 23:41:38"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["sloshnmosh"],"id":[24276126],"kids":[24277201],"parent":[24274968],"text":["Until the entire advertising community gets their s<i><\/i>t together I will block every ad and script that I can.<p>It has gotten to where there the line between advertising and malware is blurred or nonexistent.<p>It seems to me that every  new API or web standard that Google creates is an attempt to stop ad blockers disguised as meaningful useful features."],"time":["2020-08-25 23:08:35"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jakelazaroff"],"id":[24276014],"kids":{},"parent":[24274968],"text":["Yet another case study in why allowing a privacy-hostile advertising company to control the most popular web browser and influence web standards is bad for the web."],"time":["2020-08-25 22:57:03"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["devit"],"id":[24277058],"kids":{},"parent":[24274968],"text":["Seems completely baseless.<p>There is no difference between an URL without web bundles, and an URL that refers to a &quot;web bundle&quot; and a path within in.<p>All the things that they claim can be done with Web Bundles can be done without just as easily by putting all dependent resources in a versioned subdirectory."],"time":["2020-08-26 00:35:13"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["philips"],"id":[24276108],"kids":[24277714],"parent":[24274968],"text":["&gt; So-called &quot;Binary Transparency&quot; may eventually allow users to verify that a program they&#x27;ve been delivered is one that&#x27;s available to the public, and not a specially-built version intended to attack just them.

I&#x27;d never really looked into it recently, as I&#x27;d never done anything that needed a cross origin request.<p>But recently I wanted to make a little web page that could control my Denon A&#x2F;V receiver. The receiver has two or three different network APIs. There&#x27;s one that uses telnet, and a couple of different HTTP ones.<p>You can point a browser at the receiver, and it gives you a page for controlling the receiver using one of the HTTP APIs. The API is reasonably fast, but the control page itself is glacial. A bit of poking around in the browser looking at requests and responses in the network monitor in the developer tools told me how to use that API.<p>The other HTTP API is used by the Denon mobile app. A bit of packet sniffing while using the mobile app told me how to use that API. Like the other HTTP API, that one is fast. The mobile app is also responsive, once it launches, but sometimes it takes a fair bit of time to find the receiver.<p>What I wanted was a simple web page, that I could stick on my website on Amazon Lightsail, which would just tell me the current source and volume, have buttons to switch between sources, and buttons for setting the volume. The page would use JavaScript to talk to the Denon.<p>Well, this was fine for changing inputs and volume, because those were simple GET requests. The Denon&#x27;s web server doesn&#x27;t implement CORS at all, so the responses lack any CORS headers, and the browser rejects them...but by that time the actual desired action has taken place on the server so I can just ignore the error.<p>For source and volume, that doesn&#x27;t work because I need to get the returned data.<p>I flailed around for a while trying to find a way around this. Finally I ended up giving up on the original place of having my page on my outside website. Instead I stuck it on an RPi that is in my living room controlling a space heater and doing temperature monitoring, and put some server side code on the RPi to control the Denon. The page then invokes that code on the RPi to do the actual commands to the Denon. The web page is only interacting with the RPi, so no CORS worries.<p>I probably got a bad impression of CORS from all this, but I can&#x27;t figure out what it actually helps. Lets say we have a site that came from site S, running on the browser  of user U, and from there is trying to do a cross-origin request to site C.<p>It&#x27;s not protecting C from anything I can see, because any restrictions C specifies in the CORS response headers depend on U honoring them to do anything. Someone trying to do something malicious with C could just ignore them.<p>It&#x27;s not protecting U from scripts sending out personal information to C, because CORS doesn&#x27;t block <i>sending<\/i> information if you do your sending in a way to not trigger the preflight check, which is easy to do. It just blocks your browser from doing anything with the response.<p>If a bad guy is able to get scripts to run U&#x27;s browser for a site from S, it does block those scripts from getting data from C (unless C says it is OK). But if the bad guy really needs their script to get data from C, they could just go through an intermediate server they control that relays data from C. They control the CORS headers on their server, and can strip the CORS headers that come from C.<p>What am I missing?<p>PS: the Denon control page came out nice, I think [1] (well, except the centering of the &quot;Recheck status&quot; button looks off a bit...never noticed that before). It&#x27;s all flexbox layout that resizes reasonable, so it is quite usable on my iPhone, iPad, Surface Pro 4, and iMac.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;3tIhXUE\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;3tIhXUE<\/a>"],"time":["2020-08-25 19:53:16"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["minhoryang"],"id":[24273254],"kids":{},"parent":[24269609],"text":["Awesome work!

People then too thought that &#x2F;etc&#x2F;rc was for the operating system manufacturer, and &#x2F;etc&#x2F;rc.local was for the system administrator.

Unfortunately I don&#x27;t see much of a solution offered in the statement.<p>The biggest obstacle is not only eas of use. Companies as FB, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google etc solve also other problems, they also select and filter information for you. They don&#x27;t do it flawlessly, but still do quit a good job. One so far nobody else offers, because they are first movers in the space and now own the biggest networks.<p>Unfortunately their big centralized systems also creates the danger that comes with any big centralized source of information. There are always people that want it to put to good use for noble goals. And as it the human condition all power corrupts.<p>So in my  opinion it is never good to concentrate too much power in the hands of too few people. It does not really matter if it is big government or big business. It will always start working for conformity and limit free speech.<p>We already see this totalitarian nature in the censorship around Covid information. It started as a way to surpress legitimate misinformation. But it is now actually preventing and surpressing new research that challanges current medical dogmas. Big tech, is like big government. It just does not work that well, is risk averse and is favouring stability over inovation.<p>The question then is, how can we revitalize the old decentralized web ideal, with all it&#x27;s free information published  for all individuals? The old web only solved standardization of content with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It did not solve relationships and privacy between people.<p>Now has the time come to work on standards that connect people. To build networks of friends and to build trust networks like all social media now already does.<p>Technology is also still improving. While all people can&#x27;t type more stories, they only have each aimited amount of time for doing that, computers keep getting faster and faster, storage is keep getting cheaper and cheaper. So computer power is becoming a commodity with less and less value. Every day, it gets easier and cheaper to host data and search it.<p>Web space is cheap, so take Twitter, is it really that hard to publish a Twitter feed in a JSON file, use encryption to allow friends access to your feed data and publish that all on your own rented space that you fully control? Is it that hard to rank your own friends tweets in your own feed that runs on your rented computer power?<p>Advertisment as financing the computer rent is an option as well. Third parties can build services on top of the standardized data sets. Except that they can not lock you in, as it is your data. They just unlock it by providing search and filtering services while also include ads to make some bucks.<p>This open technology could also benefit existing alternative social networks, because it creates the needed network effect they need. Because by letting smaller parties work together without even knowing or agreeing with each other. Nobody controlls the network as everybody owns his own dataset. But can still connect to all other people who use the same data standard.<p>What is keeping us from building something like this?

Then we started working on the problem and realised we couldn’t possibly raise enough money to do so, then we did a crowdfunding campaign that never included the phone (we promised the alpha of an initial peer-to-peer Mac-based social networking client and promised to keep working on the problem, both of which we delivered on). Also, anyone who asked for a refund from the crowdfunding for any reason got one. If I could do it again, we wouldn’t have held the crowdfunding and I wouldn’t have started on Mac. But this was all part of the process of us learning about the problem.\n\n  - It wasn’t on Kick Starter, we built our own crowdfunding system because I wasn’t happy with how Kick Starter, etc., were gathering data (we didn’t want your privacy violated for trying to support us)\n\n  - Since then, I’ve sold the three family homes we had (apartments in Turkey, total worth about ~€200,000 or so) and we’ve kept working on the same problem for the past six&#x2F;seven years with the the initial crowdfunding + those funds + sales of our tracker blocker (Better Blocker) on Mac&#x2F;iOS + professional speaking fees when we speak at conferences, etc. + donations to our not-for-profit (which basically pay our hosting fees every month).\n\n  - Unless IndieWeb is suddenly about building single-tenant web nodes as part of a peer-to-peer future &#x2F; topologically decentralised Web for everyday people, I don’t see how it’s the same as Small Web. If that is what they’re about now, then sure but, last I checked, they thought we were deranged zealots for publicly calling out Google, Facebook, etc., for being surveillance capitalists. \n\n  - Re: not having done anything since: we created Better Blocker, I personally spoke at over 50 events to raise awareness of the issue, including three times at the European Parliament, I spearheaded the creation of progressive tech policy at one of Europe’s most progressive political movements, and we worked with the City of Ghent on evolving what is now Site.js and the Small Web initiative.\n\n  - Finally, someone mentioned that some “privacy projects” say “Don&#x27;t trust others, trust us.” If anyone tells you that, don’t trust them. We know how to, can, should be (and are) building technology where you don’t have to trust us.\n<\/code><\/pre>\nAlso, PS:<p>Small Web is not about having your own Static Web page or having yet another tool for geeks. It’s not about going back to the 90s (been there, was fun, wouldn’t want to go back), it’s about taking the best of that ethos and implementing it for 2020 and beyond. Right now, I’m trying to build a tool for developers (including us) so that we can use it to build everything things for everyday people that don’t require a Faustian pact to give up your privacy, freedom of speech, or your personhood to use.<p>Whether or not this “succeeds”, who knows? But we’re sharing everything we make under AGPL and trying to share every brick in this bridge we’re trying to build between where we are (the sewer that is surveillance capitalism) and where we want to be in hopes that if the stuff we build doesn’t work, at least others can use the tools to build other solutions.<p>Here’s a recent talk if you’d like to learn more about what we’re working on:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;small-tech.org&#x2F;videos&#x2F;eastern-partnership-civil-society-online-hackathon-2020&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;small-tech.org&#x2F;videos&#x2F;eastern-partnership-civil-soci...<\/a><p>You don’t have to like what we do and you definitely don’t have to like me but I do hope that you will consider the ideas (and ideals) we’re working towards."],"time":["2020-08-25 12:24:54"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["renewiltord"],"id":[24275127],"kids":[24275193,24275182,24275827],"parent":[24273851],"text":["He genuinely seems like a guy who was just trying to help.

For example, the eigensystem of its adjacency matrix provides powerful understanding of a graph — but how much accuracy do you need in order to trust that understanding? If you need arbitrary precision because of the pathological features of a particular family of graph (expander graphs, say), and the scaling of the needed precision links directly to aspects of that graph pathology, this is really telling you that the eigenvector computation is not the most natural “computation basis” to approach this phenomenon — and some explicitly discrete algorithm would make this latent complexity relationship manifest. Probably individual instances of this kind of phenomena are well known to those who study the relevant structures, but I’m not sure if the general phenomena is described or modeled anywhere.<p>In some weird sense you can link this to a kind of “computational curvature” — ala some of Wolfram’s metamathematical musings. If one’s prior is to distrust continuous mathematics and see only discrete computational processes as “real”, it’s exactly the kind of phenomena one will be on the lookout for. Anyway, the curvature analogy is that as you attempt to maintain a particular computational basis for computing a phenomena of interest as its complexity scales, other typically-uncorrelated complexity requirements that are normally treated as constants will explode.

Still, if we choose to look, it&#x27;s in our face every hour of every day, in our news feeds, our Twitter streams, our Facebook statuses.<p>(Compare also: the quality of social networks whereby for almost everyone, your friends will have more friends than you [1]; the Matthew Effect, whereby small changes in initial endowment of power&#x2F;fame&#x2F;success can compound [2]; and how viewing top athletes can actually decrease someone&#x27;s coordination in following challenges [3].)<p>In the plant and insect world, sometimes as one organism thrives, it sends off chemical signals that suppress the growth of its siblings&#x2F;peers&#x2F;neighbors, in an effect called allelopathy.<p>Information about others&#x27; great works and successes, transmitted by the net, may sometimes serve as a sort of memetic negative allelopathy. The message is: this territory is taken; you can&#x27;t reach the sunshine here; try another place&#x2F;strategy (or even just wither so your distant relatives can thrive). This can be be the subtext even if that&#x27;s not the conscious intent of those relaying the information. Indeed, the reports may be intended as motivational, and sometimes be, while at other times being discouraging.<p>What to do? Not yet certain, but awareness that this mechanism is in play may help. You can recognize that what you&#x27;re reading is not representative, and that comparing yourself against prominent outliers -- or even worse, vague composites of outliers who are each the best in one dimension -- is unrealistic and mentally unhealthy.<p>Actual progress for yourself may require detaching from the firehose a bit, picking a narrower focus. (HN&#x27;s eclectic topic matter can be inherently defocusing.)<p>And remind yourself that despite various reptilian-hindbrain impulses, most interesting creative activity today is far from zero-sum. The outliers can win, and you can win too (even if you don&#x27;t achieve outlier-sized success). Their success can expand your options, and they may wind up being your collaborators (formally or informally by simply participating in a mutual superstructure) moreso than your &#x27;competitors&#x27;.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.psychologytoday.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;blog&#x2F;the-scientific-fundamentalist&#x2F;200911&#x2F;why-your-friends-have-more-friends-you-do\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.psychologytoday.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;blog&#x2F;the-scientific-funda...<\/a><p>[2] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Matthew_effect\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Matthew_effect<\/a><p>[3] Can&#x27;t find the reference at the moment, but the study I recall showed people video of a top soccer player, and subsequently they performed worse on tasks requiring physical coordination.<\/i>"],"time":["2020-08-24 23:06:06"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["m1117"],"id":[24264740],"kids":{},"parent":[24261826],"text":["I&#x27;m extraordinarily good at procrastinating!"],"time":["2020-08-24 21:52:26"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["weregiraffe"],"id":[24268432],"kids":{},"parent":[24261826],"text":["Buy can you be extraordinary with not being OK?"],"time":["2020-08-25 07:50:11"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["S_A_P"],"id":[24271511],"kids":{},"parent":[24261826],"text":["I read the title as &quot;Boeing ok with not being extraordinary&quot;.

We agree more on sharing things in common than we ever have. There are still outliers like the plans coming out of Apple and Microsoft we hear about in the news, where they&#x27;ve sought to pivot PCs towards ARM.<p>[...]<p>&gt;If a microprocessor architecture consensus finally exists, then I believe we should be focusing on building better tools that help software developers benefit from it<p>Considering ARM an outlier in a world were smartphones outnumber desktop PCs and where the x86 stronghold is under attack from several sides seems like a strange take to me.<p>Also, there&#x27;s more to portability than managing to run a hello world from the same binary on Windows and Linux. I used to use FreeBSD a lot on the desktop, which usually involved using Linux binary compatibility to run Linux closed source binaries that weren&#x27;t available on FreeBSD. It worked generally pretty well, but it wasn&#x27;t without friction at times even though it was coded by very smart people and between two systems that were overall very similar.<p>These &quot;compatibility&quot; applications often end up as 2nd class citizen that don&#x27;t integrate well with native applications, or at least not as easily. See Wine for instance, managing to run Windows applications on un*x is a huge undertaking.<p>&gt;One of the reasons why I love working with a lot of these old unsexy technologies, is that I want any software work I&#x27;m involved in to stand the test of time with minimal toil. Similar to how the Super Mario Bros ROM has managed to survive all these years without needing a GitHub issue tracker.<p>I love emulation, so I definitely understand where this is coming from, but I don&#x27;t really see what that has to do with the rest. In particular if you&#x27;re willing to go down the emulation route, why do you care about everybody running x86? Super Mario Bros was not written to run on a Celeron.

As an example, one of the images tries to highlight Asana&#x27;s timeline and their achievements [1]. One of the things they mention is opening an international office with ~100 employees and &lt;11k customers. Based on their current figures of 75,000 paying customers and revenue of $142,606,000, you would expect a revenue of ~$19 million for 11k customers. Why is a company with 100 employees &amp; &lt;$19 million in revenue opening international offices? Likewise, why is the company spending 74% of revenue on sales and 63% on R&amp;D? How are they managing to lose 83% of revenue? It seems like the company has 0 responsibility with how they spend their cash and beyond that, it&#x27;s unclear whether they even have a path towards profitability if they&#x27;re spending 75 cents on the dollar just to make a sale and throwing almost $100 million at R&amp;D every year. Despite substantial revenue growth y&#x2F;y (~70%), they&#x27;ve managed to outpace it by growing losses twice as fast at ~140%.

I&#x27;m a full-time React developer, and the difference in engineering culture and best engineering practices between Unity and React is massive. The Unity experience is riddled with bugs, poorly-thought-out workflows, and half-finished or obsolete features. Simple tasks, more often than not, become an exercise in frustration. I&#x27;ve written a blog post about this[1], though it&#x27;s incomplete (mostly because somewhere after writing the 2000th word I wondered why I was even using Unity at all) so I&#x27;ve never published it anywhere.<p>I&#x27;ve honestly wondered a lot why Unity is successful at all, and the only answer I can really come to is that their direct competition - Unreal Engine, and a few other studio-made engines like CryEngine - are even worse. (Which leads to another question: why is it so hard to make a good game engine? But that would be another thousand words, so let&#x27;s not stray too far from the point...) Godot is a glimmer on the horizon, but it looks like it still needs a few years to catch up.<p>I also have a sneaking suspicion that Unity is successful because it is used by a lot of people as their introduction into programming, and they simply don&#x27;t know that anything better is possible.<p>Still, I suspect that most developers who use Unity will eventually reach the same conclusion and move on, and this seems to be confirmed by the google trends graph, which has been sloping steadily downwards over the last 5 years or so[2].<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.notion.so&#x2F;UnityIsFundamentallyBroken-e3b1474e7afb42bdb05cadcd3c2dbd77\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.notion.so&#x2F;UnityIsFundamentallyBroken-e3b1474e7af...<\/a><p>[2]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;trends.google.com&#x2F;trends&#x2F;explore?date=all&amp;geo=US&amp;q=%2Fm%2F0dmyvh\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;trends.google.com&#x2F;trends&#x2F;explore?date=all&amp;geo=US&amp;q=%...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-08-24 18:04:21"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ordinaryradical"],"id":[24261756],"kids":[24262061],"parent":[24261559],"text":["Having followed this space for some time, Unity made huge strides at the beginning but has become notorious for punishing shiny features while leaving things broken or half-supported, which makes the developer’s life hard if you happen to run into one of those bugs.

This allows an analysis to be verified after the fact, which increases trust and helps figure out what happened when contradictions appear between experiments.  However, if the original work involved physical experimentation or any non-automated steps (as is the case for most science) the ability to run the original code provides only partial replication.  Overall the ability to re-run old code is a fairly low priority.<p>From the perspective of someone who primarily uses computers as a tool to facilitate research, the priority list is closer to:<p>1. Retain documentation of what was <i>meant<\/i> to happen. Objectives, experimental design, experimental &amp; analysis protocols, relevant background, etc.<p>2. Retain documentation of what actually happened, usually in terms of noting deviations from the protocol.  This is the purpose of a lab notebook.  Pen &amp; paper excels here.<p>3. Retain raw data files.<p>4. Retain files produced in the course of analysis.<p>5. Retain custom source code.<p>6. Version control all the above.<p>7. Make everything run in the correct order with one command (i.e, full automation).<p>Only once all the above is achieved would it be worth ensuring that the software used in the analysis can be re-run in 10 years.  Solving the &quot;packaging problem&quot; in a typical scientific context (multiple languages, multiple OSes, commercial software, mostly short scripts) is complex.  When the outcome of an analysis is suspect, the easiest and most robust approach is to check the analysis by redoing it from scratch.  This takes less time than trying to ensure every analysis will run on demand even as the computing ecosystem changes out from under it.<p>Most of the time spent writing analysis code is deciding <i>what<\/i> the code should do, not actually writing the code.

Great guy and glad to see he picked up command but disagree with him on the benefits of BFM and the true value of manned fighter jets over the coming decades.  The US military is caught between two wars.  One, against opponents who can’t really hit back where fighter jets are overkill.  Better off with AC-130s and the like.  The other against opponents who can hit back, where the battle will be won or lost in space, cyber, economically, and possibly through nuclear warfare.  Even with regards to fighters, the amount of money spent on BFM is really a boondoggle.  It’s like spending billions training the infantry to knife fight.  It’s not Vietnam and the last gunfighter with regards to missiles and targeting.  Is not the AIM-9X targeting AI itself?<p>A great book that rings more true than ever talks about the obsolescence of weapons systems. I believe it was Freedman[1]  A key thesis is that as a predominant weapon system becomes more vulnerable, it becomes more expensive, as it’s burdened with more defensive measures to survive from cheaper more expendable systems.  In World War 2 the canonical example was the battle ship and the aircraft.  Now it’s the fighter jet and the missile (or drone) etc. Just look at the ridiculous state of the JSF.<p>Manned missile trucks are valuable for countering electronic attack, but not dogfighting. Still, practice dogfighting is one of the most fun things you can do, too bad it hasn’t really been applicable since Vietnam.

Computer systems are already a big part of the aircraft, in the near term this could result in some pretty wicked copilot software."],"time":["2020-08-25 04:01:13"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["moneytide1"],"id":[24266387],"kids":[24266681,24266430,24266809,24266637],"parent":[24265513],"text":["I&#x27;m assuming combat aircraft are capable of delivering more G&#x27;s than a human body can handle, though pilots train to sustain brief bouts of high G for quick maneuvering - is this limit factored into to the &quot;AI player&quot; handling?

If you want to keep the perfect data link between the simulator&#x27;s outputs and the AI player computer, then at least let the human play by watching the (God&#x27;s eye) display with the aircraft sprites sporting those kill-point spears and ditch the HUD.  The objective would simply be to touch the enemy aircraft with that spear.<p>The HUD is cool and all.  But how do I know where the enemy is if it is outside of the HUD&#x27;s field?
