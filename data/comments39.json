The idea is that, instead of writing a PostgreSQL extension in C (which is the only option for interesting extensions), you can also write one in pure rust.<p>I&#x27;ve eagerly awaited many features to make this work reasonably well, and I&#x27;ve been very pleased how much rust has helped my use case over the last few years.<p>Although lots of languages have a C FFI, that&#x27;s really not enough to extend a complex codebase. Postgres has it&#x27;s own setjmp&#x2F;longjmp-based error handling, it&#x27;s own system of allocators, it needs a way to find the right functions in an extension and call them the right way, its own way of dealing with signals, etc. There are zillions of internal structs, and the extension needs to be able to read&#x2F;modify them without copying&#x2F;translation. Oh, and also, postgres doesn&#x27;t like threads at all, so the extension better not make any (at least not ones that call back into postgres APIs).<p>The only language even close to getting all of this right is rust:<p>* it has no runtime that causes problems with threading, scheduling, signal handling, or garbage collection<p>* typically GC&#x27;d languages can&#x27;t operate very well on unmodified C structs; rust doesn&#x27;t have a GC so it can<p>* rust goes out of its way to support C-compatible structs without any copying&#x2F;translation, and can even treat some plain C representations as more interesting types in a binary-compatible way (like a nullable pointer in C could be treated as an Option&lt;&amp;MyStruct&gt; in rust)<p>* the tokio library allows nice concurrency without creating threads if you use the CurrentThread runtime<p>* it supports changing the global allocator to be the postgres allocator<p>* rust has good procedural macro support, which is important because a lot of postgres APIs heavily use macros, so making the rust version ergonomic requires similar macro magic<p>Areas rust could be more helpful, but which I&#x27;m trying to address on my own to the extent that I can:<p>* Support for setjmp&#x2F;longjmp. I know this is not easy, but important for interacting with C code that already uses it. I realize it would be unsafe, and that it can&#x27;t be wrapped up in a safe way directly, and it would be delicate to create safe APIs that use it at all. But I still want it. I made a crate[2] that adds support, but it has a few issues that can&#x27;t be resolved without compiler support.<p>* Better support for cdylib shared libraries that might call back into the host program that loads the library. Right now, you have to pass platform-specific flags to get it to link without complaining about undefined symbols (because they won&#x27;t be resolve until the library is loaded into the host program). Also, it&#x27;s difficult to test the shared library, because you have to guess at the location of the built library to be able to tell the host program where to find it before you can begin your test. I made a crate[3] to help with these things also, but it would be nice to have better support.<p>Oh, and one more thing on my wishlist not directly related to this project is that it would be nice to have support for datastructure-specific allocators (like a mini-allocator just for a hash table). Then, you&#x27;d be able to monitor and control memory usage by inspecting that allocator; and when you destroy or reset the hash table, you can know that the memory is freed&#x2F;cleared as well (without worrying about fragmentation). Maybe these mini-allocators could also be used in other contexts, too, but it would probably be easiest to get the lifetimes to work out if it was tied to a data structure.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jeff-davis&#x2F;postgres-extension.rs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jeff-davis&#x2F;postgres-extension.rs<\/a>\n[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jeff-davis&#x2F;setjmp.rs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jeff-davis&#x2F;setjmp.rs<\/a>\n[3] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jeff-davis&#x2F;cdylib-plugin.rs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jeff-davis&#x2F;cdylib-plugin.rs<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-15 18:39:01"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["joshlk"],"id":[23191209],"kids":[23191409,23191390,23191225],"parent":[23190885],"text":["Is there a roadmap for the next 1&#x2F;2&#x2F;5 years?"],"time":["2020-05-15 14:12:41"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["pot8n"],"id":[23194383],"kids":{},"parent":[23190885],"text":["Despite Rust is way cleanly built, superior in almost every aspect than Go can ever dream to be, I doubt it will really take off really in the cloud business until there is:<p>1. official gRPC support<p>2. official Kubernetes API client support<p>3. official cloud vendor SDK support (AWS, GCP, Azure, etc...)<p>4.

I was hooked on my first reading and would go on to read it several more times before I entered my teens. It was tied with Tenney L.

During the summer breaks from Georgia Tech, Al Montgomery and I built an organic synthesis lab in an old chicken house on the edge of town where we made research chemicals to sell. Most of them were noxious or either explosive. No one else wanted to make them, somebody wanted them, and so their production became our domain. We suffered no boredom and no boss. We made enough money to buy new equipment. Max Gergel, who ran Columbia Organic Chemicals Company, and who was an unusually nice man, encouraged us and bought most of our products, which he resold. There were no government regulators to stifle our fledgling efforts, and it was a golden age, but we didn&#x27;t notice it. We learned a lot of organic chemistry.&quot;<p>The chicken coop lab full of noxious chemicals isn&#x27;t far removed from how Max Gergel got his start in the chemistry business either.<p>In this humorous, anecdotal chronicle of Max&#x27;s life from high school mad scientist to successful operator of a chemical supply business, you&#x27;ll learn where metallic potassium should NOT be stored, how to prepare perfectly alcohol-free n-dodecyl bromide, and why one man would be crazy enough to want a preparative scale procedure for methyl isocyanide. You&#x27;ll also learn, humorously but quite clearly, how the golden age of &quot;no government regulators&quot; contained the seeds of its own destruction, as horrendous odors, accidental poisonings, dumpings, fires, and miscellaneous accidents and occupational hazards take their toll on Gergel and his employees, neighbors, and surrounding environs.<p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.sciencemadness.org&#x2F;library&#x2F;books&#x2F;gergel_isopropyl_bromide.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.sciencemadness.org&#x2F;library&#x2F;books&#x2F;gergel_isopr...<\/a><p><i>The Scientific Method: A Personal Account of Unusual Projects in War and in Peace<\/i><p>Famed Harvard chemistry professor Louis Fieser&#x27;s personal history of development of incendiary weapons during WW II, including the infamous Bat Bomb, plus development of cortisone, antimalarial drugs, and educational material for students.<p>Louis Fieser joined the American war effort before America had even officially entered World War II, as one of 20 professor invited to the house of Roger Adams in October 1940 to join the National Defense Research Committee. He was instructed early on to work on chemical vesicants but, considering them inhumane, quickly made a lateral move to begin development of gelled gasoline incendiary weapons. He led the research effort behind napalm, several other components of large-scale incendiary ordnance, and smaller special purpose incendiary devices for use by spies and saboteurs.<p>Fieser&#x27;s strangest project was development of the Bat Bomb: a cluster-bomb arrangement of hibernating bats carrying time-delayed incendiaries. As the bats fell from bombers over enemy cities, they would rouse from hibernation mid-air and seek shelter in attics of the city below. Their incendiaries would then start concealed, hard-to-fight fires. The project was surprisingly successful for one never deployed, and included the own-goal immolation of an administrative building during testing.<p>When Fieser was not working on setting fires he also had time to begin work on the first edition of his organic chemistry textbook, research cortisone chemistry, and work on antimalarial drugs. The information given late in the book about getting cats to pose for photographs with chemical apparatus is invaluable because it comes from real experience.<p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.sciencemadness.org&#x2F;library&#x2F;books&#x2F;the_scientific_method.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.sciencemadness.org&#x2F;library&#x2F;books&#x2F;the_scientif...<\/a><p>[1] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.sciencemadness.org&#x2F;library&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.sciencemadness.org&#x2F;library&#x2F;<\/a><p>[2]"],"time":["2020-05-15 18:41:09"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ChrisMarshallNY"],"id":[23193943],"kids":{},"parent":[23192651],"text":["Awesome book!

Basically we share screens (on Zoom) while talking about whatever is going on at work. It&#x27;s sorta of a &quot;open-space&quot; equivalent but online and with a mute button.<p>Comm-work is more about showing than telling. A screen is always shared (or a whiteboard). We share emails on screen and sometimes write them together, we hear in into a customer call (like through Teams whilst we remain connected through Zoom), or we just tune out into our thing. It&#x27;s an impromptu that can last anywhere from 20 to 90 minutes.<p>It&#x27;s not scheduled, it&#x27;s not a standup, you don&#x27;t have to report status (yuck!) or say anything. Just keep working if you feel like it. You can mute yourself or others. Most of our teammates (not all teams are the same) feel like sharing something, be it a milestone, a cool widget they found or a piece of code they feel are blocking. This works great because it just naturally surfaces issues <i>before<\/i> they are issues.<p>The bad part, if anything, is that it is run by a manager who knows how to improvise, when to call one up (and call it off if someone has to take their kid to the doctor) or how to dig into the team&#x27;s mind and create the meeting narrative. It also requires some degree of direct speak (&quot;Hey you, whats up with that task?&quot;) which also does not work with every ego around. So this is not something that I think can be taught at seminars as it&#x27;s not very scientific. It&#x27;s just natural and basically arises whenever a chat room becomes to chatty. I personally believe comm-work is deeply more effective than any agile standup or kanban, which never ever worked for us. Being such an improv keeps people on their feet. They never know when the team is going to meet, what the next customer email will say. Your code editor becomes not so much of a secret place.

But from my angle, a normal Chinese guy working in the field of material research in China for a decade and deep inside the system, my points would be:<p>1. you guys really worry too much about our ability to innovate, seriously. There is no room for real innovations. But at the same time the system rewards stealing and copying. The system, the education, the overall political environment are not designed with innovations in mind but to help a few to stay in power. My personal take on this is that Chinese &quot;innovation&quot; is now built upon: Chinese with foreign education&#x2F;working background bringing back technologies, CCP buying foreign companies with OUR everyday people&#x27;s money, and of course hacking&#x2F;stealing directly. I don&#x27;t believe we have a change winning the innovation war, not in the long run.<p>2. for a &quot;private&quot; company like huawei, isn&#x27;t it weird that it&#x27;s always backed by CCP? Lots of Chinese private companies get balls kicked everyday and why only huawei get treatment worthy of a state owned business? Even us Chinese knows better.<p>3. please think about us everyday Chinese citizens. we are currently under direct information warfare and systematic repression waged by CCP for decades, and our lives&#x2F;future squeezed out in order to found companies like huawei and projects like one belt one road, without a f<i><\/i>king vote. It&#x27;s much bigger than us vs huawei, at least from our side.<p>btw it is not my field of expertise but I&#x27;d like to call for experienced software&#x2F;hardware engineers from the west, help us bring down the CCP&#x27;s GFW system before it&#x27;s too late.

I thought it was more accurate to say it was a continuum, and using two different techniques was a sign that we still had not figured it out. After all, a blog post about programming might have an interactive example. An article about retirement might embed a calculator. If you try to categorize a site or even just a page as Document or Application, it gets fuzzy. But if you look at a page and just try to categorize it section by section, as Document or Application, it&#x27;s easier. (Hence, Web Components make more sense to me.)<p>So anyway, most people spend some time surfing the web --- by that I mean visiting Documents. Clicking links from search results, to articles, to more articles. If you aren&#x27;t using an adblocker, I can&#x27;t imagine how you don&#x27;t end up throwing your laptop against the wall. I ended up just turning off JavaScript for most sites, and the web looks more like how I think it should look. Every once in a while these people will post a rant, and it will resonate with most people.<p>But then an Application Developer will read it after a long day and say, hey, wait are you saying I should write my Application (like GMail) in jQuery? To be honest, Applications don&#x27;t bother me the way overscripted Documents do. I almost expect them to be kind of slow. After all, even some Desktop Applications still have loading screens. So I don&#x27;t mind so much if you&#x27;re using React or whatever for your Application or even for that calculator embedded in the article about savings.<p>But for Documents --- like articles, blog posts, company home pages --- well, one thing I agree with SPA developers is that there could be less server-side rendering. These kinds of sites could often be compiled ahead of time into static HTML.  Server-side rendering is better than SPA for these kinds of sites, but static sites are better than server side.

I built a couple myself (albeit not with a Pi, but with some Wemos D1) and can share a few lessons learned.<p>First of all, safeties. I was lucky to add my work to existing motorized garage doors - which already came with enough sensors, but since you are providing everything including the motor, these should be in from the very start, or in any accident you&#x27;d be held liable. Actually you may even be held liable if someone implements it from your github repo and then has an accident. I know you have a disclaimer, but I wouldn&#x27;t rule out being sued.<p>You want a sensor which detects any anomalous power draw in the motor and immediately cuts off power. Something as simple as an ACS712 (follow guides for reading an inductive load though!) which is a couple bucks (or less if you buy a bucket from China). The motor may come with built in safeties if it&#x27;s meant for a garage, but this is something I&#x27;d still consider.<p>You will want not only a sensor but also a couple emergency buttons on both sides of the door which instantly stop all movement.\nWhile you&#x27;re there, activating a couple very visible flashing LEDs for a few seconds before you start any movement is also a good safety precaution.\nYou have 2 relays which could due to a bug or other unexpected circumstance be energized at the same time - Depending on the motor this could cause a fire, or fry your relay board&#x2F;Pi. I would use one relay with its NO contact going to the DOWN motor pin, and the NC going to the UP motor pin, and connect it in series with the other relay which cuts all power. This way it&#x27;s not possible to energize both in any case (beware: even abruptly switching directions may ruin a motor - always cut power first, THEN toggle direction, THEN provide power again)<p>Happy to discuss a few more points if you feel like."],"time":["2020-05-15 10:43:26"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["woutr_be"],"id":[23189743],"kids":[23192989],"parent":[23174493],"text":["Very cool project, I&#x27;ve been wanting to do something with my Raspberry Pi as well.<p>I mainly wanted to focus on turning my AC units on and off.

To start to understand it, find a tool that he uses regularly (assuming such a thing exists).  Maybe it is Excel.  Now have him solve some kind of problem with it.  And then schedule a meeting with his friend the following week to review his spreadsheet.  Then add requirements that his spreadsheet must handle.  Tell him he must hurry so that those requirements are complete before his meeting.  Ensure that there are too many requirements for the spreadsheet or that there isn&#x27;t time to properly reorganize it.<p>In the meeting, explain to his friend that he has been the mastermind of this spreadsheet design.  Have him first demo the calculation features of the spreadsheet.  The have him walk through the design, show the formulas in the cells, explain his naming scheme.<p>The goal of this exercise is to demonstrate why engineers seem to be so concerned about their code organization and technical debt.  Which is that they have their name on any mess they make in the code, and they have to maintain it as it changes.

That is to say, freedom for Nozick is freedom to own and control not just your own personhood, but any property that you own.

Like the comic imagines, a monster that lived forever and bent its entire will to owning more and more land could, theoretically, through entirely voluntary transactions, own all of the land. If this situation arose, the monster would have infinite leverage in any negotiation that it entered into, because everyone on earth would starve unless they made a deal with the monster. From Nozick&#x27;s point of view, because neither party was physically coerced, and the monster&#x27;s property came from a history of free transactions, the monster&#x27;s ownership of all its property is just and free. However, the situation that it leads to seems to be one that severely lacks freedom.

There is a small supply of drugs that treat that cancer. The vast majority of the population would derive little utility from being allocated this drug (there is some small chance that they may get the same cancer in the future, so having it available does have value, just not much) whereas the person who has that cancer derives a much larger amount of utility from the resource. The cancer patient is in this case a utility monster and giving it cancer medicine is feeding the utility monster.<p>Consider even further the case where most of the population is middle class but some fraction is living in absolute poverty. A single dollar provides little utility to the middle class people but a tremendous amount of utility to the extremely poor. Taxing the population some small amount and allocating it to the poor individuals would not only be feeding a utility monster but it would be directly decreasing the utility of everyone else to do so.<p>Let&#x27;s consider a third scenario: a researcher is trying to cure some terminal disease but requires test subjects who may die as various possible drugs are tried. The utility gain from curing a disease once and for all would be immense compared to the life of one or even a few individuals. Carrying out this research is again feeding a utility monster, and in this case literally sending people to their deaths to do so.<p>While people might disagree on how we&#x27;d go about feeding these monsters in practice, society has widely accepted at least in principle giving medicine to the sick, providing welfare to poor, and taking calculated risks in the name of progress.<p>The utility monster only sounds appealing as an ad absurdum argument because the existence of such a utility monster presupposes such an absurd situation. One can easily imagine that a utility monster which derives more utility from every resource than the whole of humanity combined could exist, but actually imagining such a monster is much harder. It feels wrong to support sacrificing the whole of humanity to one being because I can not truly comprehend a situation where one being could derive enough utility to justify such a sacrifice. But in this hypothetical scenario where the sacrifice actually was justified, I would by definition be able to imagine it, and thus I would apply the same logic I do to the utility monsters which I can imagine, and there is no reason to believe I would reach a different conclusion.

For me, LSD and psilocybin - at full trip doses - alter my thought processes.

Then visually the plants, sand and the water started to get that familiar flowing effect, and I started to witness those connections between things in the world, without them having an effect on me. It felt like I was witnessing a psychedelic experience, while still remaining my sober self. I was a little disappointed at first because I enjoy that sense of oneness. Then I sat down on the beach and watched the sunrise. That sense of push and pull between things increasing as I came up, and just let myself enjoy the trip. When I let it, that push and pull took an effect on myself the way it does with LSD and psilocybin. At any moment however I could just come to and be my original self just witnessing.

The people joining had impressive bios, connections in every corner of the tech industry, as well as educators, psychologists, researchers, etcetera. The energy was very real and very exciting at first. It went stale after a few months because everybody was just there spinning their wheels, not accomplishing any action. It began to feel more like talk therapy for people who hate dark patterns and manipulative app design. The leadership of CHT had an amazing start to a real national grassroots network that they could have engaged to push for policy change in states across the country. There could have been organized film screenings, letters to representatives, pushes for legislation, all the usual stuff. But I think they weren&#x27;t ready or able to take advantage of something like that, and the momentum died.<p>So based on that experience if I had to outline a simple 2 step process, I would say: 1. Rally people around something they are passionate about, and 2. Give them something to do besides talk. My experience was disappointing because #1 happened in a really big way, but #2 did not."],"time":["2020-09-11 17:31:35"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["marikio"],"id":[24443770],"kids":[24443965],"parent":[24442569],"text":["You should read the book People Powered by Jono Bacon.

From there you can focus on slower organic growth.  Examples: YouTube and MySpace both began as dating sites.  YouTube focused on getting people to upload introduction videos of themselves.  Once they had accumulated a number of people who were willing to film themselves they pivoted over to content creation.  Similarly, MySpace was a very crude dating site that allowed people to customize their page.  Brad Greenspan was a serial investor who bought up a large number of tiny dating sites.  He cannibalized all the revenue from those sites to promote MySpace as a &quot;free&quot; dating site.  They had millions of users coming from other sites.<p>reddit was promoted heavily on Hacker News and focused on a tech crowd at first.  Paul Graham threw his endorsement behind the platform a few times and that also helped interest people in checking it out.<p>For my successful community sites, I&#x27;ll just mention one experience - I had built a Q&amp;A site from scratch.  It was finally done one Sunday night and I decided to go to bed.  There were eleven posts on the site, mostly from myself, but also a couple from friends I&#x27;d asked to test the site for me.  It was obvious there was no community there.  I bought a single ad - for $10 - at $0.01 CPC on a Quiz site, then went to bed.  My intention was not to launch the site, but to throw a little real traffic at it and see if any bugs cropped up that neither I nor my friends had found.  When I got to work in the morning and had finished catching up on my emails I decided to check the site and see if anyone had posted.  There were over 100 posts and people were using the site exactly as intended.  Not only that but there was about $0.50 in ad revenue already, meaning my monthly run rate was net-positive from day one.  I had hit upon a great fit between people who were already interested in asking and answering questions (the quiz site I advertised on) and my product.<p>In each case I&#x27;m familiar with, the formula was to find an existing audience that had an interest in the product in question and bring them on-board ASAP.  If the internet were brand-new and no community websites yet existed I would build one by building a non-community website that provided a useful service, and building a community around that once I have captive eyeballs.

Programming takes a long time to get good at.<p>I recommend reading Peter Norvig&#x27;s classic essay &quot;Teach yourself programming in 10 years&quot; <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;norvig.com&#x2F;21-days.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;norvig.com&#x2F;21-days.html<\/a><p>It takes two years of programming to really break out of the beginner stage in my experience. I define this period as the period where you have to think much more about writing code than about the problem. The means that you really can&#x27;t do much software development in the true sense because just getting programmings to run and run consistently take a lot of mental effort.<p>Years 3-5 are the intermediate stage where you can solve most common problems without having to think about programming too much, but programming itself is still a source of friction when it comes to completely projects. At this stage you begin to think more about how to structure larger and larger projects, learning some clever techniques, and understanding some of the more specialized techniques in your language of choice.<p>Expertise happens when you don&#x27;t have to think about programming any more and are exclusively concerned with larger design problems. This is the point where you can reasonably write a program and, barring a few typos, will run on the first try.<p>Don&#x27;t stress too much about being a great developer, just keep coding and you will improve."],"time":["2020-09-11 19:42:35"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["gkoberger"],"id":[24444995],"kids":[24445472,24446937,24445637,24446518],"parent":[24444705],"text":["Hey!

That takes bravery and you&#x27;ve started a really interesting thread. I have a couple of suggestions as someone who is self taught in various fields, and the world of programming and music have some bizarre parallels.<p>First, you might be wrong. You may be fine, and just need to back to fundamentals. This is <i>very<\/i> common in many complex fields. I have gone through multiple rounds of taking stuff back to beginning level. I&#x27;m doing it all over again right now in programming. I highly, highly, highly recommend reading &quot;How To Design Programs&quot;. Putting time in to truly and deeply master the very basics as well as you can is the road to mastery in anything complex, and it&#x27;s never too late to do this.<p>Second, you may not be totally wrong, you may be slightly off target on how you like to think best! There are a lot of people out there who like computing and programming, but discover that really, they are better off as someone in a related field, or that they like a different kind of coding. In my experience, the best low-level coders are often terrible architects (very high level software design), because they can&#x27;t imagine being wrong! Also, some people naturally gravitate for whatever reason to sysadmin&#x2F;dev-ops style stuff, or security testing, or embedded electronics. Or perhaps you have better than average ability to understand how people make software and would be an excellent development manager.<p>So my advice is to take a two-pronged approach:<p>A) Go back to fundamentals and learn new languages, both high and low level.<p>B) Experiment with related areas and see if one of them makes you say &quot;ah damn this is what I should have been doing&quot;.<p>And C) give yourself like a good year or two to figure this out.

Many people are quite bad at learning because the process is counterintuitive. People mistake the feeling of mastery for learning, and it&#x27;s not at all a productive feeling (if you want to learn; it&#x27;s great at building self-confidence). My advice:<p>1. Focus. Acknowledge that you have surface level familiarity in many things, but that nobody can or should go deep in everything. Pick a language you&#x27;re using professionally, and focus on that. If you don&#x27;t currently have a job, try to pick something with broad applicability like Python or Golang. Also eliminate distractions: email popups, SMS, facebook, HN&#x2F;reddit, Slack, all must go while you focus.<p>2. Study. Now that you have a language you want to build expertise on, study it methodically. Start an Anki[1] deck for it (and run through reviews daily) -- this is your tool to &quot;try smarter&quot;. Get a set of beginner books from the library&#x2F;amazon. Run through a codecademy or similar online course series. Make new Anki cards as you go. When you&#x27;ve finished a book, start working on the easiest online problems you can find online. Sort Leetcode[2] by acceptance rate -- many make the mistake of trying them in order, or by difficulty tag, and get frustrated when they hit a stumbling block. Learn from their failures. Once you solve a problem, review how others solved it and try to understand their code: did they use arrays or objects? did they use recursion? obscure syntax you need to look up? Which code base is cleaner, and easier to read?<p>3. Pace yourself. This is a marathon not a sprint. Improvement will be slow, and it will not feel good. If you have a job, I&#x27;d limit myself to 1 hour a day on professional improvement. If you&#x27;re searching for work, I&#x27;d still limit myself to 4h daily. I try to spend about 10 minutes a day on Anki, just to retain what I&#x27;ve learned. People spend 4 years of their life on this stuff, after all.<p>4. Advanced study. As you advance beyond the material in step 2, look for conference talks at your level. Read through the official documentation. Start browsing StackOverflow or similar for your language tag[3]. Keep making Anki cards and reviewing them. Maybe pick up a CS textbook to shore up theoretical shortcomings and study 10 pages a day (textbooks tend to be denser reads than other reading material, so again, pace yourself.). Start with freshman undergrad stuff like Data Structures -- nearly universal in application and immediately useful. Or since you feel anxious about it, a book on OOP.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ankiweb.net&#x2F;about\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ankiweb.net&#x2F;about<\/a>\n[2]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;leetcode.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;leetcode.com<\/a>\n[3]: Little known secret: the most viewed questions aren&#x27;t the ones with the most votes, they&#x27;re the ones that novices google the most.

I would welcome more.<p>The author is correct that C++&#x27;s greatest weakness, and one that can never be fixed, is that other code can do things that violate the model your code depends on. It is not enough to have your own discipline, the rest of the system needs to observe the same discipline at interfaces. And there are many possible, correct disciplines to choose from.<p>Rust imposes one of the possible disciplines for memory-object management that enforces one set of non-negotiable tradeoffs and costs. You the programmer are relieved from choosing a discipline or discovering what was chosen, and from discovering that two subtly different ones were used in different parts of the system.<p>Memory-object management is not the only place where systems need a consistent discipline, but others can often be referred to it; and every program needs at least the one, besides any others.<p>Arguably the reason Common Lisp never took off is that practically nothing can be assumed about any other part of a system. C++ has enough forced consistency to drive adoption, but might better have had more. C++ has a lot more tooling than Rust does to capture semantics in libraries, so the library is the natural boundary for a discipline, and it is not unusual to find more than one safely co-existing, but it is also not unusual to find them not safely encapsulated, and in conflict.<p>Ultimately there is no substitute for sound design.

PMTUD remains the proper way to handle things, or something like PLPMTUD if you&#x27;re not willing to assume IP. Some things create path MTU black holes, commonly firewalls but also APs. APs can be particularly troublesome because nowadays they commonly don&#x27;t terminate the wireless encryption, the controller at the other end of the tunnel does, which means they can&#x27;t inject an ICMP to let the client know that packet is too big. MSS saves the day (for TCP) but otherwise the AP can either drop or fragment at the encap layer transparent to the client. I&#x27;ve yet to see a system that delivers the fragmented tunnel packet so the controller can ICMP back that the packet is too big but it&#x27;d be the cleanest thing in that scenario.<p>Also if you&#x27;re going to limit tunnel size arbitrarily beforehand probably best to make sure the resulting packet ends up being able to fit into 1428. A lot of products use a 1300 &quot;inside&quot; MTU for this (and similar) reasons. 1400 + auto IPsec calc will lead to trouble in this scenario.<p>Don&#x27;t drop &quot;inside&quot; MTU below 1280 in IPv6 networks.

I remember when I was reading the Unsupervised Cross-Domain Image Generation[1] paper and my immediate thought was &quot;yep, I can see this going south&quot;. And sure enough, not long after deepfakes became a thing. GPT-3 is absolutely astonishing in terms of it&#x27;s capabilities and I&#x27;d love to be able to dig into it&#x27;s inner workings and scroll through it&#x27;s code. The truth is there are three stoppers for the large majority of people who would love to exploit it.<p>1. Data. For better or worse obtaining a dataset that big isn&#x27;t a great deal if you really want to. Gutenberg project, wiki corpus, the reddit dumps - difficult but definitely doable.<p>2. Costs - training the model costs $5M which is a considerable amount of money by anyone&#x27;s standard(rich people will also have a second thought when they hear that number). But there is a catch - the hardware is becoming more and more accessible. Remember when a server grade GPU like P100 was ~10k a piece? And now the high end 30X series are 1&#x2F;10th of that and have better specs... Adjust those numbers and you get something close to 20x price decrease in the course of 4 years(iirc p100 came out 2016).<p>3.

A few years ago, I spent $399 for a point-and-shoot digital camera that took decent photos under decent lighting conditions.  It supported resolutions up to 1920x1080 or so.  DJI just sold me a camera for the same price that takes better photos.  Also, it takes videos.  Also, it fucking <i>flies<\/i>.

If a new feature is too risky or isn&#x27;t mature enough, it can be pushed to a future model, at least until the design is locked.

It helps to have a recommendation, but roles are rarely filled by asking the team who they would most like to work with an approaching them. Normally companies advertise roles and try to use some kind of standardized process. So CV writing and interview technique are critical.<p>Promotions often happen because people apply for the role up when it is advertised competitively. My observation is that people succeed at this by focusing on performing against their current objectives, not being a problem, requesting training, and picking up the tasks relevant to their current role that will be on the job description for the next one up. That next role up might be in another team so your own teams favor matters less. The main thing is not to have been a problem to management and to present yourself well during the application process.<p>I think external upwards moves are more likely to be powered by skill at believable exaggeration, and internal promotions by rules compliance and consistent ambition driven box ticking.<p>Finally, some people get promoted because management need someone they trust to do that job now, at least temporarily.
