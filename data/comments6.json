That criticism may be fair.<p>Static types do not help at all with software quality, beyond catching some typos.

Public Infrastructure in the disaster management system is a - disaster.<p>Example: Yes, my home village and the surrounding 20-30 Villages all have their old air-raid sirens to notify the members of the fire brigade. A system which is quite old and was rock solid reliable. During the transistion from analog radio to digital radio, the receivers were upgraded to be triggered by digital radio (TETRA to be precise). This, we found out, now means that during a power outage, there is no way to alert the fire brigade because the sirens dont have power. We now have people sitting in the fire station again whenever our Village has a power out to use the on-vehicle radio to communicate with the dispatch.<p>TETRA itself is also a disaster. And even worse: Its not even universally accepted. This means that local muncipalities can decide to stay with the old analog system while others have the new digital one. \nIn theory, the digital one has a bazillion advantages. However, all of those advantages in the end create more problems than they solve.<p>For example, better voice quality - just leads to people being completely not understandable when using breathing masks to enter a building (Something to do with filtering).<p>Also, analog fails gracefully. Digital stops working. And it stops working a lot earlier. This means, you now have to use a repeater at the entrance of a building to talk to people in the building, because the digital radio often does not work. This happens mostly in direct (Walkie Talkie Mode)<p>When in cellular mode, good luck finding a signal in 50% of the rural areas - This mode is vital to talk to the dispatcher to call for support&#x2F;additional units.<p>The whole system is supposed to be used by everyone. Military, Federal and Local Police, Fire Brigade, EMT... which means there has to be a rights management system to access certain channels. This is hardcoded into every device. This often means that a device does not have the permission to cooperate or that only the one device of the commander can access certain channels.<p>There is a 2 Second delay between pressing the talk button and a connection being established due to the encoding and permission management leading to people often having to resend because the first words were cut off.<p>Its just a complete and abject failure everywhere.

I now play multiple instruments and enjoy a much broader array of music than I ever did as a student, playing and singing American traditional, Irish, and folk music with my family and other people.

From there you can focus on slower organic growth.  Examples: YouTube and MySpace both began as dating sites.  YouTube focused on getting people to upload introduction videos of themselves.  Once they had accumulated a number of people who were willing to film themselves they pivoted over to content creation.  Similarly, MySpace was a very crude dating site that allowed people to customize their page.  Brad Greenspan was a serial investor who bought up a large number of tiny dating sites.  He cannibalized all the revenue from those sites to promote MySpace as a &quot;free&quot; dating site.  They had millions of users coming from other sites.<p>reddit was promoted heavily on Hacker News and focused on a tech crowd at first.  Paul Graham threw his endorsement behind the platform a few times and that also helped interest people in checking it out.<p>For my successful community sites, I&#x27;ll just mention one experience - I had built a Q&amp;A site from scratch.  It was finally done one Sunday night and I decided to go to bed.  There were eleven posts on the site, mostly from myself, but also a couple from friends I&#x27;d asked to test the site for me.  It was obvious there was no community there.  I bought a single ad - for $10 - at $0.01 CPC on a Quiz site, then went to bed.  My intention was not to launch the site, but to throw a little real traffic at it and see if any bugs cropped up that neither I nor my friends had found.  When I got to work in the morning and had finished catching up on my emails I decided to check the site and see if anyone had posted.  There were over 100 posts and people were using the site exactly as intended.  Not only that but there was about $0.50 in ad revenue already, meaning my monthly run rate was net-positive from day one.  I had hit upon a great fit between people who were already interested in asking and answering questions (the quiz site I advertised on) and my product.<p>In each case I&#x27;m familiar with, the formula was to find an existing audience that had an interest in the product in question and bring them on-board ASAP.  If the internet were brand-new and no community websites yet existed I would build one by building a non-community website that provided a useful service, and building a community around that once I have captive eyeballs.

That takes bravery and you&#x27;ve started a really interesting thread. I have a couple of suggestions as someone who is self taught in various fields, and the world of programming and music have some bizarre parallels.<p>First, you might be wrong. You may be fine, and just need to back to fundamentals. This is <i>very<\/i> common in many complex fields. I have gone through multiple rounds of taking stuff back to beginning level. I&#x27;m doing it all over again right now in programming. I highly, highly, highly recommend reading &quot;How To Design Programs&quot;. Putting time in to truly and deeply master the very basics as well as you can is the road to mastery in anything complex, and it&#x27;s never too late to do this.<p>Second, you may not be totally wrong, you may be slightly off target on how you like to think best! There are a lot of people out there who like computing and programming, but discover that really, they are better off as someone in a related field, or that they like a different kind of coding. In my experience, the best low-level coders are often terrible architects (very high level software design), because they can&#x27;t imagine being wrong! Also, some people naturally gravitate for whatever reason to sysadmin&#x2F;dev-ops style stuff, or security testing, or embedded electronics. Or perhaps you have better than average ability to understand how people make software and would be an excellent development manager.<p>So my advice is to take a two-pronged approach:<p>A) Go back to fundamentals and learn new languages, both high and low level.<p>B) Experiment with related areas and see if one of them makes you say &quot;ah damn this is what I should have been doing&quot;.<p>And C) give yourself like a good year or two to figure this out.

The most objective criteria you can ever pull from is, regardless of the messiness or efficiency of the solution, whether you’re able to solve problems. If I asked you to do some work, and you could do it in any amount of time, that is the most difficult milestone many fail to achieve — And it seems that bar is more than met with you.<p>Perhaps you are worried with the quality of your solutions. I’d argue that in many situations, it comes down to domain knowledge. That is something you will naturally gain as you continue to code and read about CS theory, and especially so if you keep exposing yourself to new things out in the wild or at work. Brilliance is often witnessed or measured by the application of domain knowledge, but the genuine underlying brilliance comes from your ability to recognize patterns and having the discipline to see things through to a working solution.<p>You’ll almost always find yourself with company that can work faster or slower than you and be different shades of brilliant, because our brains gravitate towards different things when we hear about a problem. It is not easily compared, and when forced it easily becomes unfair and unproductive.<p>If you had to leave this post with anything, it’s this: don’t you dare judge your programming abilities by the typical big tech interview. They are created in a way that tries to gauge your critical thinking skills, and sometimes that is executed quite well, but more often it requires arcane domain knowledge that demands deliberate and specific attention you would be unlikely to give and come across otherwise. It is a specific process that is related to our daily work, but do not get it confused with the actual work we do. Many incredible programmers are rejected because they haven’t nailed the interview domain — that’s okay and can still be consistent with being a good developer.

Maybe some sort of mentor relationship would be helpful?<p>3) I generally find solutions are easier to understand when I&#x27;ve personally struggled with the problem they are trying to solve. Look at code for problems you are familiar with and try to figure out what patterns&#x2F;OOP concepts are being used in the solution.

Especially important about things that one thinks one is &quot;terrible&quot; at, or that one thinks one is &quot;great&quot; at.<p>There are a lot of lenses through which to see one&#x27;s own capabilities, and it is not uncommon for a person to be a consensus of one about themselves. Others may think a terrible person is great, and vice versa.<p>It&#x27;s important to have conversations with other folks about these issues, to understand where one stands.

If one is uncomfortable in one kind of translation role, there are many other kinds, many other trajectories.<p>OP mentions having wide knowledge of other &quot;tech&quot; topics- I would advise thinking about that as a skill and think of it from a &quot;translator&quot; perspective. What community does the person with those skills translate from, and who do they translate to, and what domains would they work in.<p>There&#x27;s much more, but those are my top level thoughts:<p>1.

Many people are quite bad at learning because the process is counterintuitive. People mistake the feeling of mastery for learning, and it&#x27;s not at all a productive feeling (if you want to learn; it&#x27;s great at building self-confidence). My advice:<p>1. Focus. Acknowledge that you have surface level familiarity in many things, but that nobody can or should go deep in everything. Pick a language you&#x27;re using professionally, and focus on that. If you don&#x27;t currently have a job, try to pick something with broad applicability like Python or Golang. Also eliminate distractions: email popups, SMS, facebook, HN&#x2F;reddit, Slack, all must go while you focus.<p>2. Study. Now that you have a language you want to build expertise on, study it methodically. Start an Anki[1] deck for it (and run through reviews daily) -- this is your tool to &quot;try smarter&quot;. Get a set of beginner books from the library&#x2F;amazon. Run through a codecademy or similar online course series. Make new Anki cards as you go. When you&#x27;ve finished a book, start working on the easiest online problems you can find online. Sort Leetcode[2] by acceptance rate -- many make the mistake of trying them in order, or by difficulty tag, and get frustrated when they hit a stumbling block. Learn from their failures. Once you solve a problem, review how others solved it and try to understand their code: did they use arrays or objects? did they use recursion? obscure syntax you need to look up? Which code base is cleaner, and easier to read?<p>3. Pace yourself. This is a marathon not a sprint. Improvement will be slow, and it will not feel good. If you have a job, I&#x27;d limit myself to 1 hour a day on professional improvement. If you&#x27;re searching for work, I&#x27;d still limit myself to 4h daily. I try to spend about 10 minutes a day on Anki, just to retain what I&#x27;ve learned. People spend 4 years of their life on this stuff, after all.<p>4. Advanced study. As you advance beyond the material in step 2, look for conference talks at your level. Read through the official documentation. Start browsing StackOverflow or similar for your language tag[3]. Keep making Anki cards and reviewing them. Maybe pick up a CS textbook to shore up theoretical shortcomings and study 10 pages a day (textbooks tend to be denser reads than other reading material, so again, pace yourself.). Start with freshman undergrad stuff like Data Structures -- nearly universal in application and immediately useful. Or since you feel anxious about it, a book on OOP.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ankiweb.net&#x2F;about\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ankiweb.net&#x2F;about<\/a>\n[2]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;leetcode.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;leetcode.com<\/a>\n[3]: Little known secret: the most viewed questions aren&#x27;t the ones with the most votes, they&#x27;re the ones that novices google the most.

Someone reviews and comments on your work based on what they see in front of them, and not how they know you as a person.<p>There is absolutely no mention of bias in the paper nor the study design can really account for this.<p>&gt;  “While the research phrases it academically as ‘personality,’ what they mean is someone’s ability to interact with others: the application of social interaction skills as well as technical skills.”<p>This is false for big-five personality traits. The most explicitly social trait is extraoversion-intraversion scale. Rest of the traits e.g neuroticism or conscientiousness has aspects that has nothing to do with social interactions but interacting with self or the environment (e.g orderliness).<p>&gt; He considers himself to be open and conscientious ... Foster describes herself as “primarily conscientious with a bit of agreeableness,”<p>That is not how big-five works. The factor analysis that result in traits are only statistically significant when the big-five inventory is taken (and only once). Self-ascribing these traits have no value in the context of big-five.<p>&gt;  “Developers are very much like artists, in that they can be very sensitive to criticism and place a very high value not only on their work, but on the acceptance of both their work and who they are.”<p>Contradictingly, study finds high neuroticism translate into higher acceptance of pull requests."],"time":["2020-09-11 09:11:23"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["GolDDranks"],"id":[24445175],"kids":{},"parent":[24444347],"text":["What library are you using?

It is not enough to have your own discipline, the rest of the system needs to observe the same discipline at interfaces. And there are many possible, correct disciplines to choose from.<p>Rust imposes one of the possible disciplines for memory-object management that enforces one set of non-negotiable tradeoffs and costs. You the programmer are relieved from choosing a discipline or discovering what was chosen, and from discovering that two subtly different ones were used in different parts of the system.<p>Memory-object management is not the only place where systems need a consistent discipline, but others can often be referred to it; and every program needs at least the one, besides any others.<p>Arguably the reason Common Lisp never took off is that practically nothing can be assumed about any other part of a system. C++ has enough forced consistency to drive adoption, but might better have had more. C++ has a lot more tooling than Rust does to capture semantics in libraries, so the library is the natural boundary for a discipline, and it is not unusual to find more than one safely co-existing, but it is also not unusual to find them not safely encapsulated, and in conflict.<p>Ultimately there is no substitute for sound design.

PMTUD remains the proper way to handle things, or something like PLPMTUD if you&#x27;re not willing to assume IP. Some things create path MTU black holes, commonly firewalls but also APs. APs can be particularly troublesome because nowadays they commonly don&#x27;t terminate the wireless encryption, the controller at the other end of the tunnel does, which means they can&#x27;t inject an ICMP to let the client know that packet is too big. MSS saves the day (for TCP) but otherwise the AP can either drop or fragment at the encap layer transparent to the client. I&#x27;ve yet to see a system that delivers the fragmented tunnel packet so the controller can ICMP back that the packet is too big but it&#x27;d be the cleanest thing in that scenario.<p>Also if you&#x27;re going to limit tunnel size arbitrarily beforehand probably best to make sure the resulting packet ends up being able to fit into 1428. A lot of products use a 1300 &quot;inside&quot; MTU for this (and similar) reasons. 1400 + auto IPsec calc will lead to trouble in this scenario.<p>Don&#x27;t drop &quot;inside&quot; MTU below 1280 in IPv6 networks.

American companies have built a lot of cool science fair projects that get lots of media attention, but minimal real-world deployment – from light shows to food delivery.  We also design a lot of interesting low-volume consumer drones, but most of them lean heavily on Chinese R&amp;D and then go on to have their product manufactured in China.  Yes, I know, I am fully aware I did the same thing years ago with Oculus.&quot;<\/i><p>He&#x27;s not wrong.  A few years ago, I spent $399 for a point-and-shoot digital camera that took decent photos under decent lighting conditions.  It supported resolutions up to 1920x1080 or so.  DJI just sold me a camera for the same price that takes better photos.  Also, it takes videos.  Also, it fucking <i>flies<\/i>.  It can fly for over 20 minutes, shoot a 1080p or 2.7K video two miles away, and find its own way back home.  Uncle, already.<p>In a completely-unrelated anecdote, some <i>other<\/i> people in China just sold me a 3 GHz vector network analyzer with performance and features comparable to a $10,000 portable VNA model from Keysight.  It cost $70, batteries included.  (And in an amusing bit of irony, its Chinese designer is currently upset because some other Chinese people used its CC-licensed design and GPL-licensed firmware to undercut her own Tindie offering.)<p>Not many people will find the second example very meaningful, but quite a few people can appreciate the first one.

Possibly you can but the nearest I&#x27;ve managed to get so far is (from memory) C-x 5 f, which brings up the minibuffer prefilled with the pathname of the directory you&#x27;re browsing in dired, and then you have to start typing the filename (which, granted, will autocomplete), which seems somewhat redundant, and only then can you open the file.<p>It&#x27;s also full of things to trip you up, like the key bindings for switching to another (emacs) window and killing a buffer - both fairly common operations - being far too similar and easy to confuse for a newbie.<p>It just seems so deliberately contrary, but I&#x27;m hoping the investment will pay dividends given time and persistence (this is, however, approximately my fourth or fifth attempt in 20 years to learn emacs, so we&#x27;ll see)."],"time":["2020-09-10 13:45:31"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["submeta"],"id":[24430708],"kids":[24430725],"parent":[24430108],"text":["Emacs + org has the potential to be the dream environment for everybody with a hacker mindset: Automate everything that has to do with text: Journaling, writing todo lists, parsing your Kindle highlights file (`My Clippings.txt&#x27;), writing project outlines, doing web research and saving your searches, notes, thoughts, summaries in Emacs via org-capture, drafting papers in org-mode, creating (text-based) tables and overviews, writing tech documentation with embedded screenshots, and many many more.<p>What ties all these notes and files together is Emacs Lisp: Write Lisp functions to automate most of what you do. - Previously I used Python for that, but Elisp is so much more fun to automate text-based workflows.<p>I would have to write a book to summarize all the ways this can transform your interactions and workflows with your computer and especially with everything text.<p>Edit:<p>After twenty years of using all sorts of text based databases and PIMs (AskSam, NetManages ECCOPro, various outliners, Outlook, Evernote, Omni{Focus,Outliner}, Bear Writer App, Ulysses App, and half a dozen other tools) I have come to realize that nothing beats Emacs + Org + Lisp."],"time":["2020-09-10 12:05:59"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["II2II"],"id":[24432809],"kids":{},"parent":[24430108],"text":["Most of the comments seem to be missing a very important point from the post:<p>&gt; As a blind user, I can write a special mode which does something specific, say, implement an IRC client.

It helps to have a recommendation, but roles are rarely filled by asking the team who they would most like to work with an approaching them. Normally companies advertise roles and try to use some kind of standardized process. So CV writing and interview technique are critical.<p>Promotions often happen because people apply for the role up when it is advertised competitively. My observation is that people succeed at this by focusing on performing against their current objectives, not being a problem, requesting training, and picking up the tasks relevant to their current role that will be on the job description for the next one up. That next role up might be in another team so your own teams favor matters less. The main thing is not to have been a problem to management and to present yourself well during the application process.<p>I think external upwards moves are more likely to be powered by skill at believable exaggeration, and internal promotions by rules compliance and consistent ambition driven box ticking.<p>Finally, some people get promoted because management need someone they trust to do that job now, at least temporarily. This happens when a new project team is created and someone is told they are in charge of it, or someone quits and their duties are reallocated to an immediate report. These reward competence yes, but such a people keep their winnings or fall back by their actual short term success - if things look shaky management go out externally for a permanent replacement and quietly put them back where they were.<p>I don&#x27;t really see any of this changing due to work from home.<p>It is probably different at high levels of management because these roles seem to be filled more based on relationships."],"time":["2020-09-10 16:11:33"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["api"],"id":[24431360],"kids":[24432162,24431507,24431588,24431443],"parent":[24431169],"text":["I am hoping remote work will “nerf” in person charisma.

With Caddy and its ask point we just created a simple microservice which is hit each time there is a request to Caddy to issue the certificate, returns status 200, and we are good to go. It has been marvellous to use in our k8s setup with Redis plugin.<p>I&#x27;m also really happy that you improved startup time with 2.2.0rc1, because we had problems as our setup is massive (over 8000 domains and certificates). It took 17m previously when we redeployed the app for the pods to startup, now it takes ~30s which is quite ok as we also have autoscaling in place.<p>As of the docs, I also find it a bit confusing, coming from v1. :) I use Caddy for my personal stuff as well and it was quite a learning curve to get the same setup I had before work in v2, but as you said, it is one-time only so it is okay.<p>Keep up the great work!"],"time":["2020-09-11 11:37:04"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["ksec"],"id":[24435730],"kids":[24435954],"parent":[24434709],"text":["Ok.<p>1.

Following this space for a long time, Nikola has always been by far the shadiest of all these companies.<p>They were one of the very few companies that claimed revolutionary battery technology. This is an instant red flag and a huge one. New revolutionary batteries don&#x27;t just just happen.<p>Sila Nanotechnology, is only replacing anode materials, and they have been at it since 2012 and don&#x27;t expect to be in cars until 2025. Quantum Scape, who want to make Solid State Li Anode batteries is not gone be in cars until 2025.<p>There were a number of other companies who also did this &#x27;we have revolutionary batteries&#x27;. Some actually believed they did. Dyson is a good example, they wanted to create a car, and to achieve their targets, they invested lots of money including in batteries. However since they are a honest company they eventually admired that they couldn&#x27;t hit their engineering targets and abandoned the project.<p>A Nikola competitor in the arena of bullshit spinning is Henry Fisker. His first company made lots of nonsense claims, including about batteries, but unlike Nikola they actually went threw the trouble and made some investment in future battery tech, just not credibly commercial ones. They went bankrupt. His new company is right back to the old bullshit spinning way but they have lower their ambitions and just open say they want to buy the VM MEB platform, now they are gone be the most &#x27;sustainable&#x27; among other claims.<p>As a comparison, Tesla &#x27;revolutionary&#x27; technology at battery day will likely not be a silicon anode or a lithium anode, those are simply not ready for commercial use. Revolutionary battery technology would be 10-20% energy density improvment and 30-50% longer lifetime maybe 2x faster production speed, and Tesla has been working on this for 5-10 years and have spent many 100s of millions acquiring a set of companies and having research agreement with multiple universities that all work in collaboration. In total I would guess to really bring a new cell to market at scale, you are talking 5-15 years and 5 billion $, and that is still with basically conventional cell chemistry.<p>Much of the same can be said about Fuel Cells. Toyota, Honda and also the Koreans have been banging their head against the fuel cell wall for 30 years, with heaps of government money to back them up. They know they can&#x27;t make it work, even with their massive resources. In personal vehicles they are not competitive against EVs in the slights (while also not being an improvement in CO2 compared to Gas) while in trucks they are not competitive with Disel or Natural Gas, and soon electric trucks are gone take the majority of routes over as nobody can compete with their price on these short and mid distant routes.<p>But Nikola are gone make it, and not for a geographically small place like Japan, but for the gigantic US without much government support either.<p>Another topic is that of product announcements. If you follow Nikola for many years, or you go back to 2016 and look at their announcements there is a funny effect that happens. People can say about Elon Time what they like, but mostly the products actually do come out and often are improved over the original announcement in a number of ways. Nikola shows the exact opposite pattern. It goes something like this, announce revolutionary new product but its 3-5 years out. Then progressively lower the specs over time, while pushing the time to market out further.<p>The hype for anything EV related has been insane. Quantum Scape is a fine company for example, but they have valuation that is insane for a company that is not gone make real money for many years and not gone make profits for many more after that. They essentially have a technology that requires a totally new manufacturing system, while competitors like Sila can put their materials in existing facilities claim the same level of improvements. I wouldn&#x27;t expose myself to a unique technology with so much competition<p>There are tons of EV startups and they differ widely from Lucid, Rivian being serious companies step by step putting in place a solid car company. Dynamic companies like NIO coming out of China. And there are the bottom feeders like Nikola, Fisker and others that surf on the hype.<p>This is gone be a massive market shakeout with Tesla being the leader hunted by everybody. Slow moving giants like VW, Toyota and so on finally realizing whats happening and taking methodical step after step. And a massive wave of startups from around the world, especially China trying to be next next big thing.

They&#x27;ve done a mostly brilliant job in creating a very minimalistic Civ-style 4x game. Has two modes: a 30 turn game in which the player with the highest score wins. Building wonders and temples gives more points than conquest, so that mode is a very stripped down version of a cultural victory goal. And then there&#x27;s the free-for-all mode, with no turn limitations and the only possible victory is conquest. I mostly play the latter.<p>There&#x27;s a simple tech tree. Diplomacy is done in an interesting way, and I wish more games would emulate it. There&#x27;s no direct negotiations, relationship scores, or anything like that. Instead, you have to measure how they feel about you by the way they act. They give you a greetings when you first meet. If they laugh at you or are suspicious, then they&#x27;ll probably attack immediately. If they worship you or condescendingly pat you on the head, then they won&#x27;t attack for a while.<p>And this is also built on by judging them based on further actions. If you move a unit adjacent to theirs, and they don&#x27;t attack it, then you know they&#x27;re trustworthy for a time. And you can subtly manipulate their feelings towards you by doing things like not counter-attacking even when they&#x27;re attacking you. This is useful in a multi-front war when you&#x27;re losing. You can make the decision to concentrate an offensive on one front when your defenses can possibly hold on a second front. If the enemy isn&#x27;t hellbent on your destruction, they&#x27;ll possibly just stop attacking and do something else. If you accurately guess that they hate another nation more than they hate you, then attacking the hated nation will get them to consider you acceptable. It&#x27;s a bunch of big gambles and an interesting ones. Judging the other nations&#x27; attitudes towards you by intuition alone.<p>That definitely adds a little nuance to the conquer-the-world bits. Most games are over in 30 minutes or less, though occasionally they stretch out when you&#x27;re evenly matched.

Didn&#x27;t get much chance to use it myself, but later gifted the code to some programmers who ran a fan site and were interested in it."],"time":["2020-09-11 01:00:42"],"type":["comment"]}]
