It could be worse.<p>We once got a couple of high end motherboards for AMD processors, back in the Win98 era, and I tried to install Win95 on one of them. The box said that Win98 was required, but it couldn&#x27;t hurt to try, right? Maybe there would not be drivers for some of the peripherals, but all I needed was the CD-ROM and hard disk to work.<p>Install is going fine until it is time for it to reboot. That failed. It didn&#x27;t even get to the BIOS initialization screen. It appeared to just be dead.<p>Figuring we just got unlucky and got a defective motherboard or processor, I tried installing on the other one so I could get on with my work.<p>That one died too.<p>Eventually I found something about this on the motherboard maker&#x27;s support site. The problem was with the device probing during install.<p>What I&#x27;m about to say is not made up. As unbelievable as this might sound to people who grew up with more modern PCs, at one time they really did work as I&#x27;m about to describe.<p>The early PC buses had no built-in way for the host to identify what cards were plugged into the expansion slots. Typically, an expansion card would have a set of jumpers or DIP switches that could chose between several sets of possible addresses for the card&#x27;s registers to appear in I&#x2F;O space.<p>The user was expected to keep track of the settings of all cards they installed, and adjust the jumpers appropriately to avoid conflicts, and record the settings in a config file that the drivers would read to find out where their card was.<p>Later buses, such as EISA and later PCI, provided ways for the host to find out what is there and how it is configured. But operating systems still needed to support the old bus, and they wanted to make this as user friendly as possible.<p>So systems like Win95 would have a device probe during install that would try to identify what is on your old bus. They would do this by very carefully probing the I&#x2F;O address space.<p>For example, suppose you know that a particular network card if present has to be at one of 8 addresses, and you know that after power on or reset that certain bits will be set in its status register and certain bits will be clear. You can read those 8 possible addresses, looking for the right bit pattern. If you don&#x27;t find it, that particular network card is not present. If you do find it, you can do more tests to confirm it.<p>Some of those other tests might involve writing to the device registers, and seeing if it responds the way that network card should.<p>This is obviously risky. What if it is not that network card, but rather a disk controller card that just happens to have a register that after reset has the same bit pattern you expect in the network card status register? The thing you write then to verify it is the network card might be the &quot;FORMAT DISK&quot; command to that disk controller.<p>And so you had to be very careful with these probes. They had to be done in a safe order. You&#x27;d need to probe for that disk controller before you probed for that network card.<p>Those new motherboards contained peripherals that Win95 did not know about, and so the Win95 probe procedure did not know how to avoid doing bad things to them.<p>One of those peripherals was the built in interface for flashing the BIOS EEPROM.

I often use a 200-500mm lens. If I switch the camera to a cropped sensor mode I get a 1.5 x increase in effective focal length (i.e., 850mm) while still getting a 24 mPx (5408 x 4584) image. The D850 also has very low sensor noise, which makes shooting in low light a pleasure.<p>If I want an image of some friends for a typical social media application, then, yes, I will use my smartphone and get something that is usually good enough. But, for my main application - wildlife photography – there is just no comparison. I want to be able to see the detail of the individual feathers on a bird. And now I’ve gone up the learning curve, unless I make some stupid mistake, the camera will always get a shot if there is one to be had, not let the opportunities slip away because I can’t control the focusing or similar.<p>[Edit] The D850 also has a tolerable DSLR video capability, although video autofocus sucks a bit. Shooting video at HD resolution, it has some very impressive live view focusing guides (sharp objects are highlighted in red) and a live histogram display. HD or 4K video with a 850-effective mm lens is truly awesome. The newer mirrorless Nikons (Z series) are functionally very similar from a video perspective.<p>Also, if I want a stunningly fast burst mode for &#x27;small&#x27; (1920 x 1080) JPEG-quality images, I can use slow-mo video to get 120 frames per second."],"time":["2020-06-03 14:18:31"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["ageitgey"],"id":[23401664],"kids":[23401744,23401828],"parent":[23389437],"text":["As a long-time hobbyist photographer, I&#x27;ve had a lot of the same thoughts.

These higher-tech cameras take pretty cool shots all of the time, but they&#x27;re just guessing as to what might make a good shot, and they have built-in limits. So if I&#x27;m taking an afternoon to shoot, I&#x27;m taking my DSLR.<p>Oddly, the newer mirrorless camera has been the most disappointing, probably because I had such high hopes. It&#x27;s great tech, it&#x27;s just not a professional part of a photography workflow. Once I stopped thinking I could take pro pictures with it, it got more fun.

For the documentary photographs most people want to take, there is no camera that wouldn&#x27;t meet their needs.  They are close (literally arm&#x27;s length) and there is usually plenty of light.  Any camera will be good under these conditions.<p>The challenge comes when you want to photograph something unusual.  The biggest disappointment I&#x27;ve had in recent memory was sitting on a ferry at night, surrounded by what seemed like the blindingly bright and infinitely large city skyline.  Basking in the glow, I knew I wanted to take a picture, so I busted out my iPhone.  All I got was a blurry sphere or two surrounded by pitch blackness.  I wasn&#x27;t close and I didn&#x27;t have a lot of light, so the choice in camera didn&#x27;t work.  (I know my a7 would have handled this admirably at ISO 1600.  I kind of forgot there were stars in the sky until I started using that thing at night -- I can&#x27;t see them, but the camera can.)<p>Digital processing can help here -- AI denoising, using frames of video stacked on top of each other and carefully shifted by using accelerometer data to simulate a longer exposure, motors that move the sensor around, etc.  But often you can look at one of these pictures and tell that it&#x27;s synthetic -- not capturing the moment you saw as you saw it, but looking like what you saw shaped by 1000s of other similar moments composited together by an AI.<p>I have yet to find the perfect camera.  Big sensors collect a lot of light, but require big bodies and big lenses.  Small sensors are always with you, but fail when you&#x27;re about to take the most interesting picture.  There is probably not a workaround for this, so I think you&#x27;ll find a lot of people with big cameras for years to come."],"time":["2020-06-03 19:29:54"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["0x01DEED"],"id":[23414372],"kids":{},"parent":[23389437],"text":["In digital photography there are two steps:<p>STEP 1:\ncapture the light and save it in 0s and 1s<p>STEP 2:\nprocess the original 0s and 1s into a new set of 0s and 1s that is much more pleasant to the eye<p>-&gt; DSLRs do STEP 1 extremely well and STEP 2 poorly.

Probably this is why DSLR companies haven&#x27;t invested a lot in upgrading the STEP 2 functionality (so far).<p>-&gt; Smartphones do STEP 1 poorly but they do STEP 2 extremely well using algorithms. So they cater for different needs: When you want to sacrifice STEP 1 for convenience, when you just want a decent photo fast, when you&#x27;re not that opinionated about the final outcome and would rather let smartphone decide it etc etc. Also, because they can&#x27;t do STEP 1 very well, they are limited to a specific photography style, the &quot;everyday well-lit snapshot&quot; style.

Photographers want fidelity, so they can apply their own edits in post, so a deciding factor is maximizing post-processing freedom.<p>Cameras are more for professional&#x2F;artistic use these days.<p>2) Phones are never ever going to replace professional cameras. Hell, not even non-professional cameras are ever going to replace professional cameras. I have a Canon 5D as my main camera and a Sony RX-100 mkIII as a travel camera, and while the latter is fantastic, has great quality in a very small form factor, I end up frustrated 30% of the times I use it. The 5D is a professional camera, and much of what you pay for is for the ergonomics.<p>It&#x27;s very cumbersome to have to go three menus down to change a setting in the smaller camera when I could have done it without taking my eye away from the viewfinder on the 5D, and it leads to missed shots. I haven&#x27;t seen this point mentioned anywhere, and it&#x27;s a big differentiator.<p>I could include here the fact that the camera is much more predictable: If you hear the &quot;beep&quot; that tells you it&#x27;s focused, pressing the button gets me a photo in &lt; 100ms. Phones have a will of their own, and it&#x27;s pretty random when you&#x27;ll actually have your photo. Cameras focus in a few milliseconds exactly on the subject, phones focus somewhere in the vicinity of where you asked, at some point soonish. This leads to a much better, more solid-feeling experience when using a camera.<p>3) Phones are great for taking wide-angle photos in ample light, but not great for everything else. They can clean low-light photos decently these days, but a large sensor is much more versatile in what you can do with it. The same goes for the lenses, 24mm is good for a lot of things, but sometimes you just need a different focal length.<p>4) Larger sensors have a <i>lot<\/i> more detail in the resulting photo. A camera lets you go from the before to the after here, and this isn&#x27;t even a terrible shot: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgz.org&#x2F;ius5Vhb9&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgz.org&#x2F;ius5Vhb9&#x2F;<\/a><p>A phone wouldn&#x27;t be able to retrieve much detail in that scene, and the result would look much worse. A camera can help you salvage many photos that would have been write-offs with a phone, e.g. when they&#x27;re too dark&#x2F;bright, or when you have tones too close to each other.<p>TL;DR: Phones are great, but cameras are great too."],"time":["2020-06-03 13:06:05"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["dghughes"],"id":[23403475],"kids":[23418642],"parent":[23389437],"text":["Cameras are like fast food they&#x27;re quick and cheap but not as good as &quot;home cooked&quot;.<p>I think the early 2000s are going to be the fuzzy ages of pictorial history."],"time":["2020-06-03 16:09:19"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["PragmaticPulp"],"id":[23403636],"kids":[23405967,23403947,23404523,23403766,23404324],"parent":[23402639],"text":["It looks like Take-Two studios didn&#x27;t want to pay the the premium of having another studio do the work, so they switched to recruiting the employees directly instead.

In order for them to easily accept my eccentricities, I have to provide a rationale, even though I&#x27;m well aware that many of the thing that I do are not motivated by reason but instead my unconscious.<p>There&#x27;s more minor reason that I tell personal noble lies, which is that if someone asks me why I do X thing, and I actually tell them the truth, said truth is usually ridiculously simple, in which case they think that I&#x27;m blowing them off.  In these cases, it&#x27;s better for interpersonal relations for me to have either a canned story , or make something up on the fly, that&#x27;s more interesting than the real one.<p>The first example that comes to mind is my father, whom is a great man in my eyes but, if we haven&#x27;t talked in a while, he will ask me &quot;What do you eat these days?&quot;  Depending on whether I&#x27;m trying to lose weight, I may have literally no rhyme or reason behind my eating habits.  Often times, I couldn&#x27;t tell you what it is that I tend to eat or have eaten.  If I told my father &quot;I don&#x27;t know.  I eat lots of things and don&#x27;t think about it much.&quot;, I can tell that he interprets that as me trying to end the discussion.  In that case, I don&#x27;t necessarily make up a total lie, but I will try and remember the things I ate in the last few days and then speak like those are the things that I eat all the time, and I might even say something like &quot;I eat the steak and eggs a lot because I&#x27;m trying to build some muscle.&quot;<p>Another example has to do with my mode of dress.  Anyone who knows me knows that I wear the exact same outfit 7 days a week, 365 days a year.  I wear a black t-shirt that&#x27;s well fitting, jeans, and dress shoes.  This is a bit of a strange outfit to some, and the dress shoes are funny to most people.  The real reason that I dress this way is that I don&#x27;t want to waste time and brain power deciding what to wear and in what combination; I don&#x27;t care what I look like so long as what I look like is acceptable and fits my self image.  This is not a satisfactory answer to most people, in my experience, and I suspect it&#x27;s because they simply don&#x27;t relate.  The average person doesn&#x27;t see the value in removing unnecessary choice from their daily routine, and their choice to wear a particular garment may indeed be necessary to them.  So what I tell them is that I like to wear black because it doesn&#x27;t stain, and I wear the dress shoes because they happen to be very water resistant when I step through puddles."],"time":["2020-06-03 15:06:02"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["stcredzero"],"id":[23408188],"kids":{},"parent":[23402343],"text":["<i>I think it must be a lot easier to be a weird misfit now than it was in 1935.<\/i><p>In Columbia, SC in the 1990&#x27;s, all of us misfits hung out with each other.

For example, New England settlers appointed Indian Constables to police Native Americans (National Constable Association, 1995), the St. Louis police were founded to protect residents from Native Americans in that frontier city, and many southern police departments began as slave patrols. In 1704, the colony of Carolina developed the nation’s first slave patrol.

The only difference is that they’ve been indoctrinated from early childhood to accept their slavery. And in the case of the police, they’ve been conditioned to accept the enforcers of their enslavement as something good and beneficial to themselves, when in fact, the police exist to enforce whatever the masters dictate and to protect the masters and their economic interests from the slaves. This fact is proven on a daily basis worldwide; whenever and wherever the slaves rise up against the current system of enslavement, the police rush in to suppress them.

That we can make them nice, friendly community outreach workers. But police are violence workers. That&#x27;s what distinguishes them from all other government functions. ... They have the legal capacity to use violence in situations where the average citizen would be arrested.<p>Look at American policing from a Northern European perspective in general and a Norwegian perspective in particular it is pretty clear to me what some of the problems are.<p>American police has VERY SHORT TRAINING which from what I have read is very focused on the use of violence. Even the rule of engagement emphasize shock, terror and control, rather than de-escalation.<p>You become a police in the US in mere weeks in a very military style Academy.<p>In Norway and I believe much of Europe police training is a lot like taking a Bachelor degree running several years. Training emphasize a lot on social work, psychology, human rights, understanding behavior of people with mental problems, the criminal mind etc.<p>What I have seen from US police recruitment videos seems to be that they are essentially recruiting some sort of soldier. In Norway it is much more like recruiting a social worker. For instance far more women work in the police here. And I know from people who have worked in security that a common strategy here is to pair up women with bigger guys because women are often good at defusing situations. They often make people calm down more easily. Big testosterone brutes shouting loudly, don&#x27;t calm people down.<p>The US has a violent police force because that is how they are trained to be. That is the kind of people they are recruiting and that is how they get equipped.<p>It seems profoundly wrong to just sort of &quot;GIVE UP&quot; on policing all together when there are so many flaws in how it is done.<p>It does not mean I entirely disagree. I do in fact agree that policing in the US covers far too many areas. People call cops for things that would be unthinkable here in Norway. The barrier to calling the police in the US seems exceedingly low.<p>Like you see minor disorder in a class causing police to be called. Police is called to handle situations a teacher should handle.<p>And yes the US does of course use its police and prison system as a compensation for having no functioning welfare state. Because the US does not want to pay money to take care of poor people they instead pay triple to have the police handle problems a much cheaper civilians agency could have handled.<p>But I guess in the US it is much easier to get funding for police than for &quot;soft&quot; government type of jobs.

I have been holding out hope for more push-to-talk apps on desktop platforms. It&#x27;s such a step up from always-on listening. As an audio engineer, I grit my teeth every time there is microphone feedback, echo, or other audio issues on group calls, and these generally don&#x27;t occur on PTT apps because everyone tends to be muted most of the time. And if it does start happening, the user more easily realizes what they did wrong because they correlate it with the button press. In fact, even if the user does not realize what they did wrong, others on the call can identify the source because &quot;it&#x27;s only happening when Jane speaks.&quot; I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I&#x27;ve been on a call with feedback where the person who is causing it is complaining about it to the group without realizing it&#x27;s their own fault and others on the call don&#x27;t necessarily know, either. This never happens on PTT calls. There&#x27;s also the obvious privacy benefits, as it avoids the issue where people speak without realizing they are unmuted. PTT is better in nearly every respect. I&#x27;m very excited about this.<p>I do have some questions that the website doesn&#x27;t answer for me:<p>1. What about screen sharing? Seeing the word &quot;collaboration&quot; implies to me that I should be able to do so, but it&#x27;s unclear. In the screenshot of the app, I see an icon or two in the right-hand sidebar that might be relevant to this, but they seem kind of generic.<p>2. What about mobile devices? I routinely do Slack calls where one or two people are on their phone for various reasons. It would be useful to know if that is supported or will be at some point.<p>3. I want to know more about the encryption. As you&#x27;re probably aware, there has been a lot of controversy over the security of Zoom. In particular, there is an ongoing lawsuit related to their false claims of end-to-end encryption. [1] I think any new product, especially a chat app, that claims to be end-to-end encrypted really needs to show us the details of its protocol and stack, and ideally open source as many parts of that as possible. Does it use the Signal protocol? The site says &quot;Squawk groups are invite-only and end-to-end encrypted.&quot; But which parts are E2E encrypted? The group membership? The message content?

If you look at the history of silicon valley in the 1970s it was Chip companies in the 1980s it was PC hardware companies in the 1990s it was networking companies and the 2000s it was internet companies and in the 2010s it is transportation companies.  The chip cpu companies have been ejected from silicon valley (vlsi design happens in oregon and austin).  The PC hardware companies have been ejected from silicon valley (motherboard design and I&#x2F;o design in Asia and oregon).  Cisco is struggling to hang on but they are being ejected from silicon valley.  People are packed into cubicles like sardines there.<p>The fact is if you have a lot of money silicon valley is the nicest place to live in the richest (overall) country in the world.  in these fields you are 100% mobile and the work can be done anywhere so people choose to live with their peers in a place with more recreational and cultural opportunities than anyplace else on earth.  And yes they struggle to afford it.  Yes there is an underclass with lesser skills who might be well-served by moving to a lower income city or state but they are a fraction - maybe 20% of silicon valley.<p>People leave silicon valley for Boulder or Seattle most often.  more land, less housing pressure, and almost as many recreational opportunities!<p>if a guy like this wants to know the answer he should talk to my friend who started a 20 million dollar software company in Chicago and then moved to Prague to try to repeat it and he knows exactly why software engineering doesn&#x27;t scale in Eastern European countries!

And yes, I actually like it. Windows 10 on a Dell Latitude or XPS is stable, fast and I can run everything under the sun. Office applications, very domain specific applications like the Adobe suite, uncountable useful utility software, cross platform tools like Gimp, Blender or Krita. And still there are many, many applications I absolutely love which run on Windows only.<p>The half-baken &quot;Flat UI&quot; trend in Windows or the telemetry does not <i>really<\/i> concern me. Really, it is no deal for me and my colleagues. Embrace, Extend, Extinguish? Oh come on. I&#x27;m far more concerned about Microsoft losing against other players. That&#x27;s the world you should be afraid of.<p>The best thing about Windows though is Visual Studio. The general consensus is, that it&#x27;s slow, clunky and hard to use. But actually, that tool is so utterly powerful, streamlined and deep, that every other development environment I every used is missing something of its glory.<p>And I also love Linux in some ways. I used all different kinds of distributions, either through dual-boot or through Virtualbox, but actually the only thing I really use it for is server-side web-development. And well, what can I say. I love the server side applications. But all those arcane commandline wizardry and the configuration madness still irks me now and then.<p>But well, to return on topic: It&#x27;s clear that I mostly work with clients, which mainly use Windows. And there is a lot of software written for Windows environments which can probably never be replaced by other software running on Linux. The thing is, that the push of Microsoft to cross-platform .NET Core or even cross-platform UI (MAUI) opens up those applications to other environments.

Here&#x27;s why: at least in NYC, I know the protest leaders and the NYPD police chief got together just a day or two ago to have a dialog and try to mend things so they can work together instead of against each other. [1] They don&#x27;t hate each other, and in any case, both sides realize they need the other&#x27;s support. They just want to be able to work together to keep things peaceful. And it seems like they&#x27;re giving each other another chance to do things right, and it&#x27;s important that they get that chance instead of having more tensions flare again as a result of anger from 3 days ago.<p>So, before you get worked up about what happened, check the date, and try to see if there&#x27;s any local news in the city that might indicate something might have changed in the meantime. You won&#x27;t necessarily see these on frontpage headlines, so it might take a bit of digging. (I&#x27;ve found actual videos from local news reporting on the ground much more helpful than textual articles from national outlets here. It seems to me it&#x27;s just too difficult to capture all the relevant dynamics, emotion, and nuance in text.)<p>In fact, if anyone&#x27;s involved, I would suggest putting this information in the repo here as well. You don&#x27;t want to add fuel onto a fire that was already under control a few days ago, and you want to know when (or whether) good progress is being made. Ultimately the goal is to find a working model that others can hopefully emulate.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=SJGT06zIUiY&amp;t=2m32s\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=SJGT06zIUiY&amp;t=2m32s<\/a>"],"time":["2020-06-03 07:56:42"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["Melting_Harps"],"id":[23399852],"kids":[23399981],"parent":[23399533],"text":["Thanks for doing that, during the Hong Kong protests the (presumably) CCP were attacking doing ddos attacks and trying attack servers that hosted footage of the police illegally beating, arresting and pepper spraying lawful citizens protesting or simply just having the misfortune of being around one when the HKPF&#x2F;PLA decided to get violent.<p>Here is the torrent hash if anyone wants to host it and seed:<p>9b85dd223c8f92c923f516ed77bbdfcb770f4dd8<p>&gt;  I vouched for this.

The reality is that the vast majority of them likely condemn the events around George Floyd&#x27;s death. They are also regular people with families, children and friends they have to provide for. And they have the exact same problems that many of us do. Their daily work involves keeping things in order, which is something I respect. That said, the first video I opened at random[1] shows a small number of people blocking a road in what looks more like a civil war scene rather than a protest. And the authorities are greeted with &quot;F-U&quot; and people tossing objects at them. The people in uniforms are ordinary people. Put yourself in their shoes and tell me: having all the problems you have, seeing all the destruction, which in all cases is no longer a protest, people shouting &quot;f-u&quot; and throwing stuff at you: You can be the most mentally stable human being but everyone has a limit. Many of those men are possibly working overtime, in extreme conditions and I bet they would much rather be with their kids or sick parents for instance. With this idea in mind, I personally can&#x27;t picture myself being able to remain calm and not overstep my boundaries sooner or later.<p>Now putting myself in the shoes of the protesters: seeing the same destruction, destroying of properties, cars and businesses, I&#x27;ll call it a day because this is no longer a protest. I&#x27;d go back home and wait for this to be taken care of and join a civilized protest once this has been taken care of. A civilized country should be able to hold a civilized protest. And having spent most of my life in eastern Europe, you can say I know a thing or two about protests. Last large protest I was a part of was in ~2013 irrc and the aftermath was very different. The night after each of those protests, everything was spotless clean, people thew all their garbage in the bins, nothing broken or destroyed. People were coming with their children and pets and being completely comfortable with it. There was a completely unrelated incident of a gas explosion at a Chinese restaurant, which burned a nearby shop. People gathered donations fo the shop owner to recover. Incidents with police? Practically none during ~3 months of daily protest. And we are talking eastern Europe - the police officers are anything but the nicest people on the planet.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;XruthxNthr&#x2F;status&#x2F;1266903223220097024\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;XruthxNthr&#x2F;status&#x2F;1266903223220097024<\/a>"],"time":["2020-06-03 07:34:33"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["sneak"],"id":[23400033],"kids":{},"parent":[23399533],"text":["Please put the media clips into the repo.

All configurable, naturally. Bonus for more complex filtering rules—like my mail inbox, really. Yeah I could write it but that&#x27;s one more thing to carry around and another thing that would leave me helpless on machines that aren&#x27;t mine, or aren&#x27;t my main OS, or whatever. It should be built into the OS or file manager.<p>I also think there are lots of different kinds of files and handling them all the same isn&#x27;t great. Ideally my editing-format documents would actually be a container holding an archive of &quot;finished&quot; versions of them (not just every time I&#x27;ve hit save, and certainly not a complete undo history or anything) so they all move around together and can&#x27;t get separated. Same for photos, probably—keep an original and any edited variants I&#x27;ve made <i>all in one file<\/i> and only (and automatically) split them up (export one of them) when it makes sense to do so.<p>[EDIT] example of otherwise-good software that tries to do some of this organization for me on-file-open but fails at it: iBooks. There are two main categories of ebooks I open: those I want to keep around permanently, and those I just want to look at for a little while then I don&#x27;t need it anymore, <i>or<\/i> that I want to keep around but strictly associated with some other files on disk. Opening a .epub adds it to my icloud-backed-up iBooks library every single time. This is perfect for books I want to keep but sucks for books I&#x27;m just opening for a second, because then I have to go delete them, or keep a second (probably worse) ebook reader around and understand both programs&#x27; features. I have two types of .epub, then, with different use cases and organizational patterns needed—I need an &quot;add to library?&quot; prompt when I open them. IIRC Calibre does something similar and can&#x27;t be my <i>only<\/i> ebook reader for the same reason (which makes me want it not to be an ebook reader at all, just an organizer accessible through an open-with menu)<p>[EDIT 2] Oh it&#x27;s just called &quot;Books&quot; I guess.

I&#x27;ve learned to optimize my notes for information retrieval, rather than easy entry -- spelling out new acronyms, for example -- with the goal of making it searchable later. I think there was a HN post about personal note taking last month, re: productivity.<p>I&#x27;m heavily command-line focused and my preference for long-term storage is Markdown.<p>I use PDFs in only a few ways:\n- References, bulletins, bills, etc. through `less`. `:r!less foo.pdf` will load it into vim, and I tend to check those into vimwiki. Editing by hand allows individualized tags, and anonymization, which is important in my sector.\n- Articles via Mandeley (but this is overkill unless you want to cross-reference between new articles)<p>I distribute my home directory with rsync and backup regularly with restic. Both have sophisticated exclude rules, if you need &#x27;em. restic observes the tar-compatible CACHEDIR.TAG droppings, which is easier to use than rsync&#x27;s proprietary rule filters. For example, a properly-formed CACHEDIR.TAG in ~&#x2F;.local&#x2F;cache will direct tar and restic to skip that big directory.<p>To edit a remote file, slice out something important for later into notes, `vim scp:&#x2F;&#x2F;remote&#x2F;path` is a neat trick. Only a few keystrokes to put it into vimwiki, or vice-versa (edit the remote file by inserting part of a locally-stored note). vimwiki is the only plugin required.<p>Many of my systems are shared between multiple human users. On home systems, some users are only interested in using file shares (not terminal access). I create groups Videos, Music, Photos, etc. Make each human user&#x27;s respective directories stickied to those groups, and you can read (and, importantly, backup) without `sudo` intervening (see `sudo -n` if you find yourself toiling over this). On home and work systems, I use `stow` perhaps more than I should: I build with PREFIX=$HOME&#x2F;.local&#x2F;$toolname, then stow it into place with `cd ~&#x2F;.local ; stow -S $toolname`. This allows custom builds of, say, `cmake` or `git` without system-wide changes. Oh, for Python 2 specifically, I install my own pip out of reach of anyone else.<p>`stow` is a symlink manager intended to lubricate different UNIX packages that are individually lodged under &#x2F;usr&#x2F;local&#x2F;stow. It&#x27;s written in Perl, so some systems (early stages of linux-from-scratch, for example) have xstow, which does not have Perl dependency. I see a lot of comments here about ~&#x2F;Desktop and ~&#x2F;Photos management, so here&#x27;s one idea:<p>Create ~&#x2F;Archive&#x2F;2020-06&#x2F;{Desktop,Photos} and, inside ~&#x2F;Archive run `stow -S 2020-06`. This creates symlinks ~&#x2F;Desktop -&gt; ~&#x2F;Archive&#x2F;2020-06&#x2F;Desktop and similar. When you feel like dumping weight, script up something like `mkdir 2020-07&#x2F;{Desktop,Photos} ; stow -D 2020-06 ; stow -S 2020-07`. The timestamped organization is preserved for you without having to interact with timestamps.<p>PS&gt; The screenshotting facility is underdeveloped for command-line workers. I&#x27;d rather be able to grab the local tmux scrollback buffer, throw it into the editor, possibly saving it to notes, even if just temporarily. An image would be unacceptable, so I overrode the screenshot key to grab tmux scrollback if in focus. This permits a specific search when I can&#x27;t remember the branch where an obscure error occurred years ago.<p>PPS&gt; You can script your own capabilities for `less` to open nonflat files. It automatically throws PDFs through pdftotext, but you may desire something like:\n- Pretty-print and colorize JSON\n- Read OpenOffice docs\n- Syntax highlighting\n- Parse SSL certificates"],"time":["2020-06-07 01:52:19"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["fastball"],"id":[23415079],"kids":{},"parent":[23404900],"text":["I&#x27;m on MacOS, so some stuff I keep in the folders that come with an account by default.<p>~&#x2F;Desktop&#x2F;: nothing here, don&#x27;t like the clutter.<p>~&#x2F;Documents&#x2F;: mainly just files stores by applications, I don&#x27;t intentionally put anything here<p>~&#x2F;Downloads&#x2F;: self-explanatory, but I try to keep this clear by either deleting, cataloguing, or short-term storing everything in here.<p>~&#x2F;Downloads&#x2F;stored&#x2F;: a sort of temporary &quot;not important enough to catalogue, but I&#x27;ll maybe use it more than once so I&#x27;ll keep it around for now&quot; folder.<p>---<p>~&#x2F;Sites&#x2F;: websites that I&#x27;m working on, generally as git repos so not backed up to cloud<p>~&#x2F;Repos&#x2F;: all my other git repos not in ~&#x2F;Sites&#x2F;<p>~&#x2F;Repos&#x2F;external&#x2F;: git repos that I don&#x27;t own but that I&#x27;ve forked<p>---<p>And then the big kahuna, where I actually store everything* that has ever been created by me digitally, which is backed up to cloud...<p>~&#x2F;Cranium&#x2F;: the root folder, which has two sub-folders<p>~&#x2F;Cranium&#x2F;cortex&#x2F;: the long-term storage, well-organized &quot;catalogue&quot;.

I wrote a program that, whenever a new hidden dir&#x2F;file is added to my home directory, it automatically moves it to this folder and then symlinks it back into the home directory.

I spend about 50% of my time reading, 25% writing, and the other 25% coding, so my organisation is highly focussed around that workflow at the moment.<p>1. I follow BSD guidelines where possible (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.freebsd.org&#x2F;doc&#x2F;handbook&#x2F;dirstructure.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.freebsd.org&#x2F;doc&#x2F;handbook&#x2F;dirstructure.html<\/a>), with the extension of a portable ~&#x2F;.local&#x2F;bin directory of scripts that&#x27;s symlinked to my dotfiles.<p>2. Projects (mine or otherwise) live in ~&#x2F;Repositories, with reverse domain name. E.g. ~&#x2F;Repositories&#x2F;gitlab.com&#x2F;harritaylor&#x2F;project name. I am a heavy user of z (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rupa&#x2F;z\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rupa&#x2F;z<\/a>), so the big nesting doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. I found that if I tried to organise it into some ~&#x2F;work ~&#x2F;projects directory I would spend time messing around with it&#x2F;organising and sometimes even kept two distinct versions of software projects going. Oh, also: I use `git grep --line-number -e &quot;TODO&quot;` to keep track of what I need to do in a project. I really tried with stuff like org mode, but in the end I found it was so much easier to just drop a &quot;TODO&quot; in a comment within the context of the code, and use a high level description of the problem in my separate notes.<p>3. I keep a ~&#x2F;Notes directory for <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;obsidian.md\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;obsidian.md<\/a>, with a subfolder of ~&#x2F;Notes&#x2F;pdf&#x2F; for papers. This is synced via git to my iPad with working copy to markup notes, as I find it a lot easier to read and process papers on the sofa rather than at the desk. For each paper I make a markdown file of notes with the name of the reference (author:year.md), and keep all my citations organised in my ~&#x2F;Notes&#x2F;references.bib file.<p>4. I use bookmark OS for anything found on the web that is not immediately useful (usually from hacker news and twitter), rather than cluttering up daily notes or git cloning it. I used to use pocket for this but I&#x27;ve recently split &quot;to read in downtime&quot; and &quot;to research&quot; into two different services to avoid burnout. I dedicate around an hour a week pruning this after I have worked through my reading list.<p>5. &quot;Working documents&quot; such as current presentations or paper drafts live on the desktop for quick reference in meetings, as well as immediate reminders that they still exist.<p>6. I haven&#x27;t figured out a useful way of organising my documents otherwise: I currently treat ~&#x2F;Documents as an archive, organising by context (freelance, phd, private), and the folder prepended by the most specific time `YY_MM_DD-name`. It&#x27;s super clunky, it doesn&#x27;t really work, but it&#x27;s the best thing I&#x27;ve found so far.<p>This setup is totally portable by design, and I have reproduced this working environment between my work mac (boo, I know), a linux VM on a windows PC, and my remote linux workstation. The biggest revelation for me personally was the ~&#x2F;Repositories and `z` combination.

It took some doing.<p>Net result: the repo has a package.json and a src&#x2F;index.js like a JS project, plus a Cargo.toml and a src&#x2F;lib.rs like a Rust project. This feels appropriate since the Rust files in this project are really application code calling out to a #[no_std] Rust library, just like the JS files are application code calling out to JS libraries.

The subversion of the Justice Department is unprecedented. The White House going <i>months<\/i> without a press briefing is unprecedented (in modern times). The erosion of public institutions doesn&#x27;t seem to matter. Nor does the public trust in those institutions. Winning matters. Getting your agenda through no matter what matters. And that&#x27;s so dangerous.<p>This, by the way, is why mandatory voting (as we have in Australia) is so important and so much better. In the US, the election process itself is politicized. What you have is highly organized efforts aimed at voter suppression because people are allowed not to vote so much so that the GOP had to enter into a 35 year consent decree to prevent voter suppression [1].<p>What a lot of liberals don&#x27;t understand (for the record, I include myself in that camp) is how angry the idea of activist judges makes conservatives.<p>In US constitutional law you really have two major schools of thought: the &quot;living document&quot; school and the &quot;literalists&quot;. The second group think the constitution says what it says. If you want to change that, there&#x27;s a process for that (ie a constitutional amendment). The &quot;living document&quot; school thinks the constitution should be viewed through the lens of the times and it asks questions like &quot;what would the Founders have written or meant today?&quot; Broadly speaking, literalists are the conservatives and &quot;living document&quot; types are liberals.<p>Judicial conservatives think there was no <i>constitutional<\/i> basis for the SCOTUS decision to legalize gay marriage. They feel like &quot;dignity&quot; was another invented right, just like &quot;privacy&quot; was an invented right that legalized abortion in Roe v. Wade. And whether or not you agree with those things in principle, you shouldn&#x27;t dismiss how strongly many voters feel that legislatures not judges should enact those things.<p>I strongly believe the combination of the SCOTUS gay marriage decision and having a black president while the candidate was HIlary Clinton was the perfect storm that was the only thing that could get Trump elected.<p>But here&#x27;s this relates to party over democracy: by any measure, Trump is a reprehensible human being. The level of hypocrisy required for religious conservatives to stand behind him is truly astounding.

Following that, you can start to understand variational inference, as well as topics relevant to modern deep learning like amortized inference, variational autoencoders, etc..<p>[1] Kulis &amp; Jordan 2012, &quot;Revisiting K-Means:  New Algorithms via Bayesian Nonparametrics&quot; (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;people.eecs.berkeley.edu&#x2F;~jordan&#x2F;papers&#x2F;kulis-jordan-icml12.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;people.eecs.berkeley.edu&#x2F;~jordan&#x2F;papers&#x2F;kulis-jordan...<\/a>)\n[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;benrbray.com&#x2F;static&#x2F;notes&#x2F;eecs445-f16-em-notes.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;benrbray.com&#x2F;static&#x2F;notes&#x2F;eecs445-f16-em-notes.pdf<\/a>"],"time":["2020-06-03 22:29:42"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["izzydata"],"id":[23404540],"kids":[23404641,23404562,23405717,23404792,23405238,23408567,23405449,23404822,23404659],"parent":[23404030],"text":["I wish we would all collectively agree not to use Twitter or consider it an inappropriate place for such communication.

Once a public figure or celebrity has grown beyond a certain size—I don&#x27;t know what the threshold is, but it&#x27;s lower than 1 Zuckerberg—they become a generic theme, and people mostly just repeat their pre-existing feelings about them, as well as practicing the social rituals that humans do on such occasions.<p>Public figures of this sort become cartoon characters [1]. The way we relate to them reminds me of how the Greeks used to talk about their gods, and at times also of the feces-hurling behavior in other primates. I don&#x27;t mean that  dismissively, I mean it almost literally (e.g. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23406290\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23406290<\/a>).

Social curiosity is what lies behind gossip, fascination with celebrities, and so on—the lives of others, if it&#x27;s ok to adapt that phrase. Intellectual curiosity has to do with expanding one&#x27;s view of the world. Both are deeply human, but HN is a site specifically for intellectual curiosity.

Think multiple years. I started 4.5 years ago and it took nearly 4 years until I felt fully comfortable. Slow growth is to be expected. My growth curve, in fact, isn&#x27;t a curve at all: it&#x27;s pretty much a straight line if you plot paying customers. It looks better for MRR (monthly recurring revenue, your main metric), because I&#x27;ve been working on raising ARPU (average revenue per user).<p>The &quot;long slow saas ramp of death&quot; is real. Google it.<p>You can supposedly grow faster if you do marketing well. But from what you wrote I&#x27;d guess that you do not do marketing well. My adventures with marketing came down to the following conclusions:<p>* Spending money on ads is basically burning money and does not work for me. (tried Google Ads, LinkedIn, Facebook ultra-targeted ads, Quora). This became painfully obvious after I implemented my own conversion tracking, because I did not trust their metrics&#x2F;analytics.<p>* You will find plenty of marketing experts all around you, but none of them will work for a commission, which speaks to how much trust they really place in their &quot;skills&quot;.<p>* Since I am a solo founder, I eventually decided that I&#x27;m OK with my organic growth and I&#x27;d rather concentrate on making the product better. This helps in building bigger product value, improves customer retention, allows me to raise the ARPU, and in general works great. I just don&#x27;t get the marketing-pumped stream of new customers. But I&#x27;m OK with that, especially at this point.<p>That said, I think I would expect more than 8 paying customers after a year. My ramp-up in the first year was slow (the product didn&#x27;t have a lot of value back then), but it was quicker.

You want to see how often people are looking for a product like yours or your competitors.  Make an Adwords campaign with the right keywords, bid high enough to always be shown first, and then run this for a while to get an idea of what the search traffic is like.<p>Second experiment is to see what portion of that customer base you can capture.  So, continuing on from the previous experiment, you now want your site to be set up, and then measure what percentage of those searches result in people actually clicking on your site.  And then what percentage of those clicks result in them actually putting in their credit card information and paying for the first month.  If you can&#x27;t have people signing up on their own, then give them a form to submit their information instead, and then make some estimate on what percentage of those will fall through.<p>Then, that gives you an idea of what your baseline growth is.

If we compare Copenhagen and the city on the Swedish side of the bridge called Malmö, we find that Malmö has less cases and deaths while not having any of those specific restrictions. Why? We don&#x27;t know for sure, but the main suspect are the number of elderly people living in care homes. When it come to Sweden more than half of all death comes from elderly care in the area around Stockholm, and Malmö does not have as many as Copenhagen and much fewer than Stockholm.<p>From there we can speculate all day long on what kind of restrictions do help. Maybe keeping children under 16 at home forces the typical demographic that are employed at elderly care to also stay home. Maybe Sweden, or Stockholm, use a different strategy in handling elderly care than other countries&#x2F;regions and that is the culprit. Maybe other countries did more to prevent the virus from getting a hold in the elderly care system by providing employees more equipment and more time.

As is frequently being emphasized: It&#x27;s too early for a verdict here. We&#x27;ll know in hindsight.<p>But then there is another perspective: The one based on risk-reward, and based on what is the right thing to do in the moment for a democratic, humanist society that generally promotes values based on protecting lives, particularly of the weak.<p>Confronted with a new, evidently potentially very dangerous virus about which few things were known other than it created chaos in various places and led to many deaths, Sweden chose a gamble based on a rather bad risk-reward distribution. Let&#x27;s say Sweden will turn out to be &quot;right&quot; in the long term (meaning other countries will eventually also end up with similar numbers of fatalities&#x2F;infected per capita), then the reward will be at best moderate: A slightly better economy (as an export-nation, Sweden&#x27;s economy suffers when other countries shut down regardless of Sweden&#x27;s own strategy) and a bit more individual freedom for people to do what they wanted even during crisis times.<p>But if Sweden should turn out to be wrong (meaning that other countries manage to keep numbers of fatalities&#x2F;severely sick much lower indefinitely, and economies will only do a bit worse, until we have a vaccine, or until the virus has mutated to become much weaker), then the downside is gigantic:  Thousands of people whose life could have been saved, thousands more who had to fall severely sick who could have been spared this experience, a damaged global reputation (which is one of the most important things for Swedes: What others think of their country) as well as a moral identity crisis (because how to justify future signaling of moral superiority if one has just sacrificed thousands for an utilitarian ideal?!).<p>Ethics and moral aside, choosing a strategy with such a bad distribution of reward and risk strikes me as highly dubious.<p>Furthermore, based on my own personal ethical&#x2F;moral set of values, the damage is done. Even IF Sweden will look better once we&#x27;ll be out of the pandemic, the whole strategy was inevitably based on an ethically questionable gamble, which could have gone either way, and which as I see it sets a rather concerning precedent.<p>If one crosses a highly trafficked street with closed eyes, even if one makes it to the other side unharmed, the worst outcome is if one concludes that this was smart and should be repeated again in the future.<p>As I see it, Sweden went on a dangerous path, historically taken by those who turned out to be on the wrong side of history. \nI moved from Germany to Sweden in 2006 but I’m not sure anymore if this is a great country for the future.
