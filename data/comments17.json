You write code in SQL, a programming language unlike any other mainstream programming language. Instead of writing code with for loops and if statements, you write it with joins and where clauses. On top of that, Postgres has a &quot;magical query optimizer&quot; that takes your SQL and figures out how to execute your query.

Contrast that with Notion (which is great in many other ways), where I store my data on their cloud and even though I can export to markdown not everything is actually markdown (e.g. tables) so they just put a link to their site instead.<p>I also love that since this is locally stored, I have control of how I store my data. I have a private git repo, and just occasionally commit and push my changes.<p>I wish it were open source, that way I could feel better about the wiki links being useless if they go out of business. It&#x27;s not a blocker for me though, since my notes are fairly straightforward and I mostly just use the links for table of contents files.<p>The downside of being locally stored is that it isn&#x27;t cross-device capable. This limits me when I&#x27;m taking notes on my iPad. That said, I don&#x27;t take many notes on my iPad so if I need to I can just manually transfer my notes when I get back to my computer. I can understand though that this would a be a show stopper for some people.<p>Overall, this solution works for me.

It&#x27;s crazy the amount of waste. I watched nothing happen for 3 years other than catastrophic failure and honestly I&#x27;m glad to be gone and not working with them.<p>Military projects have it the worst. Depending on the program and funding, they either have access to modern tooling or such little funding that it prevents them from using something made in the last century. This company probably has one of the most impressive development tool catalogs a company can have, but most developers can&#x27;t even take advantage of it. They have everything and a lot of the teams I worked with just couldn&#x27;t use the stuff so the licenses sit on shelves burning cash. They renewed software we migrated away from, just in case... for auditing purposes. WTF?<p>They always had a crazy security protocol for why they cant do something too. I get it, defense is important. They tell me they want an air gapped system for X, cool here is the link to software X and MD5 from our authorized site&#x2F;customer area. They&#x27;re not allowed to download it, I still get it. Looks like I&#x27;m traveling to Colorado to hand over a USB stick. Without a second thought, I watched the SRE plug it right into his machine. Dude no. WTF? This would have been safer to download. Countless screen shares with people exposing private keys and passwords. The list just goes on and on and on. It&#x27;s security theatre.<p>This company is also in love with the H1-B program.

They are specifically gouging people from India. Couple this with their time tracking policies which I wont cover, their business practices are fairly absurd and rather disgusting.<p>Purchasing, holy balls. Every team purchases software differently. There is no consolidation or money saving practices. This has to do with funding, but someone could do this more intelligently. I tried having the conversation with them. Boeing, we want to give you back 250K in savings a year by not having 45 pieces of paper, it&#x27;s a burden for us too. They don&#x27;t care. Nothing matters over there. You follow the policy or look for a new job&#x2F;vendor. It made me really sad having to work with them.

I have to share my social security number with many people, but also somehow keep it safe?  Instead, I should have a public and private key pair, and this could be associated with my National Social Media account for a single identity, and sign messages with my private key if I need to apply for a loan, or a lease, or whatever.<p>The National Social Media account could enshrine the same protections afforded by the US constitution - free speech, you cannot be censored top down, only by people blocking you.  The government cannot spy on your usage patterns or edit your messages, and so on.<p>If Trump were to get such a thing created, and it worked reasonably well, and he started using it exclusively instead of Twitter, I think it would gain a lot of traction.

The veracity of twitter’s fact checking. This absolutely does not matter, since Twitter may host or refuse to host whatever they want on their own website, including incorrect fact checks if that’s how they get their jollies (not that there’s any evidence that their fact checks have been incorrect so far, because there isn’t). On the other hand, Trump doesn’t have the same right, because he doesn’t own Twitter.com<p>2. Hate speech, and whether it is ever justified. Again, this doesn’t matter. Twitter has the right to remove (or visibly flag as the case may be) any post they want on their website, for any reason they want. They might do so because a post is hate speech, but they’d be just as firmly within their rights to do so for any other reason.<p>I think all of the confusion in these comments exists because the law is very simple, but many folks here don’t like the conclusion:<p>1. Twitter may fact check, flag, or remove the posts of Trump or any other user completely at their discretion, even if their fact checking turns out to be incorrect. Nothing about this violates Trump’s first amendment rights in any way.<p>2. I had hoped this was obvious, but in case it’s unclear to you, Trump and the US government absolutely do not have the power to shut down or punish Twitter in any way just because they don’t like the way that Twitter has fact checked Trump’s posts. This would in fact (obviously) violate Twitter’s first amendment rights.<p>Finally, there is no legal distinction between a “platform” and a “publisher” that in any way restricts the control that a business has over their own website.

Back then, all &quot;speech&quot; happens either live in person, or by individual printing presses. Government back then was the biggest threat to the concept of free speech, so it&#x27;s indoctrinated in the constitution as a legal concept.<p>Today, public discussion space has moved onto social media platforms. Government is no longer the biggest threat to speech (because of the Constitution), but private companies like Facebook, Twitter, Google, etc who can just ban anyone at will and cause them to lose the ability to reach their followers. If you want to protect free speech as a concept, then we need to update our legal concept to include any platform or service that&#x27;s identified as critical to public discussion.<p>Similar to how electricity companies are regulated as utilities companies because they&#x27;re so crucial to people&#x27;s daily lives, social media platforms should be regulated as speech platforms because they&#x27;re so crucial to today&#x27;s conversations happening in society.<p>This is the hard truth.

USA.), so it is not like this route seemed unnatural.<p>Even if the Europeans knew for certain that somebody had some sort of substantial counterintelligence on them, it would still take a long time to figure out the source of failure.

The web opened up to the public in 1993.  There was no commerce and marketing in the beginning.  Even by 1996 while commerce and marketing may have existed, e.g., Amazon founded in 1995, its place was in the background.  As I rememember the early web, the foreground, the &quot;starting point&quot; or &quot;portal&quot;, was something like Yahoo!  You had to pick a topic (direction) that you wanted to go in.  For example, if you were after music, you might end up browsing the Internet Underground Music Archive.  The &quot;front page&quot; of the portal was predominantly non-commercial, mostly generic headings for topics.  If you wanted to search out something commercial, no doubt you could but the initial starting point was <i>intellectual curiosity<\/i>.  This is IMO what has been lost over time with regard to web use: intellectual curiosity and the ability to actually satisfy it.  (A fun tangent here is the collections of inane queries that people type into Google.  These are simultaneously hilarious and disturbing.)<p>As an experiment have a look at the Yahoo! page today.  It is full of low quality mainstream &quot;news&quot;.  There is zero attention to intellectual curiosity.  Nothing to see here, folks, but here is the latest news.  For part 2 of the experiment, run a Google search for the term &quot;music&quot;.  The results are dominated by YouTube.  Every result is directly or indirectly commercial (either selling something or conducting surveillance and serving ads), except one: Wikipedia.  The chances of someone new to the web not following a link to YouTube or some other Google-controlled domain would seem almost nil.<p>The &quot;onboarding&quot; process for new web users is very different today than it was in the early 1990&#x27;s.  Perhaps it is still possible to approach the web with a sense of awe and wonder, pondering &quot;What is out there?&quot;  However a new web user is scant likely to end up on a non-commercial website besides Wikipedia.

So just as a little test, in the technical aspect of the rider, it would say “Article 148: There will be fifteen amperage voltage sockets at twenty-foot spaces, evenly, providing nineteen amperes …” This kind of thing.

Yes, we are more isolated, and perhaps concerned for the safety of ourselves or our loved ones, or even for some abstract concept of community or society, but depression is characterized by anhedonia: the inability to feel pleasure. Are we all sitting around, so preoccupied by the crises of the day that we have become numb to pleasure? That doesn&#x27;t describe depression, although perhaps anxiety. I would describe depression as the loss of most strong feelings, not only pleasurable ones, and that is why death becomes so alluring: fear of death has been numbed as well.<p>No, an existential crisis is rooted in the meaning, or lack thereof, we are able to ascribe to our lives.

Whatever stories we were telling ourselves about our life&#x27;s purpose, the plotlines we imagined for ourselves, have been disrupted. The student has had their university all but taken from them. They cannot experience it in quite the same tangible way as they once did. The same is true for the worker who derives his meaning from labor.

Mental health disorders are drastically under reported in the US, and due to various stigmas most people are unwilling to except mental health illnesses as actual illnesses until they are prepared to harm someone.<p>This is the number one problem most police officers deal with when engaging with the public. Many people have mental health disorders they are not aware of resulting in all manners of poor decisions and disorderly conduct. Some of these disorders are severe and demand medication and some are exaggerated by existing medications. I recommend talking with experienced police officers and listening to some of their war stories.<p>My sister-in-law is also a managing mental health counselor and says the number of undiagnosed mental health disorders could represent as much as 40% of the population.<p>In my own experience I find that people hide from this by frequently changing their social situation and environment through out the day, such as driving to an office. When you are stuck at home full time with nowhere to go suddenly coping and distraction mechanisms are gone which becomes clear to the coinhabitants. I am on my fifth military deployment so I have gone through this a few times, and you can readily see the people lacking of a regular rhythm of emotional stability and stress management. You are with these people all the time as you live, socialize, and work with them. On a military deployment you can’t rely on a frequent change of scenery to hide your insanity.<p>The most common example of excuse that people would hide behind pre-pandemic is finances. Bad financial situations are stressful, but stress is not a mental health disorder. Extreme stresses though often exacerbate pre-existing illnesses. In that regard bad finances don’t produce mental health disorders as frequently as suggested but instead exaggerate pre-existing conditions that become more clearly identifiable.<p>The difference between stress and a mental health disorder is something called <i>homeostasis<\/i>, which is the ability of the brain to return to a state of regular emotional equilibrium following an incidence of high stress. The military refers to the cognitive process of actively maintaining homeostasis as <i>resiliency<\/i> and it’s part of our annual training. The inability to return to resume functions of prior behavior following a major stressor is likely the result of a mental health illness.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.academia.edu&#x2F;4970988&#x2F;Mental_Health_DSM-V_mental_disorder_and_homeostasis_dream_sleep_and_day_time_interaction_of_cerebellum_and_cerebrum_in_the_regulation_of_behaviour_emotion_and_cognition\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.academia.edu&#x2F;4970988&#x2F;Mental_Health_DSM-V_mental_...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-27 22:56:16"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["amriksohata"],"id":[23320537],"kids":[23320728],"parent":[23319576],"text":["I strongly feel there is a link between modern foods and our gut&#x2F;brain axis that is causing a lot of this."],"time":["2020-05-27 09:55:11"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["eee_honda"],"id":[23331235],"kids":{},"parent":[23319576],"text":["no paywall:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.fo&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;health&#x2F;2020&#x2F;05&#x2F;26&#x2F;americans-with-depression-anxiety-pandemic&#x2F;?arc404=true\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.fo&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;health&#x2F;202...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-28 01:03:14"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["DyslexicAtheist"],"id":[23334706],"kids":{},"parent":[23319576],"text":["if you want to understand what&#x27;s going on zoom out and look at the last 200 years of civilization and society.

The topic of the news for the past two months now is that there&#x27;s a doom plague, a mask might not save you, people are violating quarantine to spread the plague, the economy is going to collapse, and Trump is making it all worse. People have lost their jobs, are being told they can&#x27;t work, that they must stay home, they must stay away from other people, they must be afraid, etc and so forth. So in light of that, it does not surprise me at all that depression and anxiety are ramping up in the adult population.<p>Neither does the breakdown by age surprise me, with it being worst amongst 18-29 year-olds, and declining with age. I would love to see a finer breakdown in that category. Here is my hypothesis:<p>For the youngest of adults, especially those just now entering adulthood or their professional careers, this is probably the first societal shock they&#x27;ve experienced. They did what they were supposed to according to The Plan of How The World Works. They persevered through the soul-crushing hell that is high school, and got the best grades they could, and applied for colleges, and are ready to become adults. Or maybe they didn&#x27;t get quite so good grades or dropped out and were banking on being able to support themselves with some kind of basic labor or service job. Or maybe they&#x27;ve taken out all the student loans to go to college, and are coming into what&#x27;s supposed to be the beginning of their professional career to an economy that&#x27;s about to collapse. Or if they haven&#x27;t graduated, now there&#x27;s the uncertainty if whether or nor they&#x27;ll be able to finish their degree, with there being question about when&#x2F;if campuses will open back up, or whether the online classes offered as substitutes will actually do any useful teaching. Regardless of the myriad variations available in the above, the basic situation remains the same: here they are, their life finally about to begin, and now the economy is collapsing, everyone&#x27;s dying, a fascist oompa loompa controls the government, and generally the world is over.  Well, shit. Now what?<p>I speak somewhat hyperbolically in describing the above, of course, but I stand by my basic point: The youngest adults are beginning their adulthood in fairly bad situation. And unless they&#x27;re old enough to remember the previous societal shocks that were supposed end the world, but didn&#x27;t, it&#x27;s all to easy to come near the despair event horizon or even cross it.<p>Compare those who are a little older, or hell, a lot older. They&#x27;ve seen the Housing Crisis, War, 9&#x2F;11, the dot-com bubble, and so on and so forth. And yet, they didn&#x27;t die and are still here. Odds are, at least one of the previous crises made their life worse for a time, or messed up what was supposed to be a bright future or golden opportunity. And yet, they didn&#x27;t die, and are still here. And the older they are, odds are, the more times they&#x27;ve seen that the world was about to end, and then didn&#x27;t. And the more likely they&#x27;ve internalized the lesson that in crises like these, how well they come out of it depends largely on their attitude and how they apply themselves to getting through it. And so we see that with the older and older age groups, the anxiety and depression numbers are lower and lower.<p>This post might sound a bit ranty, and like I am projecting, and I&#x27;d be lying if I tried to claim there weren&#x27;t threads of that woven through it. But it is not my intention for this to be just a &quot;toughen up you whippersnappers and get off my lawn!&quot; type post. No, if I had to have a message for the youngest of adults, it&#x27;s this: I get it. The world just got turned upside down an nobody knows what&#x27;s coming next. But, the future is not over, and things will get better.

Then they serve that and let the (modern) browser do the rest.<p>Really simply idea but effective.<p>1. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;lmatteis&#x2F;status&#x2F;1262126825427415044\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;lmatteis&#x2F;status&#x2F;1262126825427415044<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-28 10:12:09"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["m00dy"],"id":[23331932],"kids":[23332190],"parent":[23331099],"text":["What if a file depends on another file.
