It is definitely hard to keep a discussion on topic for more than a couple of hours without it becoming a generic social event, especially if there are late arrivals. Productivity of work meetings tends to approach zero after an hour; so why should it be different for book clubs? Denser books should require more discussion, but doing it in a single session is hard. The social aspect is fun and is a part of why I run the book club I do, but it is a competing priority with the book itself and different people in the club prioritize the two differently. The prioritization changes for everyone as time progresses and the amount of alcohol consumed increases.<p>Recommendation of having smaller meetings while the book is in progress deserves a trial. I will adopt it for the next book in my club. While we are holding these virtually, it seems that people are having easier time parceling an hour of their evening time so this will be practical.<p>There are a few things that differentiates my book club from the authors description of how a typical book club operates. Firstly, I select the book that I want to read and I think my friends will enjoy that is of appropriate time investment. This means there is no griping about book selection and having to competing desires of multiple people. Secondly there is a set schedule: 7:30pm on the first Monday of every other month at my apartment. This means there is no griping about choice of venue (an issue in NYC) and rescheduling to fit prior commitments the participants have. I make an announcement on Facebook and people have a choice to participate or not. This has been working out rather well with turns outs of somewhere between half a dozen to a dozen friends depending on the book.

This strikes me as odd. If you want a social gathering, why have the pretense of reading books, just organize the social gathering, perhaps a weekly meeting at the local pub or someone&#x27;s home. When I attend book clubs, it&#x27;s about the literary aspects of the book first and any social interaction is incidental, such as if I really like another person&#x27;s opinions, I&#x27;ll go chat with them afterwards. Indeed, I would be particularly annoyed if I spent time reading a book and went to discuss it, and all I got were people not talking about the book, either in depth or at least shallowly, and I&#x27;d find another book club.<p>In regards to the ongoing nature of book clubs, discussing every chapter, I think is is a great idea, and the best avenue I&#x27;ve seen it happen through is a medium like Reddit (or Tildes.net), with a nested forum post for each chapter that people can not only look back on now but in the future. Indeed, r&#x2F;bookclub and even other media related subreddits, like r&#x2F;anime or your favorite TV show like r&#x2F;gameofthrones, have such weekly threads for reading or rewatching the requisite media. This feels to me the best way to accomplish the author&#x27;s goals. Of course, there is no real social interaction, but again, if you want social interaction, go to a social event that is explicitly (or sufficiently implicitly) stated that it is for socialization, such as a pub gathering.

A relatively recent (past ~20k years) migration from Central Siberia correlated with the Ancestral North Eurasians [1], who contributed significant ancestry to Amerindians, Europeans, and Central&#x2F;South Asians. They were phenotypically intermediate between modern East and West Eurasians, hence the unique combination of features often found in Amerindians.<p>2. A remnant of a much earlier (~50k years) population descended from humans who took the Southern Route [2] across Eurasia. They contributed significant ancestry to the Australian Aboriginals, certain South and Southeast Asian populations, and potentially some groups in the Amazon. The ancestry contributed to those Amerindians in the Amazon would&#x27;ve had to come from this population coming up across East Eurasia, where they could&#x27;ve left behind (or contributed to) populations like the Ainu.<p>West Eurasians (Caucasoids) and South Eurasians (Australoids) share a few distinctive traits that are shared by the Ainu, notably prominent brow ridges, lack of epicanthic folds, and heavier facial hair. So purely from a phenotypic point of view it&#x27;s difficult to determine their origin.

For context, I&#x27;m a late-year PhD student in machine learning theory, and I submit almost entirely to conferences, which is the norm in my field.<p>To me, the big problem is that there is little incentive for experts to review papers. I write a few papers every year, and I review 5x that number. Slightly more senior people -- postdocs and junior faculty -- may review more like 30-40 papers. Most papers I review are not good papers. This is especially true at the big machine learning conferences like NeurIPS, ICML, and ICLR, where a disconcertingly large fraction (1&#x2F;3?) of submissions are outright bad. Most of them are at best &quot;meh&quot;. So there&#x27;s not much benefit to the reviewer beyond some notion of community service.<p>I think my ~colleagues (PhD students, postdocs, young faculty)  have similar opinions. We&#x27;ve certainly discussed these issues in the past. One positive step NeurIPS has taken is giving &quot;best reviewer&quot; awards that come from with a free registration. That&#x27;s a nice benefit, even if it won&#x27;t on its own incentivize good reviews. Some people have suggested outright paying people for reviews at some quasi-competitive rate, maybe $100 per review (note that this is not great -- a good review takes at least several hours if the paper is not terrible). NeurIPS also added a requirement this year that all submitting authors must review, which is an interesting experiment.<p>My impractical wish is that we also have some kind of &quot;worst reviewer&quot; sticker for all the reviewers who just paraphrase the abstract, add some milquetoast feelings on novelty, and weak reject. Less facetiously, some kind of StackOverflow reputation system might be useful. As is there&#x27;s so little external signal about being a good or bad reviewer that the incentives are pretty wrong. Some kind of points system might help.<p>But my overall point might be: reviewers by and large aren&#x27;t malicious, jealous people who are only rejecting your work because they want to protect their own turf. They are more likely good faith actors who are trying to balance time spent on a pretty thankless but societally useful job (reviewing) with time spent on much more personally enjoyable and rewarding activities (research, family, hobbies, etc).

Journalists should responsibly cover preprint studies, but frankly most don&#x27;t, and who can blame them when even the scientific community is struggling to review the papers itself.<p>I volunteer with a group[0] that&#x27;s trying to address this problem in a small way by creating visual summaries&#x2F;reviews of popular preprints for mainstream readers. This is a side project, so the review process is just a shared Google doc for each paper, but what I&#x27;d like to see:<p>As a reviewer:<p><pre><code>  * View diffs between paper revisions\n  * Comment on papers inline, like a pull request\n  * +1&#x2F;-1 a submission, or just leave questions without a decision\n  * Gain &quot;karma&quot; for good reviews to build my reputation in the community (like Stack OverFlow)\n<\/code><\/pre>\nAs a paper author:<p><pre><code>  * Reply to comments to understand and explain context\n  * Post revisions\n<\/code><\/pre>\nAs a reader:<p><pre><code>  * See visual summaries of papers, with inlined reviews (like Research Explained)\n  * Vote on both studies and reviews to surface the good ones\n  * Browse profiles of authors and reviewers to understand their qualifications&#x2F;contributions\n<\/code><\/pre>\nI do think <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;distill.pub\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;distill.pub<\/a> is on the right track. Their papers are significantly more visual&#x2F;readable than most, and they require contributors to open a pull request against the distill repo.

I remember freezing my ass standing at the bus stop every morning to get to school, and being a dumb kid, I thought that was &quot;normal&quot;, as in, I didn&#x27;t know that you can have warmer jackets or clothes to stay warm.<p>Growing up in Nashville (K-12), I literally believed people of my skin color and origin were actually inferior to white people. The South can be hospitable, and I don&#x27;t mean to generalize. Regardless, the folks who don&#x27;t want to welcome you are very clear about that and have the loudest voices. One of my best friends in high school wasn&#x27;t allowed to come over my house. I certainly won&#x27;t accept my children having to deal with that non-sense. In grade school and middle school, I was bullied often and being the only non-white and non-black kid, it was sort of like being treated as a pariah.<p>This was all back in the 90&#x27;s to 2000&#x27;s. I don&#x27;t mind living in the West coast, and I think my current city is amazing except that housing is extremely expensive.<p>Nashville and the surrounding areas are a beautiful place. I assume they&#x27;ve become more progressive in the past 25 years, but I don&#x27;t know.

So seems owning land somewhere could be beneficial... Full time RVing seems to have it&#x27;s pros and cons, but I think maybe part time RVing would be a little less stressful.<p>Also if you lived somewhere with cold winters, maybe RV a bit in the warmer months for a month or two then during the winter head off to Arizona or something... Like I think Utah would be a cool place to vacation in the summers since a lot of beautiful places to visit like Zion, go off-roading, mountains, etc... But probably not the first choice to live year around since I&#x27;d love to escape cold depressing winters but if I did could use the RV to do a bit of snowbirding to like AZ, TX or FL. Otherwise I think Utah is a near prefect state as an outsider prospective in general and sounds like in the future they might attract more tech but if more and more companies go remote then moving to an area based on jobs but other things in life you care about is a bonus, and might even make other places compete more for gaining more residents who are looking to find a new home town.<p>I think snow is pretty but haven&#x27;t had much snow lately just cold and after a while it gets old quick...  Always wanted to try snowboarding too. There&#x27;s someone from Utah I  like, so that kinda makes me change my mind a bit, and seen that Salt Lake City is on some list for startup hubs haha but I don&#x27;t think they are as successful as say maybe Austin, Texas is at this point.<p>I kinda want something different, since bored of where I&#x27;m from and not as much opportunities as I&#x27;d hoped, seems to be a problem in the midwest in general and people call it the brain drain problem. Like there&#x27;s a company in Philadelphia I&#x27;m a fan of and thought of relocating since they even offer a bonus but seems almost the same stuff just another state over...<p>If you could get decent internet, working from cruise ships sounds interesting too! But I think being a nomad and working a regular 9 to 5 job online wouldn&#x27;t be enjoyable and hard to balance work and play... That might work better if you manage your own company remotely or some other passive sources.

This one has been discussed on HN before - its where I found it. I completed it last year (from Jan to May 2019) and ended up with Lisp-a-like interpreter written in C# that is sophisticated enough to self-host (i.e. it can interpret and run itself). I picked it up again when the lockdown started and I am now using it to re-implement some of the classic AI systems described in Paradigms of AI Programming [1]. I almost have Eliza (the first chatbot, from 1966!) running, which has necessitated some thinking because MAL is closer to Clojure than the Common Lisp used in PAIP. I&#x27;m also implementing what is in effect a standard library of useful MAL functions.<p>What I got from MAL was much better knowledge of C#, better insights into the power of lisp-like languages, some intense satisfaction when I managed some of the more complex stages, etc. MAL is progressive, supported by 100s of tests, and an amazing array of reference implementations in a huge number of different programming languages.<p>[Edit] My side-project before MAL involved downloading the Unity game engine and using it to explore the different aspects of game development. I discovered that I really enjoyed asset creation and in particular lighting and shader design, and (long story short - totally bizarre trajectory) ended up creating a tutorial for the Octane render engine that has had actual sales!

The needs of parties are very different than meetings.  I&#x27;d suggest there be a central channel where everyone can participate and talk, with the video on that channel being something that sets the theme of the party (a bonfire, a movie, a performance).  Then it should be extremely easy to click on participants and engage one or a few in conversation.  Perhaps those side video conversations  could bleed into the main channel (maybe audio only) so that people in the main channel can overhear and potentially decide to join in.  Think about how people interact at parties and try to tailor video conferencing to work better for social gatherings.  Security should be built in to reduce worries about privacy so people feel free to talk; no routing of everything through a central server, peer to peer only; recording should be only by consent (though there would be no way to stop analog recordings).  There are a variety of video streaming libraries that might make building such an app easy.  It should be trivially easy to understand and use.  I think it might almost be possible to use existing teleconferencing apps if everyone could join two channels, the main channel and a side channel, using two devices, e.g., a laptop for the main channel shared by several people, and individual phones for the side channel for smaller conversations.  Coordinating all that and explaining to people how it works might be difficult though, so putting it all into one app with an intuitive UI would be useful.  There may be issues such as how to deal with audio feedback noise and easily joining and leaving side conversations though.  You don&#x27;t want people to have to send invites and accept them to set up a side conversation, you want it to be instant and easy.<p>Even if the coronavirus ended tomorrow, I think this would be a popular and widely used application."],"time":["2020-05-24 17:25:48"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["canada_dry"],"id":[23294355],"kids":{},"parent":[23290536],"text":["Perhaps you could develop an open-source self-hosted tool for neighbours, communities and groups to connect, share info and support each other during quarantine.<p>I posted this a while ago and it never received attention:  <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22604275\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22604275<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-24 22:17:25"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["langitbiru"],"id":[23291450],"kids":{},"parent":[23290536],"text":["Create cross platform GUI library for Rust programming language.

Also, please let me know any suggestions that you might have that could make this better. Thanks a lot!<p>P.S.: Also, I&#x27;m thinking about removing domains that were purchased from the &quot;most popular&quot; and &quot;recently viewed&quot; sections - should I do that or should I leave them there?

Their products are, bar none, the best in the industry. I&#x27;d estimate that their direct competition will never catch up. They&#x27;re so easy to use and maintain, I would assert that if you can install a web browser and check your email, you could run a Synology NAS. And the prices don&#x27;t even have much of a surcharge over DIY (maybe 30%? you could DIY a server for pretty cheap with hand-me-down enterprise hardware, so hard to compare, but Synology&#x27;s prices are very fair).<p>Let me outline a few things Synology does that makes your life so much easier:<p>- All of the administration happens through a web portal. And its not a basic, geeky portal. Its literally a full desktop. They&#x27;ve implemented windowing, minimizing&#x2F;maximizing, desktop shortcuts, a start menu, it feels like a literal desktop running in your web browser. Just YouTube some videos of &quot;Diskstation Manager&quot;.<p>- But, its also just Linux. You can SSH into it. It supports everything Linux does.<p>- They don&#x27;t use ZFS or mdadm; they&#x27;ve implemented their own raid system they call &quot;synology hybrid raid&quot; (SHR). It supports surprisingly smart heterogenous drive size utilization while still maintaining N-Drive redundancy; with, for example, a 2TB+4TB+6TB+8TB drive combination in SHR-1 (RAID-5 equivalent), only 2TB of drive storage is totally unused (12TB storage + 6TB redundancy). Traditional RAID-5 would leave 12TB unused [1]. They put btrfs on top of it, so its not totally custom.<p>- When a drive goes bad, the physical unit starts beeping at you. No configuration necessary. You can see which drive is dead via the LEDs on the front, swap it out without turning the unit off, and a rebuild begins; you don&#x27;t even have to visit the amazing Admin UI if you don&#x27;t want to. You can also have it email you if you want, which is far easier than setting up an email notification on a bare linux server.<p>- It has an app store. A server app store! Want Plex? One click and you&#x27;re online. Want Minecraft? Done. Want backups? Their &quot;hyper backup&quot; software supports a dozen targets including another Synology NAS, their own cloud storage, Google Drive, S3, Azure, SFTP, RSync, a USB drive, Dropbox, bunch of other stuff, it supports encrypted backups, it supports incremental backups. Want dynamic dns? Built in, with multiple providers including Synology&#x27;s own, no cost. Wordpress? One click. MariaDB? One click. Email server? Done. MediaWiki? LDAP? OAuth IDP? Easy. All of this is as simple as installing a web browser. Actually, its simpler.<p>- Want to share external links with friends, like Google Drive? Synology Drive. It has a document and spreadsheet editor, totally custom, and probably 70% as good as Google Drive (which is pretty impressive considering you&#x27;ve never heard about it). If you have internet which isn&#x27;t NAT&#x27;ed in a way that blocks hosting a server, it&#x27;ll work. Generate a public link. Send it. Done.<p>Synology is awesome. If you thought self-hosting a server was too hard, think again. Anyone can do this. The unit sitting under my TV has an uptime of three years (I do have a UPS that can power it for about an hour or two; this has been used many times). I literally cannot express how little I&#x27;ve touched it in that time. I maintain all of our company&#x27;s production cloud workloads on AWS, and I&#x27;d feel comfortable moving some things to a Synology unit, if you can develop a better story around redundant networking and power (this is the real challenge with self-hosting; not the server itself, not data redundancy, but the pipes supplying it).<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.synology.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;support&#x2F;RAID_calculator\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.synology.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;support&#x2F;RAID_calculator<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-24 17:09:05"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[23295482],"kids":{},"parent":[23290953],"text":{},"time":["2020-05-25 00:32:44"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":["danShumway"],"id":[23292722],"kids":[23292909,23295243,23296272,23292729],"parent":[23290953],"text":["General question for anyone who feels opinionated: should I be avoiding BTRFS in software Raids?<p>My understanding is that ZFS forces you to be a lot less flexible with which size drives you put into the array, which is what attracted me towards BTRFS in the first place.

There are plenty of reasons for doing RAID6+hotspares+replication (and a ton of other fancy choices), but RAID5 nails 99% of the use&#x2F;problem cases in my book when managed properly. Trust me here, i&#x27;ve seen plenty of raid5 failures... :)<p>RAID5 is one of the best trade-offs in price&#x2F;perf&#x2F;availability you can make. Just about no one runs RAID+ on their desktop&#x2F;laptop because the core storage technology is considered reliable enough that catastrophic failures are rare. Instead good backup hygiene is practiced.<p>For most use cases RAID5 adds a couple digits to your reliability&#x2F;availability. When properly cared for (scrubbed and smart monitored) the most exciting thing that will happen is you will drop a drive every few ten thousand drive hours, and swapping a replacement in within a day or two, everything will be fine.<p>The cases that manage to take out a well managed RAID5 array, will likely take out just about any other mechanism as well. Having RAID6, RAID10, ZFS or whatever adds additional complexity and won&#x27;t take care of firmware bugs on the disks, a batch of disks that all blow the bearings within a couple hours of each other, something going horribly wrong with the SATA&#x2F;SAS controller&#x2F;expander (think voltage spikes, chassis fires (well i&#x27;ve seen just about everything!)), viruses or bad filesystem bugs. The latter is  scary high, a lot higher than most people think, and one of the reasons i&#x27;m skeptical of ZFS&#x2F;BTRFS&#x2F;etc.<p>But of course, just like your laptop&#x2F;desktop you need a solid backup&#x2F;recovery plan, hopefully offsite, multiply redundant and with a reasonable recovery speed. So I strongly encourage everyone to invest and maximize your backup story before you go beyond raid5.<p>Now, there are certain kinds of super critical data, and for those there are fancier solutions (remote replication&#x2F;etc), but those solutions overwhelmingly aren&#x27;t as robust as you imagine. Its the old &quot;a plane with two engines has twice as many engine failures&quot; mantra. The more layers of fancy filesystem, replication, deduplicatin, encryption, T10 checksuming, etc you add, the more places that can fail. Which is why you shouldn&#x27;t even be thinking about them until you have a multivendor offsite (including offline) backup story that can meet you TOS numbers for recovery. It will take exactly 1 building fire to wipe out all that fancy hardware&#x2F;sofeware, or at least take it offline for days. The last thing you want is the dying breath of your local storage stack to tell the remote one &quot;ok wipe everything&quot; or &quot;here is write for XXXXXXXX sectors.....&quot; and trash a big chunk of the remote replicant.<p>Bottom line, RAID5 provides a fair amount of additional assurance against generally unlikely single drive failures. Nothing you can do on a single array&#x2F;filessytem will save you from all those other bad things that can happen, so backup, backup backup!!!!"],"time":["2020-05-26 07:33:02"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mrjin"],"id":[23300504],"kids":[23307532],"parent":[23290953],"text":["I&#x27;ve read through the article and it turns out to me that he wrote it to show he was lucky enough not to experience a multi-disk RAID failure. Personally I owned dozens of HDDs across almost all brands from desktop&#x2F;laptop HDDS to Enterprise HDDs or NAS HDDs and almost half of them had bad sectors with a life span of a couple of months to a few years, some of which even broke in a row in a few days. The only exception is that in my last batch of 5 Seagate NAS drives, there was no single failure after around 4 years and I think I&#x27;m just been lucky with those as I did hear quite a few people were complaining about the same model.<p>Due to the nature of how HDD works, the surfaces of the disks have more or less defects leaving the factory and were graded by the count of defects, and even the enterprise grade one are not free of defects. Those defects and adjacent areas then are masked by the firmware so that magnetic heads won&#x27;t trying to read&#x2F;write to&#x2F;from them. But that won&#x27;t prevent them from growing. The factories are very clean but the dusts in the air are simply impossible to avoid and if one lands on the disk, it&#x27;s a time bomb. Also as the disks&#x27; capacity grows, the tracks get narrower and narrower. The disks spins from 5400 rpm to 15000 rpm maybe even faster and the magnetic heads are gliding micros from the disk and if the heads touch the disk surface, it almost for sure to create a bad sector event bad tracks. And again, the vibrations are impossible to avoid. Making it even worse, the contact are almost guaranteed to generate debris to be scattered to the whole disk, event goes to other disks sealed in the same case. The bigger capacity, the narrower the track will be, the less tolerant to such contact. Based on the fact, I really don&#x27;t see where he got the confidence the disks people bought were not going to have bad sectors during their expected life span.<p>Also the disks people use to build the RAID are most likely the same brand, the same model and the same batch and thus if one started to have bad sectors, most likely the others are going to have them soon or even worse may already have them. Even if the other disks in the array do not have bad sectors at the time of the failure, they are highly likely going to have during the rebuilding process, why? The load. Take a 10TB drive as an example, my Seagate 10 NAS drive can deliver ~180MB&#x2F;s peak writing and ~80MB&#x2F;s at the trough. Let&#x27;s assume it can deliver 100MB&#x2F;s all the way, and the disk is half full it will almost take 14 hours to finish, this load is highly likely to push other drives to the limit. For RAID6 allows another 1 to fail. For RAID5, if another drive failed during rebuilding, you data is gone. If you had to rebuild a 12 bays NAS, you would know how frustrating it could be, especially when there were secondary failures.<p>Software RAID may somehow alleviate the problem a little bit but it will also cover up the issue. My experience was that once there is one single bad sector, there will be lots of them soon, if you don&#x27;t back up the data and replace the faulty drive on spot, most likely it will be too late.<p>All above does not event consider the setup and quirks of NAS or RAID cards. Put all those issue aside, what&#x27;s are the benefits of RAID for home users? IMO, almost NIL. Our home network device most likely are Gigabyte ones with 1 Gbps ports, which can only deliver about 100MB&#x2F;s, you can see that a single drive can almost saturate that bandwidth even with link aggregation. And most people does not need the random IO boost or extra large volumes come with RAID.<p>My suggestion for home users is to go single drive and stay away from RAID."],"time":["2020-05-25 14:59:49"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["akkawwakka"],"id":[23290284],"kids":[23290617,23290776,23291749],"parent":[23289939],"text":["The pathology of COVID-19 is really interesting.

When a key was depressed, an interposer, beneath the keylever, was pushed down into a slotted tube full of small metal balls (called the &quot;compensator tube&quot;) and spring latched. These balls were adjusted to have enough horizontal space for only one interposer to enter at a time. (Mechanisms much like this were used in keyboards for teleprinters before World War II.) If a typist pressed two keys simultaneously both interposers were blocked from entering the tube. Pressing two keys several milliseconds apart allows the first interposer to enter the tube, tripping a clutch which rotated a fluted shaft driving the interposer horizontally and out of the tube. The powered horizontal motion of the interposer selected the appropriate rotate and tilt of the printhead for character selection, but also made way for the second interposer to enter the tube some milliseconds later, well before the first character had been printed. While a full print cycle was 65 milliseconds this filtering and storage feature allowed the typist to depress keys in a more random fashion and still print the characters in the sequence entered.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;IBM_Selectric_typewriter\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;IBM_Selectric_typewriter<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-24 20:07:45"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jaclaz"],"id":[23271237],"kids":[23294130],"parent":[23270785],"text":["The sad thing is that I actually vaguely remember them in the office and that earlier, as a kid, few things were cooler than the TV UFO series:<p>SHADO<p>SUPREME HEADQUARTERS ......<p>ALIEN DEFENCE ORGANIZATION ...<p>SECRET LOCATION ....

The problem is that we aren&#x27;t even trying to train ourselves out of it. Without a practiced ability to recognize when we&#x27;re being led through a nice-sounding story, anyone who can weave a good tale will capture huge numbers of people through the internet for their own purposes. For examples, see flat-earthers, anti-vaxxers, and the various political disinformation campaigns.<p>I don&#x27;t know what the solution is. But I worry a lot about the ability of powerful interests to capture more power when the general populace is in chaos. Early 21st century USA is in a state of intense intellectual chaos, and the increasing pace of capital accumulation at the top of our society is an ill omen."],"time":["2020-05-24 21:12:44"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["bryanrasmussen"],"id":[23293606],"kids":[23293660,23293715,23293709,23293921,23293890],"parent":[23293462],"text":["I guess I&#x27;d handle it by asking what proof there was that humans are biologically inclined to commit this fallacy.<p>on edit: I mean biologically inclined implies some genomic proof.

This means restaurants essentially have to be on them to compete. Before, more decentralized factors like geography and word-of-mouth helped restaurants gain and hold marketshare.<p>This isn’t a new phenomenon, but it’s a definite shakeup of an industry that didn’t have to deal with this issue as much before. It’s similar to how credit card networks like Visa and Mastercard inserted themselves into the payments space. The ease of use these services offered customers simply outweigh the option for sellers to not use them. Sellers already didn’t like how these companies skimmed a few percent off of every purchase. Now you have delivery apps which are taking far more significant chunks of revenue out of each transaction.<p>However, how many customers know how much of what they’re paying is going to transaction costs? Some stores and gas stations offer slightly lower prices if you pay with cash instead of card. Customers are given this awareness so they understand that they are paying more for a feature.<p>Takeout apps not only add to the transaction cost, but also control the interface between the customer and restaurant. A restaurant wouldn’t even have the option to tell the customer how much of the price of their food goes toward middleman fees because it’s not in the takeout services’ interests to surface that info in their app. Instead, they can hide away the details of price differences between restaurants and then play sellers off against each other for their own benefit. Even credit card networks don’t have that much control over the entire transaction process, but these new end-to-end marketplaces control both factors in order to pawn off blame on the sellers.<p>If this continues, I foresee these takeout services exerting so much control over small-business restaurants that the restaurants either fold or all be homogenized under whatever the takeout services will. Given the propensity for vertical integration these days, the takeout services will probably just stand up their own food services in place of the restaurants, similar to what Uber ultimately wants to do with its drivers. Small business won’t be able to compete and even more local restaurants will disappear. Some will continue to exist as a niche as demand for variety&#x2F;personable service and low prices&#x2F;convenience fluctuate back and forth between stabilizing somewhere in the middle. This will probably be at the expense of customers and society as a whole, given that restaurants are one of the last bastions of small business in the ever globalizing economy.<p>In order to combat the shock that restaurants face while takeout apps hold a huge level of control over the marketplace, public institutions and personal will are needed to keep these apps from becoming too powerful. I see it as a more proactive form of anti-trust enforcement. Otherwise, you’re looking at a future where local restaurants probably won’t exist."],"time":["2020-05-24 17:19:44"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[23291431],"kids":{},"parent":[23291170],"text":{},"time":["2020-05-24 15:40:16"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":["SpicyLemonZest"],"id":[23291470],"kids":[23291505],"parent":[23291170],"text":["While I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m on board with it, I have to admit that it&#x27;s impressive how much restaurants have managed to moralize their pricing disputes with delivery apps.

The fees are pretty obscene, and it&#x27;s clear that apps like GrubHub pass that cost to the restaurant rather than the customer because they know that the customer won&#x27;t want to pay that much and that restaurants at least want some amount of attention and visibility in these apps, especially since more customers are wanting to use these apps rather than ordering through some crappy website or by calling in.<p>But I&#x27;m not convinced that apps actually <i>should<\/i> require the amount of overhead they might try and claim is responsible for these high fees.  Customer and driver support for delivery apps is pretty minimal and almost always outsourced.  Nowadays, most driver support is handled via text, which means you can have fewer support staff and they can just multitask.  When I drove for GrubHub, when I visited the regional office, it was usually staffed by one or two people who were only there maybe a few hours out of the day(which is why, at least a few years ago, you couldn&#x27;t just randomly show up).  It&#x27;s possible that they have way more employees at their HQ... but I have to wonder just how much of their costs are essential and not fluff generated by excessive growth from VC funding.  Why bother building a lean organization if the money will just keep coming in whether or not the business model brings in enough money?  All it has to do is bring in <i>enough<\/i> money to make lenders confident in the future of the business.<p>In any case, there seems to be room for a delivery app, or a <i>system<\/i> of delivery apps, to compete with top-heavy companies like GrubHub and DoorDash.  Why not run a leaner delivery app business, charge restaurants a flat fee, don&#x27;t bother with a big marketing department because partnered restaurants will do most of the marketing by visibility, have restaurants pay the base delivery fee, allow drivers to keep all their tips to encourage more drivers, and pass the $3-4 deliver fee to the customer?  Say you charged partnered restaurants $199 a month, and you acquired the market share of GrubHub, which is ~115,000 restaurants; that would be $22,885,000 per months of revenue.
