Changing these could make an enormous difference in bringing new ideas and different perspectives to the Pentagon. Making pay more competitive would be great, too, but that is not the primary problem. Many will exchange a certain amount of compensation for a chance to work on vitally important matters and to serve their country, if only the system encouraged their recruitment.<p>The clearance process takes so long that hiring someone without a clearance usually results in a months-long (could be over a year) wait before they can actually start their job.

Finance needs a platform. Right now, there are a myriad of broken, old, difficult to upgrade systems that prevent basically any significant innovation from taking place in the payment transfer landscape. This has been commented on a lot. But I think it&#x27;s important to step back a bit and understand <i>why<\/i> that is.<p>Finance is dominated by extremely large, extremely risk averse institutions, that all compete with one another. Any one of them certainly has the resources to develop &quot;the app store&quot; for finance, but the problem is that all the other ones are incentivized not to adopt it. JPMorgan doesn&#x27;t want BofA to own the app store for finance, and so they will never integrate with it.<p>This is, fundamentally, a tragedy of the commons. All these big institutions, and all of us customers would benefit from some unified, universal financial platform. But nobody can build it, because every actor in a position to doesn&#x27;t want to accept anyone else owning such an important choke point.<p>So what happens? Well, we get standards imposed by the only actor in the space powerful enough to create something like this: governments. Governments are, in general, not great at this sort of thing, and they certainly aren&#x27;t very fast moving, or responsive to consumer demand.<p><i>This<\/i>, is the problem that blockchain solves. We all know that anything you can do on Ethereum you can do in a relational database 1000x more efficiently and better. Better in every way except one: Ownership. Any traditional relational database is going to be <i>owned by someone<\/i>. Public blockchains are owned by no-one. JPMorgan can build applications on top of Ethereum or Bitcoin, not because they need its technical capabilities, but because Bank of America doesn&#x27;t own it.<p>This is the critical insight to understanding why this stuff is important and valuable. It solves the coordination problem imposed by platforms. Platforms have tremendous value to users and efficiency, but they confer far too much power upon their owner for any financial institution to use a platform owned by another. The ability to make a &#x27;financial commons&#x27; that is not owned by any one institution, government, or entity is what makes this technology powerful and useful."],"time":["2020-08-23 07:52:44"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["valenciarose"],"id":[24264143],"kids":{},"parent":[24249477],"text":["Every jurisdiction regulates financial institutions for good reasons (yes, also some bad reasons).

Everybody can maintain it&#x27;s own, independent mail service, but everybody can still communicate with each other. On the other hand there are very few messaging services that are totally incompatible to each other. Depending on where you live, you might only use iMessage, Whatsapp or WeChat. Even tough it may be technically possible to use other services like Signal or Threema, you are most definitively going to experience a lot inconveniences.

Therefore, by means of such experiments he ascertained that the weights by which all tones on equal strings .. were reciprocally as the squares of the lengths of the string by which the musical instrument emits the same tones. But the proportion discovered by these experiments, on the evidence of Macrobius, he applied to the heavens and consequently by comparing those weights with the weights of the Planets and the lengths of the strings with the distances of the Planets, he understood by means of the harmony of the heavens that the weights of the Planets towards the Sun were reciprocally as the squares of their distances from the Sun.&quot;<p>This article has more:\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;royalsocietypublishing.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;10.1098\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;royalsocietypublishing.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;10.1098<\/a>"],"time":["2020-08-23 16:57:10"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["growlist"],"id":[24238691],"kids":[24245596,24243104],"parent":[24233820],"text":["Pages 43 and 44!<p>Although by some accounts Newton could be pretty nasty, a quick look at this almost makes me feel sorry for him given the advancement of his mind versus the state of knowledge at the time.

Anything that is &quot;something else&quot; should at the very least be questioned. Questions 10x if the party doing &quot;something else&quot; is trying to <i>encourage<\/i> information asymmetry as part of this. e.g. Apple telling app developers that not only can they not integrate another payment option in their apps, they can&#x27;t even <i>inform<\/i> users that such an option exists elsewhere.<p>Arguably the main issue in this case is that Apple is not just requiring themselves to be the payment gateway in transactions where they are involved (getting an app onto your device), they also want to insert themselves into transactions where they provide no value (e.g. subscriptions). In the case of my Spotify subscription, Apple is not paying for bandwidth, payment processing costs, or anything else, but they still get a cut.<p>If you&#x27;re capturing value from a transaction you&#x27;re not directly involved in, I think that&#x27;s a problem. Apple&#x27;s argument is that they are enabling such things by building the device&#x2F;operating system, and historically that has been a valid argument, but I think we&#x27;ve come to the point where that just isn&#x27;t enough anymore.

Instead, OpenAI put us off indefinitely despite repeated requests—even as it made access widely available to the media... OpenAI’s striking lack of openness seems to us to be a serious breach of scientific ethics, and a distortion of the goals of the associated nonprofit. Its decision forced us to limit our testing to a comparatively small number of examples, giving us less time to investigate than we would have liked, which means there may be more serious problems that we didn’t have a chance to discern.”<\/i><p>Several other researchers I know — <i>very<\/i> good researchers who happen to have been publicly critical of GPT-2 — have not been given access.<p>This isn’t how science is done (access for reproducibility and probing, but selectively and excluding prominent critics).

My primary account has 3000 rooms and about 450K visible users - on element-web this uses 1.1GB of RAM, but on hydrogen it uses 14MB :)  We’re also looking at glueing E2EE into Hydrogen via the crypto layer of matrix-rust-sdk, which could be a massive win in terms of reusing and auditing a robust safe implementation for the Hard problem of encryption, rather than implementing it from scratch every time in every new client.<p>Dendrite (go server impl) progress is also very promising - we’ve been focusing on it (at last!) since the beginning of the year, and going to enter beta in the next few weeks. A typical small&#x2F;medium live server is currently using 57MB of RAM (rather than synapse’s ~500MB). We haven’t started optimising yet :)<p>Synapse has also finally come of age - the whole codebase has almost been switched to twisted&#x2F;asyncio rather than twisted deferreds, which both speeds things up a bit but also gives us way better visibility on profiling for future perf work. Almost all bits now scale horizontally (apart from the master dispatcher process). Synapse isn’t going away - we see Synapse and Dendrite coexisting much as Apache and nginx coexist today.<p>Conduit is also super exciting as an entirely community developed Rust homeserver, which currently runs ~10x faster than either Synapse or Dendrite (but doesn’t federate yet, or scale horizontally). It’s really fun to see an indie FOSS server implementation properly take off :)<p>Finally, P2P Matrix is coming together well - compiling Dendrite to WASM and running it clientside, using Yggdrasil currently as an overlay network to tunnel through to other P2P nodes.<p>In short: the Matrix ecosystem is in a fairly healthy place right now - the next gen of clients and servers should be incredible :)"],"time":["2020-08-22 11:03:42"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["siraben"],"id":[24241441],"kids":[24242961,24243861],"parent":[24239564],"text":["Matrix is great for bridging[0] between different chat applications.

Humans can accurately transcribe a <i>printed<\/i> text without knowing the language. They do that with a mental model of font metrics and so on. In fact, a human transcribes more accurately (though more slowly) when they don&#x27;t know the language because they don&#x27;t erroneously &quot;autocorrect&quot;.<p>I wonder if Google has in-house OCR that works much better than commercially available OCR. Google has OCR-ed at least 25 million books. You can&#x27;t download the complete texts, but you can see snippets.

One party is effectively utilizing this to obtain, maintain and increase their hold on govt positions.<p>&gt; None of this is a coincidence. Republicans responded to the election of Barack Obama in 2008 not by trying to broaden their own base or appeal to a changing nation, but by modernizing voter suppression tactics out of the old Jim Crow playbook.\nChief Justice John Roberts’s shameful 5-4 decision in 2013’s Shelby County v Holder ripped the heart out of the prime enforcement mechanism of the Voting Rights Act. Roberts argued that the South had changed, and such protections were no longer necessary. 1965, Roberts suggested, was a long time ago, in a different nation, across a changed South. The tens of thousands of Georgians whose voting precincts were closed, forcing them to endure six-hour lines to vote during a pandemic would like a word with him Roberts’s calamitous ignorance has done grievous damage.<p>&quot;Crosscheck&quot; app&#x2F;system which is frequently run against democratic counties was found to have a 200 to 1 false positive to true negative rate. It&#x27;s still being heavily pushed.<p>&gt; Crosscheck is a national database designed to check for voters who are registered in more than one state by comparing names and dates of birth. Researchers at Stanford University, the University of Pennsylvania, Harvard University, and Microsoft found that for every legitimate instance of double registration it finds, Crosscheck&#x27;s algorithm returns approximately 200 false positives.[108] Kobach has been repeatedly sued by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and other civil rights organizations for trying to restrict voting rights in Kansas.<p>&gt; Often, voter fraud is cited as a justification for such measures, even when the incidence of voter fraud is low. In Iowa, lawmakers passed a strict voter ID law with the potential to disenfranchise 260,000 voters. Out of 1.6 million votes cast in Iowa in 2016, there were only 10 allegations of voter fraud; none were cases of impersonation that a voter ID law could have prevented. Only one person, a Republican voter, was convicted. Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate, the architect of the bill, admitted, &quot;We&#x27;ve not experienced widespread voter fraud in Iowa.&quot;<p>We&#x27;re reaching a very concerning threshold of election integrity that is being under appreciated.

Choosing the angle of emphasising a (fairly recent in origin) connection to a maligned fringe group. Great way to taint a theory and practice that is not the current paradigm, and implicitly associating anyone who takes an interest in it with a community of people few want to be associated with<p>2. “Many self-identified incels have a highly mechanistic understanding of human relationships and believe they can improve their station in the sexual hierarchy through a practice called ‘looksmaxxing’: enhancing one’s sex appeal through weight lifting, skin and hair treatments, and even plastic surgery” – Try replacing ‘self-identified incels’ with ‘self-identified women’. Hardly controversial that getting in shape and grooming oneself increases one’s chances of finding a romantic partner, even if might be neither sufficient nor necessary.<p>3. “I already knew how I felt about some of the Mews’ claims – John’s absurd belief, for instance, that unattractive criminals are less likely to reoffend if their faces are made more beautiful” – Ok, so say you have two job applicants for the position you’re trying to fill for a customer-facing job. One applicant, though in all other ways a seemingly good candidate, has terrible teeth - think ‘faces of meth’ bad - the other, equal in all other respects has a mouth full of perfect glistening teeth and a winning smile. Who do you honestly think you’re more likely to pick? If you think the first, you’re most likely fooling yourself, and you’re also not good at your job, being to find the person most suited for interacting with your customers and making them feel at ease. Which of the candidates do you think is more likely to stumble down a path of criminality due to lack of good job opportunities?<p>4. Yup, the Mews are definitely odd characters, that in no way invalidates their theories, and apart from some  representatives of the current paradigm in orthodontics expressing their disdain for the Mews and their theories, there’s no substantial evidence given for why they are so wrong – so wrong as to be villainous in the eyes of their critics it seems. The article ends with a cliff hanger with the perfect teethed skulls of yore. This is in fact very strong evidence that the heredity argument is plainly wrong. To argue that the crooked teeth and underdeveloped mouths that appear quite suddenly in conjunction with the industrial revolution are due to genetics is like ripping off your shirt to show the massive tattoo on your chest that says, “I know nothing about the timescales of evolution”<p>5. “This emphasis on compliance irks the Mews’ critics almost more than anything, because it allows them to blame their patients for any failures” – replace ‘the Mews’’ with ‘the sports coaches’ and *patients’ with ‘athletes’. All treatments that are not surgical require compliance to some extent to work. Changing your body through behavioural changes is obviously possible, but often requires more diligence and discipline than many are ready for. On a personal level, I fixed a massive overbite and a terrible posture as a teenager by consciously pushing my jaw forward all waking hours and straightening my back and paying attention to my posture while walking and standing. It takes time, but it generally works<p>6. What is the actual, real scandal exposed in this article? A couple of dentists who believe strongly in a theory and practice based on fairly good evolutionary reasoning and some obviously positive results? The fact that a community of bitter young men who deem themselves undateable and ugly are looking to these dentists ideas to improve aspects of themselves? Or maybe the fact that our current paradigm has no good explanation for why our collective mouths have on average degraded in modernity, and the standard treatments – that are both invasive and painful – apparently don’t fix the underlying problems.<p>7. From my own experience with everything from teeth issues to asthma, eczema and allergies, I know that the current paradigm of healthcare for all those problems is stuck on a track of symptom suppression via medication, with practitioners in general knowing nothing to very little about how things like breathing, nutrition, gut flora and many other things affect these conditions. Scientific and medical paradigms are always tough to change, and there’s a plethora of examples of mainstream practices and accepted truths that in hindsight appear absurd – such as the belief that hand washing was unnecessary for doctors between attending to patients that was dogma before Semmelweis – that are defended tooth and claw by the establishment, while detractors like Semmelweis are shunned and vilified.<p>8. Among the comments on NYT and here, many of which gleefully or dramatically jump straight at the incel angle and join in the hate and ridicule chorus (it’s apparently ok to hate and ridicule disillusioned, often autism spectrum young men who can’t find girlfriends. How sweet…), I see comments from dentists and individuals who testify to the problems of the current paradigm, and share stories of positive and negative change that lends credence to the Mews’ theories. How would the comments section have looked with another angle to the article? Are there examples of people who have started practicing these methods and have documented their results? Wouldn’t that be more interesting to look into? Oh well.<p>edit: paragraph separation\nedit 2: spell check and specifying comments on NYT and here in point 8"],"time":["2020-08-23 12:44:45"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["elric"],"id":[24250816],"kids":{},"parent":[24246577],"text":["Previous similar article &amp; discussion:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23335368\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23335368<\/a>"],"time":["2020-08-23 11:50:59"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["moltar"],"id":[24248958],"kids":{},"parent":[24246577],"text":["This was described in the Breath book."],"time":["2020-08-23 04:04:13"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["citizenpaul"],"id":[24260160],"kids":{},"parent":[24246577],"text":["Why is this on &quot;Hacker&quot; news?"],"time":["2020-08-24 14:58:35"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["trabant00"],"id":[24250403],"kids":{},"parent":[24246577],"text":["Why are trying to tie these two orthodontists to mysoginism, alt right, toxic internet forums, etc?

We can go much deeper into what Bitcoin can do, but all other chains wishing to do other things this guy mentions always were a cheap piggy back on Bitcoin.<p>I&#x27;m here to tell you Bitcoin works, and does not need anything else. Bitcoin is not slow like many folks will tell you all day long, either. Bitcoin does not have high fees, either. Bitcoin is very sound &quot;money,&quot; and not a great currency. If someone wishes to transfer money to someone else anywhere in the world, they simply tailor their fee to be low, and they send it for 40-60 cents and understand that it will confirm over the next day. (Yes, the mempool surges during times of heavy use, and yes it may take a little while longer, but just the same, millions of dollars can be sent with no third party for under $1 fee)\nThe time itself for this does not really matter, as this could never be done prior to Bitcoin. Ask those sending money home to the Philippines or folks who are unbanked how many days a wire transfer takes, and how many third parties take a massive chunk in fees. Nobody controls your money in Bitcoin, and nobody takes a fee. (Nobody is taking your money from a BTC fee, the paltry amount is paying into the system to keep the miners mining)<p>It&#x27;s nothing else beyond this, and nothing else is needed. \nAnyone can argue about this endlessly but Bitcoin solved it&#x27;s problem it was designed for, and all else is just garbage tacked on by other people trying to strike it rich.<p>I have used Bitcoin regularly since 2011. I have purchased real, legal goods from folks in other countries over forums in escrow that could not be done otherwise without incurring very large fees. I&#x27;ve paid 30 people simultaneously with one multisend transaction, and one fee.<p>Everything else is irrelevant. Bitcoin is revolutionary. Just Bitcoin. It works and it works very well.
