I am too lazy to write a blog post w&#x2F; illustration, but for audio signals, which I am more familiar with, the intuition behind DCT (and MDCT, used e.g. for mp3) is straightforward.<p>Assuming you understand that a Fourier transform is an operation to go from from time domain to the frequency domain, the problem solved by DCT, DST, etc. is related to the fact that <i>digital<\/i> signal processing are finite, and without any care, you introduce &#x27;irregularities&#x27; if you use a &#x27;normal&#x27; Fourier transform.<p>So the main idea of DCT&#x2F;DST&#x2F;etc. is to implicitly &#x27;copy&#x27; and&#x2F;or mirror the signal, to reduce the artefacts&#x2F;irregularities introduced by Fourier Transform. Reducing irregularities intuitively leads to more regular signals, and the more regular your signal, the quicker the high frequencies decrease, which is the compression effect of DCT.<p>More mathematically, but still very informally: DCT&#x2F;DST is about boundary conditions. Using DFT (the &#x27;normal&#x27; Fourier transform for digital signals) will imply discontinuities at the boundaries. For continuous time signals, an intuitive way to define regularities is to measure the decay of successive derivative of a function f(t), by looking at convergence convergence of t^n f(t) as t -&gt; inf for n. That implies that regular functions have bounded Fourier transforms, and the more regular, the faster the Fourier transform decays.<p>The DST&#x2F;DCT, by mirroring&#x2F;copying the signal, reduce irregularities, and hence their coefficients decrease faster."],"time":["2020-08-26 16:53:20"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Diti"],"id":[24281964],"kids":[24282078,24282070,24282131],"parent":[24281857],"text":["This is DEFINITELY NOT explained like I’m five.

One would think that Lisp&#x2F;Haskell&#x2F;Scala&#x2F;Julia&#x2F;Clojure&#x2F;Erlang would be concise. But in practice, I&#x27;ve found them to generally be write-only languages that are quite difficult to grok. The only thing that comes close is spreadsheets, but due to their 2D nature, they can&#x27;t really scale beyond a certain level of complexity. Honestly, I think that the lack of adoption of functional programming languages (due to their own obstinance) is one of the great problems of our time.<p>Anyway, for the past 5-10 years or so, I solve most problems in my head in a data-driven way that looks like a hybrid between MATLAB and spreadsheets, piping data between classes written in an Actor model style (I learned this from a very good teacher during a contract at HP). I use rules of thumb like no mutable data (stored state), mostly higher-order functions, and framing concepts in terms of transformations rather than class inheritance. Then I translate that to whatever language I have to use for the client, which is probably PHP, JavaScript or C# (Unity).<p>I highly recommend this sort of approach for keeping abstractions separate from implementations. Unfortunately since nobody else seems to follow this method, it makes for some friction in the workplace. People talk past me all of the time because they don&#x27;t realize that I&#x27;m coming from this place of experience. They don&#x27;t see the need for this clean separation when they are &quot;trying to get things done&quot;. They may get things done faster, but if you want bug-free implementations, this is the way to go IMHO.<p>Edit: I&#x27;m on the fence about TensorFlow. It&#x27;s arguably more advanced than MATLAB, but vastly more opaque. So I&#x27;m not sold on any advantage it provides, other than perhaps better performance or usefulness in certain domains like machine learning.

The results of the Norwegian Polar Expedition conducted from 1899 to 1900 contained the first determination of the global pattern of electric currents in the polar region from ground magnetic field measurements. The discovery of X-rays inspired Birkeland to develop vacuum chambers to study the influence of magnets on cathode rays. Birkeland noticed that an electron beam directed toward a magnetised terrella was guided toward the magnetic poles and produced rings of light around the poles and concluded that the aurora could be produced in a similar way. He developed a theory in which energetic electrons were ejected from sunspots on the solar surface, directed to the Earth, and guided to the Earth&#x27;s polar regions by the geomagnetic field where they produced the visible aurora. This is essentially the theory of the aurora today.&quot;<p>&quot;In 1913, Birkeland may have been the first to predict that plasma was ubiquitous in space. He wrote: &quot;It seems to be a natural consequence of our points of view to assume that the whole of space is filled with electrons and flying electric ions of all kinds. We have assumed that each stellar system in evolutions throws off electric corpuscles into space. It does not seem unreasonable therefore to think that the greater part of the material masses in the universe is found, not in the solar systems or nebulae, but in &#x27;empty&#x27; space.&quot;[7]&quot;<p>&quot;In 1916, Birkeland was probably the first person to successfully predict that the solar wind behaves as do all charged particles in an electric field: &quot;From a physical point of view it is most probable that solar rays are neither exclusively negative nor positive rays, but of both kinds&quot;.[12][13] In other words, the Solar Wind consists of both negative electrons and positive ions.&quot;&quot;<p>Without him, the modern study of cosmology and planetary science would be a mess."],"time":["2020-08-26 20:50:14"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["krnsll"],"id":[24285106],"kids":[24286778],"parent":[24283018],"text":["Freeman Dyson is a glaring miss here.<p>Feynman and Schwinger shared the 1965 Nobel in Physics for their respective perspectives on Quantum Electrodynamics.

The most impressive gains in AI in the 2010s (Computer Vision &amp; Natural Language Processing) were made thanks to DL. There&#x27;s a famous post by AI researcher Rich Sutton, which summarises this fairly neatly [1].<p>Now, this connection between DL and fast chips would tie the progress of AI pretty tightly to the progress of Moore&#x27;s Law [2]. There&#x27;s some compelling evidence that Moore&#x27;s Law is at least slowing down [3]. On the other hand, there are industry experts like Jim Keller who pretty strongly disagree with these assessments [4] and even TSMC seems to be bullish on being able to keep up with Moore&#x27;s Law [5].<p>Some estimates of GPT-3s training cost put it in the range of ~5-10 million dollars [6]. It&#x27;s hard to say how big of an impact on the economy GPT-3 will have. It&#x27;s probably safe to assume though, that OpenAI is already working on GPT-4. The jump in parameter sizes from GPT-2 to 3 was roughly 100x (1.5 billion vs. 175 billion) and I&#x27;m assuming the price of training the model increased in roughly the same proportion (I might be wrong here and if anyone can point me to evidence on this, it would be much appreciated). With these assumptions, and provided that GPT-4 won&#x27;t be affected by diminishing returns of adding more parameters (big if), the price for it would be somewhere between 500 million and a billion dollars. That&#x27;s still not an insane amount of money to put into R&amp;D, but you&#x27;d probably want it to be at least be somehow economically viable to be able to justify putting a hundred billion dollars into GPT-5.<p>All this is to say, that I find making predictions of the progress of AI really hard due to the large amount of uncertainty related to the field and the underlying technologies (mainly the hardware).<p>[1]: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.incompleteideas.net&#x2F;IncIdeas&#x2F;BitterLesson.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.incompleteideas.net&#x2F;IncIdeas&#x2F;BitterLesson.html<\/a><p>[2]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;2007.05558.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;2007.05558.pdf<\/a><p>[3]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;p4.org&#x2F;assets&#x2F;P4WS_2019&#x2F;Speaker_Slides&#x2F;9_2.05pm_John_Hennessey.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;p4.org&#x2F;assets&#x2F;P4WS_2019&#x2F;Speaker_Slides&#x2F;9_2.05pm_John...<\/a><p>[4]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=oIG9ztQw2Gc\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=oIG9ztQw2Gc<\/a><p>[5]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nextplatform.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;09&#x2F;13&#x2F;tsmc-thinks-it-can-uphold-moores-law-for-decades&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nextplatform.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;09&#x2F;13&#x2F;tsmc-thinks-it-can-u...<\/a><p>[6]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;venturebeat.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;11&#x2F;openai-launches-an-api-to-commercialize-its-research&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;venturebeat.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;11&#x2F;openai-launches-an-api-to...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-08-26 08:01:39"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["alpineidyll3"],"id":[24278505],"kids":[24278513,24278946,24284457],"parent":[24269316],"text":["The power cost of transistorized agi will never compete with meat neurons , ever.

About to be married, going to finish school, going on a trip... fear is part of all of these experiences, at least until you’ve done it. But I think the fear is made worse because of the stories we’ve told, and heard, about it. Modern movies are a prime example where we can watch what might happen if we die and what we might miss, etc. The more tragic a story the greater the fear that that might overwhelm us. The poems, tales, and stories highlight the effects of death.<p>But in a similar vein, I find comfort in the more positive stories too, such as the ones about Jesus in the Bible. How death came as a result of sin, and how, for some reason, a sacrifice was required to pay the penalty of sin - something else had to die in your stead, like a pigeon or sheep. But of course, how could that really pay that price? No wonder sacrifices were needed regularly. That is until Jesus’ death - an eternal life could pay for an eternal death, for good and forever. All I need to do is believe in Jesus and share that payment. This is a good story, preferable to the ending of say, 300, or Gladiator, for me at least.<p>I’m not sure the eternal life to come will eventually be boring either. The story suggests we remain basically the same, and what has been true is that we grow. True, what interested me as a kid doesn’t hold the same power over me now, nor could I as a child really get into fonts or NLP or traveling!

One moment you&#x27;re there, the next moment you&#x27;re coming back from not being there.  (Give me some leeway on the sleep thing - I know that when you&#x27;re actively dreaming or tossing and turning it&#x27;s not quite a jump cut).<p>So in that moment when you&#x27;re coming back to consciousness from a state of previous unconsciousness, what&#x27;s to say you&#x27;re the same &quot;you&quot; that was beforehand?  Sure, you remember a whole life, but then there&#x27;s this gap in continuity.  Maybe you were someone else and then all of a sudden, you&#x27;re now &quot;you&quot; with all those memories in that mushy brain of yours.<p>But if that&#x27;s the case, why is the gap of consciousness needed to separate &quot;you&quot;?  What&#x27;s to say that from any given instant to any other given instant the &quot;you&quot; is continuous, other than for this stream of memories coming from your meat brain.  Maybe &quot;you&quot; jumps around all the time.<p>But then - what is &quot;you&quot; anyway?  If we&#x27;re just a collection of meat brain memories, maybe there&#x27;s no core identifying &quot;you&quot; in the first place, and we&#x27;re all just part of a big collective pool?  Like a piece of code running in an overall shared memory space.  The complexity forms (your program &#x2F; you), and then the function exits and the memory goes back to the collective pool.<p>So then - what if life and existence is all about perspective?  I&#x27;m me because, well, I&#x27;m me.  I expeierience this life and remember these memories.  And you&#x27;re you because you experience your life and remember your memories.  Is there really a difference from a third-party observer?<p>Maybe life is simply in the eye of the beholder.  As long as there is ANY conscious life, then life is being experienced.  And so maybe death really is nothing to worry about -- you&#x27;ll get a chance to experience another life as someone else.<p>But then - why does it even need to be linear? Maybe we ARE experiencing life as someone else -- as evidenced by all the someone elses experiencing life right now :). Just because we can&#x27;t experience it (hardware limitations - sorry.  Brain can&#x27;t handle multiple sets of inputs ;) doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not happening.<p>Maybe we&#x27;re all experiencing consciousness in our own ways as part of one big system.  That leopard in the zoo is experiencing it.  I&#x27;m experiencing it. You reading this are experiencing it.  Maybe our meat brains and linear single-track memories are just a nice little lie, and we&#x27;re really just all temporary functions running as part of a bigger computing system.  Function runs, exits, memory goes back to the shared pool.  New function runs, exits, memory goes back to the shared pool.  Many functions run simultaneously - each doing only what it was programmed to do, then each exits and the memory gets released again....<p>This really gets wild when you start thinking about clone experiments (or teleportation).  Make a perfect clone of yourself right now, down to the neuron, and assemble it in across the room.  You&#x27;ll experience nothing other than to see a clone appear 10 feet away from you.  Your clone will have the experience of being you one instant, and then waking up across the room looking at you &quot;Holy cow!  Cloning and teleportation worked!  They&#x27;re real!&quot;  Then your clone will go on with life, doing the same things you want to do, remembering the same things you remember.<p>Then think about whether there&#x27;s REALLY any difference between that clone of you and any other person on earth...."],"time":["2020-08-27 00:39:09"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["peter303"],"id":[24288314],"kids":{},"parent":[24275882],"text":["In an infinite universe you will repeat exactly an infinite number of times.

If this is in a community with low immunization rates, the vaccine-derived virus can survive much longer than intended. This can actually provide a benefit to others, because they will achieve some level of immunity from the weakened virus.

The caveat &quot;wild&quot; is doing a lot of work that isn&#x27;t properly explained. What this means is that for the last several years, all the cases of polio in Africa have been from circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus - basically, a version of the weakened virus used in the vaccine which has circulated for long enough to reverse the mutations that weaken it. It spreads like wild virus and paralyzes like wild virus, but technically it&#x27;s not wild-type virus. (As I understand it, the only practical difference is that we can tell from genetic sequencing that it came from the vaccine rather than being wild-type.) And this can&#x27;t be fixed by stopping the vaccination program - in fact, that actually makes things worse, since it gives the deadly vaccine-derived poliovirus more people who don&#x27;t have immunity to infect.<p>Some of the other news coverage like the Reuters article is a little better at correctly pointing this caveat out: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;uk.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;uk-health-polio-africa&#x2F;wild-polio-sufferers-reflect-as-africa-declared-free-of-the-disease-idUKKBN25L14I\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;uk.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;uk-health-polio-africa&#x2F;wild-p...<\/a><p>It&#x27;s not even clear that it&#x27;s poasible to actually eliminate polio in developing countries with this vaccine or any existing vaccines. The developed countries managed it but they had far better infrastructure to roll out first the oral vaccine and then the inactivated vaccine to everyone, and also far better sanitation, and it&#x27;s likely both of these things mattered - under-vaccination makes this problem a lot worse, and whilst the inactivsted vaccine protects people from polio there&#x27;s some doubt as to whether it can stop them spreading it via the oral-fecal route due to poor immunity in the gut.

I think this needs further exploration. What are the incentives of the different actors? TL;DR CYA<p>Clearly, the reader just wants to get the information that is relevant for them personally, with the least cognitive effort. Then move on with their day or to the next step in their workflow.<p>The company&#x2F;government can have various incentives on various levels of the hierarchy&#x2F;bureaucracy.<p>The boss&#x2F;owner may want the company to communicate in a snappy, hip, youthful way, in a friendly and clear tone with no bullshit.<p>However, the person&#x2F;department actually writing the text may want to deflect responsibility, avoid possibilities for blame, keep things vague enough so the onus is on the customer&#x2F;citizen to make sure everything will work out. They don&#x27;t want to deviate from process. The customers&#x2F;citizens should be uniform with no exceptions, because exceptions cause work. If you write too friendly, people will assume they can get favors, that we can start bargaining because they are talking to a real person. Text written in a cold, dispassionate, bureaucratic style will not invite such answers. It signals that things are set in stone, that there is a process in place and we won&#x27;t say A or B, they will have to figure our A vs. B themselves.<p>For example, I&#x27;m a teaching assistant at a university. If I&#x27;m buried under too much work with research and get lots of complicated questions from students, I give vague answers so I can&#x27;t get blamed (&quot;But XY said it would work out this way!&quot;). Also if I use a bunch of official words and formal sentence structure, the student gets the message that I won&#x27;t do the work instead of them: there can be tons of different rules interacting, different study programs have different rule books etc. In the end it&#x27;s their responsibility. I cannot give definitive answers, but experience shows, that writing things plainly often invites more haggling than writing in an official tone.<p>The same thing happens when people talk about medical, legal and other potentially dangerous topics. Even if the actual answer is straightforward and will apply in 99% of the cases, nobody gets fired for being too cautious. &quot;Nah don&#x27;t do that&quot; is the easiest thing to say. Ask your doctor. Ask an attorney. Check the laws of your region.<p>To write plain and clear text, you need to leave all these caveats out. But people will jump at every opportunity to try to shift the blame, and if you weren&#x27;t careful, it will accumulate on <i>your<\/i> desk. To avoid this, orgs and lawmakers should make sure to reduce the legal responsibility for saying things.<p>For example I know a(n underpaid) lawyer working for a governmental institution in Hungary. They are in the communications department and give advice on certain legal things to ordinary citizens phoning in or over email. Fortunately, the laws and rules are set up such that they cannot be blamed for answering wrong or not hedging enough, they can write as they would to a family member. It&#x27;s not &quot;legal advice&quot;, because you can&#x27;t know <i>all<\/i> circumstances from just an email question. At best, the person or company who acts on such advice can use the email exchange to demonstrate due diligence. They at least tried. Still, it&#x27;s fully their responsibility to check and interpret the law.<p>Therefore, unless you shield your writers&#x2F;departments from blame by similar explicit rules, they will shield themselves through vaguery and hedging and complicated writing."],"time":["2020-08-25 19:30:05"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["marknadal"],"id":[24269333],"kids":{},"parent":[24268382],"text":["Or you could just use a writing app that yells at you for stuff like this.<p>Obligatory XKCD...<p>+ <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;simplewriter&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;simplewriter&#x2F;<\/a>\n + <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hemingwayapp.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hemingwayapp.com&#x2F;<\/a>"],"time":["2020-08-25 10:45:51"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["gdubs"],"id":[24271802],"kids":[24274057,24272360,24276512,24272669,24278776,24274750,24273544,24272303,24285082,24272908,24273056,24272662],"parent":[24268094],"text":["I was elated to read this, and then disappointed at the comments here.

The thick, fibrous bark of coast redwoods is extremely fire-resistant; it grows to at least a foot thick and protects mature trees from fire damage. In addition, the redwoods contain little flammable pitch or resin. If damaged by fire, a redwood readily sprouts new branches or even an entirely new crown, and if the parent tree is killed, new buds sprout from its base.

A 2003 survey found that just 2.3 percent of Georgians held a positive view of police.<p>&gt; Given that reality, police reform was not only a matter of restructuring institutions or implementing better policies.

My point is simply that &quot;anti-competitive&quot; is synonymous with any market that is not perfectly commoditized. Hopefully it&#x27;s uncontroversial to claim that &quot;anti-competitive&quot; is <i>not<\/i> fundamentally bad per se.<p>It&#x27;s well recognized that anti-competitive behavior which at one scale is fundamental to a diverse marketplace of products and services which drives innovation, value, and consumer choice, at another scale is used to lock-out potential new market entrants, and enable excessive profitability or rent-seeking behavior. The words &quot;monopoly&quot; and &quot;duopoly&quot; usefully describes the ultimate&#x2F;penultimate theoretical states of such a market, but they don&#x27;t adequately describe that various ways we can approach such a limit in the real world. Apple is not a monopoly, but that does not mean that there should not perhaps be elevated limits on acceptable anti-competitive behavior on their part based on the specific facts of their market position.<p>I think it is also self-evident that it is an extraordinary remedy to judicially limit anti-competitive behavior targeted at a specific company in a competitive market. Indeed when we enjoin a company from making their products function in ways that are quite central to that product&#x27;s highly differentiated user experience, yes it may grant choice to some customers of that product to operate it in new ways, it is also taking choice <i>away<\/i> from customers who may have chosen the product for exactly the functionality being target. This to me is an extremely heavy handed remedy, and should only be deployed against a company if it is absolutely warranted based on <i>unlawful conduct<\/i> by that company.<p>While the case before the judge today was simply a preliminary hearing on a injunction, and therefore not by any means a ruling on the fundamental issue, we can see this balancing act being employed in the current case. The contract that Epic willingly entered into with Apple and willingly violated is placed in one corner (blocking Fortnite) while the separate contract(s) of developers using Epic&#x27;s Unreal Engine is placed in another corner. All we know today is that this judge was not willing to allow Apple to retaliate against the violating of one contract by withdrawing from the others, and that the judge was not willing to stop Apple from terminating the first contract after it was willfully violated by Epic. The larger discussion will likely take years to play out."],"time":["2020-08-25 17:36:50"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["627467"],"id":[24272559],"kids":[24275270],"parent":[24268822],"text":["If Apple wanted (and they probably are doing it) they could heavily delay the approval of any apps that make use of an engine they seem &quot;risky&quot;...

It&#x27;s essentially the same thought process a manager goes through when they feel they are paying somebody a salary but that person is not contributing.<p>This is why independence is so critical and one of the most important traits of a grad student.  Time spent telling a student exactly what to do, again, is not always a resource well spent.<p>Anyways, this is just my perspective on things based on conversations with a couple of my immediate family members who are professors.  I went into the normal job market after getting my bachelor&#x27;s, and I see a lot of parallels between the world of academia and the rest of us.  There are different titles and the work is different, but much of the structure and politics are the same."],"time":["2020-08-25 22:54:00"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["dwrodri"],"id":[24275047],"kids":[24277146,24275315,24275422],"parent":[24274699],"text":["For those who don&#x27;t know like myself, I&#x27;m pretty confident &quot;Eric&quot; is Dr. Eric Gilbert, current associate professor at the University of Michigan and former lead of the comp.social lab at Georgia Tech.

While this is a valuable goal for disciplines that reward specialization, it does not provide enough flexibility for autodidacts with a range of interests.<p>A P.h.D. typically takes between 3 and 6 years of self-directed study. If candidates spend between 35 to 70 hours per week, this amounts to 5,250 hours on the low-end and 21,000 hours at the extreme end.<p>Of course, not all of this time is spent on research. In fact, modern P.h.D. students spend more time than necessary dealing with administrative functions like teaching, grading, and paperwork for the university.<p>What would you recommend to someone planning their own &quot;personal PhD&quot;? That is, four to six years of self-directed research on a specific topic.<p>This is something I think about often. Many citizen scientists like Franklin, Edison, and Darwin were not the result of PhD programs but instead curious professionals who conducted independent research.<p>Other specific questions:<p>- What is a suitable replacement for the role of advisor? Is there a representative person outside of academia who would provide the same type of advice?<p>- What type of fields are best suited to personal PhDs?

That&#x27;s a huge expense.<p><pre><code>    Cat v panel heater: Which is better?\n    6:34 AM, 24 Aug 2020 James Powers\n\n    Cats are affectionate, panel heaters are not.\n    How many cats do you need to heat an energy-efficient home?\n    It’s the question on everybody&#x27;s lips. Well, maybe not everyone&#x27;s lips, and it&#x27;s possible this is a niche topic, but it is relevant.\n    A 3kg cat has a heat output of 14.8 watts, or 129.65 kilowatt-hours - the metric commonly used by power companies to show you how much energy you&#x27;re using.\n    These numbers are important when it comes to the design and building of energy-efficient homes, as the heat output of random things like cats can lead to overheating.\n    For example, to be certified Passive House, a building must have an annual heating demand of less than 15kWh per square metre to maintain a comfortable temperature.\n    For a typical Kiwi house of 150sqm, the annual energy demand would be 2250kWh. The number of cats required, therefore, would be 17.35, but let&#x27;s avoid chopping cats and round up to 18 whole cats.\n    This equates to 1 cat per 8.33sqm.\n    Easy as. Let’s bulk order a cat litter.\n    Cats cost about $250 per year to ‘operate’ which equates to a total running cost of $4,300 per year*. This is a bit more than $475 for gas or $675 for electric, although the installation cost is less for cats.\n    * The calculations have used an average heat load. In reality, the heat load will vary considerably throughout the year. You will need significantly more cats in colder weather and less during mild weather.\n    In hot weather, you can, of course, let the cats out, but this represents a significant waste of resources if you continue to feed them. And as cats cannot be used for cooling, you would also have to introduce an alternative cooling system such as lizards or other cold-blooded animals.<\/code><\/pre>"],"time":["2020-08-26 01:52:21"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["nkoren"],"id":[24277284],"kids":{},"parent":[24276702],"text":["This surely should give some credit to the venerable old Solar Cat Book:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Solar-Cat-Book-Jim-Augustyn&#x2F;dp&#x2F;0898150183\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Solar-Cat-Book-Jim-Augustyn&#x2F;dp&#x2F;089815...<\/a><p>(Which would evidently make me an alarming amount of money if I could find my old copy of it...)"],"time":["2020-08-26 01:03:49"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["cafard"],"id":[24282513],"kids":{},"parent":[24276702],"text":["Then there was the couple who got a kitten.

But the decrease will be much more pronounced at lower elevations, such as Toyama, where much of the city’s snow falls with temperatures near the freezing mark. A few degrees warmer here will make a big difference. Higher elevations will likely continue to have exceptionally snowy winters, at least in the short term. Still, the culture of Japan’s Snow Country may already be changing.<p>&gt; “I remember when I was in high school there was a lot more snow,” says Tanikawa, who is now 50. “In the morning snow fell and it would fall all day while we were at school. When I came back home there would be 40 to 50 centimeters of snow to clear. My children,” Tanikawa adds, “have not had that experience.”<p>I live on the west coast of Japan at the foot of the mountains, and it&#x27;s striking how much snowfall is decreasing in recent years. The last two years have been record setting due to lack of snowfall. The local municipal ski resort didn&#x27;t open at all this past winter, and for the annual snow festival in February they had to truck in some snow from somewhere else.<p>Since temperatures here tend to hover just around freezing in the winter, a small temperature difference can mean the difference between rain or 50 cm of snow. Year-to-year differences are becoming more variable, too. Three years ago we were buried in so much snow that the city had to send in a team with heavy duty snow machines to dig us out (typically neighborhoods here are self-sufficient in terms of snow removal). We had about 2 meters piled up in our yard. But these past two years it was mostly just rain.<p>On the one hand, it&#x27;s very convenient to not have to deal with so much snow in the winter. And the mountains nearby still receive plenty of snow for skiing and other recreation. But it does feel like a part of what makes this area special is vanishing.

It’s one reason why homeless people have dogs... they serve as hot water bottles.<p>One thing it left me with is that it changed the way I walk through the city. For most people, streets are places they use to get from one place to another. They do not inhabit them as places in themselves. For me and other homeless, they were our homes. This changes how you walk a street... gives you something approaching a swagger."],"time":["2020-08-26 01:09:46"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["forgotmypw17"],"id":[24277076],"kids":[24277145,24284759,24277215],"parent":[24276671],"text":["I&#x27;ve been living largely outdoors and currency-free for several years.

This is a justified concern due to the existence of global warming and the potential loss of life and property damage generated by these immense storms.<p>I&#x27;m not a climate scientist, but I have read about climate change and hurricanes (and cyclones):<p>* In 1886 there were 7 major hurricanes that year, four hit Texas and three that hit florida. (See the hurricane tracking map for that year[1].) This was the most active year on record for hurricanes in the US, see[8].<p>* Barack Obama had the best record for hurricanes, only four hurricanes over eight years. Taft (1909-1913) had 13 in just four years over five times the rate that Obama had. Bush had 18, and Trump has had 7. The numbers are all over the place.[2]<p>* Claims that increasing ocean surface temperature will clearly generate more intense hurricane activity need to be tempered by an understanding of the energy source that drives hurricanes. It is not temperature; it is the temperature delta between the surface temperature and the overlying air that provides the energy for hurricanes, see [3], and the troposhere is warming faster than the surface according to climate scientists [4]. Wouldn&#x27;t this mean that there should be less powerful and or less frequent hurricanes.<p>* Global climate-related deaths have dropped <i>dramatically<\/i> over the last century according to data from Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters [5] and cited with a figure on p. 74 of [6].<p>* The IPCC 5 Summary Volume Final report technical summary (TFE.9, Table 1 on page 110) has this to say concerning the statement: &quot;Increases in intense tropical cyclone activity&quot;. &quot;Low confidence&quot; that changes occured (since 1950), &quot;Low confidence&quot; of a human contribution to observed changes, and &quot;Low confidence&quot; of further changes in early 21st century.
