Almost all threads are debating about superficial Bitcoin issues that has already been talked endlessly, and none of the thread focused on the main thesis of this article:<p>&gt; Bitcoin mining is a complex phenomenon that connects hardware and software, the energy and financial markets. Invisible rules govern every aspect of it. The performance of an individual operation is determined by various external factors that are often hard to quantify and almost impossible to forecast.<p>It stated that Bitcoin mining as a whole, is a complex social-economical-computational-environmental phenomenon with a huge number of moving parts and uncertainties. The most fascinating fact to me, is the direct impact of climate cycle in southern China on the mining industry, almost with a mythical tone found in some Sci-Fi novels. While Bitcoin is a highly artificial and technical construct, but its yield can be severely affected by weather, some Bitcoin miners even routinely migrate their operation according to seasonal changes like the nomadic groups of the past. The flood seasons are visible on the Bitcoin hash rate chart, and even dominates the date of trade shows and R&amp;D schedule of new mining rigs.<p>&gt; May-October is the flood season in Southwest China. It is also a festival period for mining businesses as the large supply of surplus hydro capacity significantly cuts down miners’ operating expenses. For small-medium scale miners, the flood season can reduce the cost by as much as 40%. For large miners who own proprietary facilities, the flood season electricity cost is practically negligible. Over 80% of the miners in Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia will migrate in flocks to Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou to take advantage of the discount, and they move back or sell their equipment after the dry season arrives in November.<p>&gt; Gradually, the industry structured itself around these climate patterns. Like ancient rituals, every year before the flood season arrives, major mining conferences get organized in Sichuan’s capital Chengdu. Some facilities are only open to external customers during the flood season. Manufacturers plan their new product release right before it arrives.

The basic point is this:<p>&gt; While stochastic models present us with numerous difficulties, an even more perplexing conundrum faces contemporary scientists and engineers who wish to model highly complex systems involving hundreds or thousands of variables and model parameters. Owing to their sheer number, many model parameters cannot be accurately estimated via experiment and are left uncertain. As a consequence of uncertainty, for each different set of possible values for the unknown parameters, there is a different model—possibly an infinite number of models.<p>&gt; Confronting the problems of complexity, validation, and model uncertainty, I have previously identified four options for moving ahead: (1) dispense with modeling complex systems that cannot be validated; (2) model complex systems and pretend they are validated; (3) model complex systems, admit that the models are not validated, use them pragmatically where possible, and be extremely cautious when interpreting them; (4) strive to develop a new and perhaps weaker scientific epistemology.<p>At the moment I am in favor of option 3, though option 4 might be more appealing in the future.<p>This isn&#x27;t an easy option to take. Recently I had an article accepted for publication where I basically argued that no models, including my own, were truly validated because none fit a non-naive data set well. (In another paper I argued that most data sets used for validation are too easy to match because they don&#x27;t cover the parameter space well.) A reviewer recommended rejection, basically saying that because the model isn&#x27;t validated, it shouldn&#x27;t be published. So much for being intellectually honest!<p>The paper was eventually accepted after I made it more clear that none of the popular models work that well (some are absolutely terrible in my view), and that my model improves on the status quo in a few ways.<p>Note that this situation isn&#x27;t exactly the same as that described in the link.

The Romans were engineers, so they built these fish tanks at very precise levels relative to sea level at the time.

Some individuals did work in their spare time to keep the lights on or improve things, but the lack of obvious value from tracing led to a vicious cycle where the high barrier to getting value out of tracing made it hard to fund organizationally, which made it hard to make tracing more usable.<p>Omg, this is 100% the situation at $DAYJOB. I actually think this is generally true for any new infrastructure that devs are expected to interface with. E.g. for metrics, most engineers I work with also don&#x27;t really understand Prometheus, despite it being incredibly useful with a robust query language, but looking at Grafana graphs gives them a good enough picture. The big &quot;wtf&quot; moment with tracing is always the sampling, its really hard to build a good sampling system that collects meaningful traces ahead of time, much less explain it. The article&#x27;s &quot;problems&quot; list rings really true.<p>For my story: we tried to roll our own naive system backed by ELK that piggybacked off our logging stack, which largely failed due to time&#x2F;resource constraints (kibana and elasticsearch actually worked fairly well for some types of aggregations, but some really useful visualizations like a service graph aren&#x27;t possible). I agree with the post in stating that building a good distributed tracing system from scratch definitely isn&#x27;t trivial, but it&#x27;s not very difficult given the tools that exist today. Also, the article mentions things like clock skew not mattering in practice, which if you were to approach this from a &quot;blank slate&quot; would definitely be a bit counter-intuitive.<p>Anyway, due to resourcing constraints (i.e. we had no observability team, and even if we did they wouldn&#x27;t have worked on this particular problem 1+ years ago), we use a vendor (Lightstep) which is generally solid &amp; requires very little maintenance, but there are still issues where simple conceptual queries like &quot;show me traces that had this tag&quot; aren&#x27;t possible. E.g. they don&#x27;t support things like querying `anno_index` from the article for historical data, you can only query in-memory data (so last ~10-20 mins, helpful for immediate oncall scenarios but not much else).<p>The really interesting thing about distributed tracing is that its really still in its infancy in terms of potential applications. The article focuses on performance&#x2F;oncall scenarios, but we:<p>- Built a post-CI flow that captures integration test failures and links developers to a snap shot so they can see the exact service their test failed - no digging through logs.<p>- Can see traces during local development.<p>- In OpenTracing, there&#x27;s the pattern of injecting untyped &quot;baggage items&quot; that make it through to downstream systems. We integrated this into our _logging_ clients, so you get free metadata from upstream services in logs without having to redeploy N microservices (this lets us get around some of the query limitations in Lightstep).<p>- I&#x27;m also shooting around ideas to leverage baggage items to inject sandbox data for writing tests against plolyglot, manyrepo services. This lets test data live next to test driver code (e.g. a Go service calls into a Python service &amp; we want to mock the Python service&#x27;s test data but don&#x27;t want to have to update + merge a change to that repo).<p>Kudos to Twitter for a great tech + organizational initiative."],"time":["2020-06-02 06:00:17"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["tlarkworthy"],"id":[23391192],"kids":[23391341,23391761,23392177],"parent":[23373283],"text":["Tracing is a cross functional concern, and therefore does not belong in application binaries but in a sidecar or reverse proxy intermediates, where it can be written once and applied to everything.

This paper addresses it _very_ nicely.<p>&gt; Substituting  the  hardware  parameters  listed  in  Table  4.1  into  the  solutions  above  suggests  that hiding arithmetic latency requires 24 warps per SM and hiding memory latency requires 30 warps per SM if on the Maxwell GPU – which are similar numbers. This is despite the dramatic difference in latencies –6 cycles in one case and 368 cycles in another – and in contrast with the prevailing common wisdom.<p>The paper doesn&#x27;t answer if there is a disadvantage in having too many warps, but considering that the max warps&#x2F;block&#x2F;sm is 32, we can say that you need 32 warps &#x2F; 1024 threads per SM for optimal performance most often."],"time":["2020-06-02 11:28:45"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["arnon"],"id":[23388834],"kids":[23388868,23389058,23391499],"parent":[23379709],"text":["One common pitfall with many cheap blog posts describing why GPUs are &quot;fast&quot; is the focus on the number of CUDA cores.<p>The author here does a great job at highlighting how it&#x27;s not necessarily the amount of cores that makes the big difference, but rather the memory bandwidth.<p>He also brings the memory bandwidth into his own models, which supposedly lead to much more accurate models that can help developers understand the underlying GPU technology a lot better than just &quot;we run 5000 cores on a matrix of data&quot;."],"time":["2020-06-02 10:12:59"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["person_of_color"],"id":[23388859],"kids":{},"parent":[23379709],"text":["The author is now at NVIDIA.

When we stepped out of the Uber, we were greeted with a freshly-shattered window and a freshly-closed Walgreens.<p>It&#x27;s one thing to know &quot;unrest is happening&quot; in the abstract, but it&#x27;s quite another to see it in person. So we walked through the business district and snapped some photos.<p>Business after business was boarded up, sometimes literally, sometimes with whatever they could use. Chairs, or shopping carts, for example.<p>More than that, the whole district had a remarkably different feel. Just a few months ago, it was humming and bustling with the usual energy of a semi-big city. Now it&#x27;s like people are preparing for... well, nothing good.<p>I&#x27;m not sure there&#x27;s another platform where you can tell a story like this, is there? Not with photos and text, anyway. Sure, I could put up a website and call it &quot;My stroll through Seattle,&quot; but why? I suppose Imgur would work, but it doesn&#x27;t really feel like a community to me. On Twitter you get a few &quot;Be safe!&quot; shoutouts from the people you know, at least.<p>I guess my point here is that Twitter doesn&#x27;t need to be read-only. Go participate! You don&#x27;t even have to post anything noteworthy.<p>The platform has also helped change my mind about some things. For example, it helps to consider the situation from the point of view of someone who&#x27;s afraid to call 911. I was pretty far in the camp of &quot;Let the police do their jobs&quot; before this was pointed out.<p>A lot of VCs do good work on Twitter too.

And whether you agree or not, we are under no moral compulsion at all - none whatsoever - to support FaceBook. Not using it is, at worst, morally neutral.<p>So if you oppose FaceBook&#x27;s general effect on our society, why not do something that costs you no money and requires no real lifestyle change, but can radically improve your society&#x27;s politics? Join SocialBook and get your friends too also, and as a principled stand, delete FaceBook.

I do feel a duty to support people working towards building in general, and the economy in general. But do I have a specific moral duty to support FaceBook? Of course not.

It only have yearly payments which is $109 for a year and $129 for renewal which is less than $10 a month.

Beyond the loss of valuable product, methane leaked from natural gas represent a major source of greenhouse gas emissions and widely deployable sensor systems are needed for continuous monitoring. A complicating challenge is that natural gas infrastructure is often situated near other sources of methane emissions including agriculture and wetlands, making discrimination of a methane emission from natural gas difficult to identify without complex laboratory analytical techniques. Our objective is to develop low-cost field-deployable systems using mixed-potential solid-state electrochemical sensors which can quantify the rate of emissions, identify the source of the emission, and provide an early warning system so leaks can be found and repaired quickly.
