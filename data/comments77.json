That will become self evident if you try to learn either Erlang or Elixir, when coming from a language like Python&#x2F;C++&#x2F;etc (and though Elixir looks a lot like Ruby, it&#x27;s still more like Erlang, tbh). So that can be classed as a negative.<p>Secondly, fault tolerance in Erlang&#x2F;Elixir&#x2F;OTP is not quite as simple as commonly billed. Isolated processes and supervision trees can give you a lot of mileage, but the model is not a silver bullet. I found I still needed to create an error boundary to make an application &#x27;Do the right thing&#x27; in very specific error conditions (for example, not killing a running process, when making a single, accidental RPC with the wrong arguments).<p>Apart from that though, I can&#x27;t think of much else negative to say about Elixir.<p>The tools for introspection are amazing. I recently debugged a production issue by opening a console connected to a running system, and calling the functions I suspected to be failing to see what they were returning directly. Not sure if any other language has that facility.<p>Then there&#x27;s all the stuff built into Elixir, like the test suite, the build tool, and even an official linter &#x2F; code formatter.<p>Erlang interoperability is also a brilliant design decision. Anytime I need to use a library for a task, I look through the Elixir community first. But if I can&#x27;t find something suitable, there&#x27;s often Erlang code out there with years of Dev time behind it.<p>This is just a mere fraction of all I want to say about the language.

Can you boot strap your new node with a snapshot. Should you? Well, what are you going to do about getting all the back data in?<p>- nobody is going to put private financial&#x2F;trading&#x2F;whatever details plain text on a block. so it&#x27;ll have to be encrypted. so what are we really verifying? you&#x27;re verifying what my copy of PGP produces? whatever gibberish I post to the block? I don&#x27;t want to disclose from&#x2F;who&#x2F;when&#x2F;amount&#x2F;shares&#x2F;bank-info&#x2F;exchange&#x2F;stock symbols .... nothing ... but regulators may need to see data un-encrypted ... so now what? Send regulators data the old way? While I do CAPEX the new way? C&#x27;mon.<p>- The data has to be represented somehow. Since BC brings nothing to that party ... BC will wrap Swift, FIX, Omego, or by exchange or by regulator reporting format ... so BC is a crap load of work to fix nothing about the domain. And even that is a simplification. There&#x27;s lots of little gotach&#x27;s in data reporting between all the counter parties.<p>- throughput is an issue on BC<p>- just the idea that any joe can add a box to the network and start looking at financial data ... it&#x27;s a non-starter ... although we can argue you can get some visibility from exchange data ... but traders might use BC to help settle and that may require a heck of a lot more detail that what NASDAQ provides<p>- BC isn&#x27;t a currency. A currency has to do certain things including being universally accepted in the country, have near constant value day to day. Whatever that is BC doesn&#x27;t do it.<p>- Another thing I find jaw dropping about the BC mentality is the insistence the unshakable foundation of the blockchain insofar as its non-deprecation and on the computers to apply the same logic and&#x2F;or verification and xfer fees without human interference or bias. To date BC is pre-pre-pre-neophyte status. You start bringing in serious economic pressures, 1-offs, crashes, bailouts, disagreements and I&#x27;ll bet some or all that code will fail&#x2F;falter in human hands leading to code changes leading to forking. Today&#x27;s money system didn&#x27;t start this way. It was beat into today&#x27;s shapes through problems, mistakes, and here and there some good ideas. So will BC. I seriously doubt the immutability of the rules governing blocks.<p>Now you can back off public, decentralized ... into private block chains with shared or not shared keys and the like ... or just point-to-point block chains between trusted and distinguished entities ... but very quickly ... so what are we really doing here?<p>BC is used it seems to me for speculation, buying small potato things like coffee or for the coolness factor or hiding.

After the initial steps of creating a database (not a problem for me), the database users and modifying wp-config.php, I faced all the errors the author writes about and more, and had to search online for solutions. Updating WordPress core fails due to permission issues. Cannot install plugins or themes from the dashboard because of permission issues. Heck, even uploading media files, like photos for example, for a WordPress post requires permissions to be handled. Even the location where the site is stored has to be mounted first if you’d like to explore, modify files, etc. Don’t even get me started on the black box that is ProFTPD to configure FTP access to the site (neither the ProFTPD site nor the StackExchange Q&amp;A sites were very helpful)!<p>All this would be forgivable if the documentation was adequate.

(If you host with the company that makes Local, you can even deploy to live from inside the app.)<p>I haven&#x27;t used any of the plugins designed to make static pages from WordPress, but my gut read is that they probably aren&#x27;t going to work quite right unless you A) really know what you&#x27;re doing with WP,  and B) you understand the limitations of your chosen static code generation tool. After all, WordPress is meant to be run in a dynamic environment with PHP, MySQL, and a web server. Shoehorning it into some other way of working might not end well, especially if you are new to WordPress.<p>Anyway, it looks like the author wound up on SiteGround, which as basic shared hosts go is one of the better ones. :) It&#x27;ll certainly be easier than running WP locally, generating static files, and deploying those to GitHub Pages.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;localwp.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;localwp.com&#x2F;<\/a>"],"time":["2020-08-17 12:02:49"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["withinboredom"],"id":[24182039],"kids":{},"parent":[24181153],"text":["Just to point out a caveat with the original idea: all the posts would be stored in a local database.

When covid hit full steam in March, I decided to stick it out for a while, hoping things were turn or that the reaction to the virus was overkill. Turns out covid was legitimate, and started planning my move in April &#x2F; May. Moved out at the end of June to live with family in one of the outer boroughs.  Living in Manhattan was awful during that time. The city is a pain to live in when circumstances were good, but was pretty much unbearable with covid. It made no sense to stay - I was paying awfully high rent to live in the city and not enjoy it.<p>* My landlord was a baby boomer business owner who recently brought a 2nd retirement home out of state and was planning on retiring. Covid accelerated her plans, and not in a good way. She is trying to sell her Manhattan home and use the proceeds to pay the mortgage for her new place. She originally listed her home for $1.5M, and now its listed at $1.1M and is still struggling. Her story is likely not unique.<p>* I work with a team of 7 people at work, 4 of whom (including me) lived in the NY - 2 in BK, 1 in Queens, 1 in Manhattan (me). All are millennials - 3 moved in with family, 1 moved out of state.<p>* I would say 9&#x2F;10 millennials I know who could move out of NY has already either moved in with family or out of state.<p>To emphasize - this is <i>my<\/i> anecdotal experience.

Or at least all of the additions made to them over the past decade. I think the idea that a browser like this would gain <i>any<\/i> traction outside of hardcore enthusiast circles is pure delusion.<p>Instead, what if features were prioritized based on how much of the web uses them? I&#x27;d bet that 90% of the web only uses 50% of the web standards out there. Some things like Flexbox are used on practically every new site that gets built these days. But there are dozens of obscure CSS properties that most web developers probably don&#x27;t even <i>know<\/i> about, much less use. And JavaScript APIs? There&#x27;s a host of bespoke progressive-web-app APIs (USB access, anyone?) that hardly anybody uses.<p>Also, a huge part of the web&#x27;s baggage is maintaining backwards-compatibility with the entire history of content. This is well and good, but not an ideal that an indie browser could afford to uphold. Frames, image area tags, etc. There&#x27;s probably a long tail of features - many of them deprecated - that could be jettisoned without having much impact on the average user&#x27;s experience. Even things like &quot;float&quot;, which aren&#x27;t deprecated, may have been instrumental at one point but are no longer very important.<p>Prioritizing the standards that matter and de-prioritizing the ones that don&#x27;t could dramatically cut down on the effort necessary for an MVP.<p>Taking this further: how do we know which features to prioritize? Most front-end devs probably have a rough idea, but what if we got empirical with it? What if we automatically tested the top 10,000 websites or something and made note of which CSS properties they used, which JavaScript APIs they called out to, and ranked them by frequency (and by popularity of the site?).

But they are kind of the most wasteful creation ever. The most obscene apps of yesteryears would do a lot more with a lot less.

I think the complexity comes from (apart from over engineering syndrome) trying to deny that there&#x27;s two very distinct use cases of web.

Those two required rewrites of significant portions of any app that tried to bridge the transition using only supported APIs.  And every new point release (say, 5.1 to 5.2) brings a enough more minor deprecations to make an upgrade not a task, but a project.  That&#x27;s forcing a lot of significant rework, and every one of those gives people a chance to just take their project elsewhere.<p>(There&#x27;s actually a third alternative.  The release after these two major components were removed from core Rails, they were still semi-supported as add-on libraries.

If maintaining compatibility is the goal then I can&#x27;t see how removing a function in a new API version will ever work. Maybe it&#x27;s because companies are expecting people to be dumb and call support when they use this deprecated API that was specifically designated as unsupported. &quot;But I can use it,&quot; they&#x27;d say, and still complain that it breaks or something. Maybe that workload is what they&#x27;re trying to avoid. But maybe they&#x27;d silently move away instead if continuing to use the platform meant rewriting everything.<p>Second: Why don&#x27;t people usually have automated API refactoring tools? When I was trying to port a Minecraft mod to a later version I found a bunch of things had changed in the engine. Okay, go to MCP and look at what changed. Guess what? It&#x27;s all a bunch of Markdown. They painstakingly went through the process of labeling every single API change and method renaming and so on, and they put it all in <i>Markdown.<\/i><p>There was so much missed potential there. Imagine if you had a policy encouraging your developers to put down every API change you make in your program in a machine-readable, schematized format that could be printed to a webpage or Markdown or something else, but could <i>also<\/i> be combined with a static analysis tool to at least print out the parts that need changing, if not refactor them, just like Google&#x27;s internal tooling? If developers don&#x27;t notate those changes by hand then that information is going to be permanently confined to unparseable changelogs and obscure IRC conversations. That&#x27;s the kind of thing that a semver increment can never capture the nuance of. Why guess what broke or manually parse changelogs based on a major version increment when you can have a computer do all the work for you?<p>Maybe it&#x27;s because a changelog is &quot;information to throw away,&quot; that you&#x27;d have the painful time trying to read through the moment things break and then can forget about a couple of days later when the refactoring is done. But the changelogs and migration steps are essentially a bridge closing a chasm, with your entire userbase on one end trying to get to the other, and if it&#x27;s not made easy enough for them to cross they will either give up and leave or stay on the other side forever."],"time":["2020-08-15 15:31:50"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[24167650],"kids":{},"parent":[24165445],"text":{},"time":["2020-08-15 12:09:47"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":["bickeringyokel"],"id":[24166781],"kids":[24167021,24167043],"parent":[24165445],"text":["&gt; One fun bit of trivia about Bigtable is that they had these internal control-plane entities (as part of the implementation) called tablet servers, which had large indexes, and at some point they became a scaling bottleneck.<p>Anyone understand the technical jargon here?

The layoffs are a consequence of their strategy for finding alternate revenue streams being simply too weak to produce tangible results. Certainly not anywhere near levels that would allow them to justify having the ambitions of a big VC founded silicon valley based company with offices in e.g. the middle of the real estate bubble called Mountain View (as well as several other premium locations world wide).<p>What they do technically with their browser product is fine however and worth protecting. I just don&#x27;t see that costing in the order of hundreds of millions&#x2F;year. A couple of million goes a long way to keep a world wide collective of developers going. Many OSS projects manage with far less. It doesn&#x27;t require maintaining offices in the downtown areas of SFO (in addition to Mountain View), London, Paris, Portland, Berlin, Taipei, etc.<p>I use Firefox exclusively; like many other users. The wider community of Firefox developers and users has plenty of ways to keep the project going long term in one way or another.<p>Same with Rust. Rust will be fine without Mozilla. It&#x27;s widely used and loved by engineers useful to quite a lot of companies. IMHO the rust community is actually much less dependent on central management by anyone (including Mozilla) than the Firefox browser. Most long lived OSS projects need independence like that and thrive because of their independence.<p>Luckily, Mozilla has a very decent licensing policy (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;MPL&#x2F;license-policy&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;MPL&#x2F;license-policy&#x2F;<\/a>) that crucially does not include any copyright transfer. That means their role is strictly as a facilitator of development; not as an owner of the copyright to the code. That means that in principle there is room for other companies to get involved or for independent developers to get involved.<p>Which is why I&#x27;m not worried about the project surviving the drama of their mother organization imploding or not.

But we&#x27;re past the point where that might do any good with respect to salvaging Firefox or Mozilla&#x27;s name.<p>Mozilla Corporation&#x27;s role today is to siphon away any attention or enthusiasm that might otherwise be directed towards the ideals that Mozilla was originally created to facilitate.  The Mozilla Corporation was supposed to have been set up to further the ideals of the then already extant movement that had been operating on a shoestring budget.  The imprimatur should have been to direct its paid staff towards doing the boring work that unpaid (but highly effective) volunteers weren&#x27;t interested in—not to wrench control away and consolidate power within a (now-proven ineffectual) company making ill-conceived commercial plays while trying to fit in with the culture of the Valley and squandering billions.<p>In the early 2010s, I attended a conference—one sponsored by Mozilla—and brought in on their dime, having been a fairly involved contributor for a few years, but not someone on the corporate payroll.  Another guest and I mentioned how poor a job the travel agency had done, essentially fleecing Mozilla and doing much worse than if we&#x27;d arranged for travel and accommodation ourselves and then forwarded the bill.  &quot;Mozilla has <i>a lot<\/i> of money&quot; was the response.  After the better part of a decade, Mozilla&#x27;s revenue has only grown, and so has their propensity to squander money.<p>The best option we have now is for folks to wake the heck up, to realize that the Mozilla that exists is not the one portrayed in either its messaging or fixed in the minds of casual slacktivists, to start a grassroots effort (a la early Firefox) to work on an independent browser—where, unfortunately, the best bet at this point is probably in leveraging WebKit against Chrome and Blink, given what an untameable mess the modern Web has become (not helped by the FirefoxOS efforts; nor the mess that Gecko codebase has become)—and most importantly <i>never allow that effort to be subverted in the way that the Corporation managed to cannibalize and take over Mozilla<\/i>.<p>But that&#x27;s not going to happen, because Mozilla continues to position itself as the organization where folks with a casual interest in the health of the Web are supposed to direct their good vibes, while thoroughly proving itself to be unworthy and incompetent at upholding the principles it&#x27;s supposed to be fighting for, and while time and time again, the public have proven themselves to have short attention spans on the order of months—so, by the end of the year Firefox and Mozilla will be back to being perceived as your old chum that&#x27;s fighting the good fight, instead of being steered by a bunch of clueless, well-salaried Bay Area devs LARPing as some motley crew with your best interests at heart, all while the term &quot;non-profit&quot; gets bandied about in public discussions, much to their delight."],"time":["2020-08-15 10:27:22"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[24167983],"kids":{},"parent":[24166385],"text":{},"time":["2020-08-15 13:03:37"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":["GNOMES"],"id":[24171584],"kids":{},"parent":[24166385],"text":["I have been forcing myself to use Firefox the last two months.

Conflicting preferences are normally no big deal. You just, y’know, weigh them, make your tradeoffs, and reach a decision. But when the preferences apply at different timescales (pie now, thinner later) humans suffer from a massive irrationality which philosophers call akrasia and economists call dynamic inconsistency and normal people call … being stupidly short-sighted, or in the case of time management: procrastination.<p>Commitment devices are a way to change your own incentives so that willpower is a non-issue.

I’ve gone by this adage that “a little bit each day” is better than doing a lot in a single day with a few days off. For instance with exercise (Running) instead of saying no to doing it I say ok maybe half the distance. And as a result it turns into a habit which I think is the single most important tool we have to improve ourselves. It’s kind of taking this situational approach and applying it every day. Another example from my life is soda. I read a lot about the negative effects sugar has on my body and as a result I feel guilty when I buy it, this is another way to motivate myself into a habit of “not buying soda” I started to buy less and now when it isn’t even available my laziness prevents me from leaving the house to go get it :) this is really similar to another comment that said “create systems” where the inevitable outcome is your goal, and I find parallels between this “system” idea and culture in general.

If it has, say, a 40-50% false negative rate, I don’t really care how cheap and fast it is, that sucks.
