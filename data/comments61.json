A unit is a piece of the software with a clear boundary. It might be a whole microservice, or a chunk of a monolith that is internally consistent.<p>- What triggers writing a test is what matters. Overzealous testers test for each new public method in a class. This leads to testing on implementation details of the actual unit, because most classes are only consumed within a single unit.<p>- Behavior driven testing makes most sense to decide what needs tests. If it&#x27;s required behavior to the people across the boundary, it needs a test. Otherwise, tests may be extraneous or even harmful.<p>- As such, a good trigger rule is &quot;one test per desired external behavior of the unit, plus one test per bug fixed&quot;.

If a bug was put into code it could take months where subtle parts of the internet would be failing.  This wasn&#x27;t an option, so we had strict testing.  I think for every line of code we had 2 to 3 lines of equivalent test code.  From this experience I&#x27;ve found:<p>1) I found a natural way to write pseudo TDD I prefer.  When I&#x27;m mocking up some code in a project, I write interface code to run what I&#x27;m writing.  I run the code from time to time to make sure it&#x27;s working.  If I&#x27;m not doing that, how do I know my code it working?  You get a sort of dopamine high when running the code and seeing everything come together.<p>What I do is I take that interface code I wrote while creating the code and instead of deleting it, I create a test function (or multiple) and I copy paste it there.  If I&#x27;m in a hurry I&#x27;ll come back and write the assert_eq or equivalent later.<p>Writing a test is that quick.  You&#x27;re already doing 95% of it.  Just copy paste it into a function.  I know it&#x27;s not always that simple, but often times it is.  When approaching testing this way there is no reason not to write tests.<p>2) Systems tests catch far more than integration and unit tests, so if you&#x27;re serious about testing, these should be considered.  Systems tests go by many different names, so by this I mean a testing echosystem where the system is spun up and a mock client and mock servers are ran.  This simulates a real world client connecting to the software and tests the real world results they would get.<p>The reason system tests catch so much more than unit tests is in a large system not everyone knows every functionality and how it should work.  It&#x27;s easy to create a regression where a new feature is added but it changes the behavior of this old previously unknown feature.  This often results in going back to the drawing board as it&#x27;s a business issue more than just a software issue.  These kind of bugs can get pretty nasty in the enterprise space if unchecked so it&#x27;s a good idea to catch them.<p>Furthermore, systems tests catch nearly 100% of what unit tests and integration tests catch as well.  This is because if there is a bug in a unit caught, it will propagate out to the client affecting behavior.  If it is caught in a unit test and not a systems test, then there might be a hole in systems tests where it&#x27;s not testing every scenario, or you might have dead&#x2F;unused code in the code base or something similar.<p>Systems tests I&#x27;ve found are better at catching race conditions as well.<p>Systems tests act as a great source of documentation, because they document how every interface in the program is intended to act.  You get a quick high level view and can learn the ecosystem quickly from it, where unit tests are down in the weeds.<p>And finally, you don&#x27;t need to write anywhere as many systems tests as you do integration and unit tests.  You can test a lot more with a lot less work."],"time":["2020-08-26 20:17:25"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["rerx"],"id":[24281774],"kids":{},"parent":[24281195],"text":["(2014)"],"time":["2020-08-26 14:29:46"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[24282235],"kids":{},"parent":[24281195],"text":{},"time":["2020-08-26 15:26:40"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":["TheRealPomax"],"id":[24283616],"kids":{},"parent":[24281195],"text":["What&#x27;s the tl;dr of this article?

(I work with legacy corporate systems mostly so that&#x27;s how I am biased)<p>TLDR: it never had a chance of working<p>The basic problem of TDD is that it has a huge cost to it and therefore you have to do it right to not only get any benefits but to just get even.<p>In a perfect TDD utopia, all developers would start with a set of clear, complete requirements and then implemented each requirements with a clean and concise test and then ensured their code passes the test. Then later, with not much additional effort, these tests would be used to verify that whatever shenanigans you are doing to your project still cause functionality X to do Y when Z happens.<p>Unfortunately, this fails to capture whole diversity of the development reality.<p>- It is rare you get clear and concise requirements. Most corporate code is just something that a developer decided should happen in a situation, not a result of meticulous discussion and planning. As such, preserving these requirements in stone has much less value than one might think because now instead of preserving objective truths about how the application should work you are spending time to preserve what an intern Joe decided this should be doing with probably little regard for entire system.<p>- There isn&#x27;t a way to tell your tests are complete and good quality. Whereas an application must implement functionality and must be doing (something) right because otherwise your users would notice missing or faulty functionality (users are ultimate verification of your app), tests can be as incomplete as you want and as pointless as you like and will still &quot;pass&quot;. Thus, completeness and quality of tests is completely on a whim of developer. Guess what, if they can&#x27;t get the app right will they be able to at least get tests right? And if they can get the app right the lack of tests is the least of their problems. By having feedback on how teh application functions from their users the developers are &quot;forced&quot; to deliver something at some level of quality. By having no feedback on tests quality developers are not forced to deliver anything (other than to satisfy tests) and if they are not forced to do something no user or manager will ever look at they are most likely do only what is absolutely necessary (to pass automated gates).<p>- Most developers want to be done with a task and there is this bunch of stuff they have to do that is just annoying because it has no immediate bearing on how the application functions. That bunch consists of refactoring, documentation, code reviews and guess what, tests. Do you know why documentation is typically poor if at all? Do you know why code reviews mostly focus on little stuff and rarely attack big problems? Because overwhelming majority of developers don&#x27;t put their heart into stuff that does not bring them closer to achieving the goal (except reading HN, taht is, and other forms of procrastination).<p>- Management. While they will usually &quot;require&quot; tests, I have never in my life seen that a development was extended to get more time to &quot;get tests right&quot;. Usually tests is something you have to do as quickly as possible to meet the requirements rather than something that is seen as core to the project functioning.<p>- Developers. Most developers are already overwhelmed with stuff they need to learn to be able to functioning in increasingly complex technological jungle. Microservices? Devops? Full stack? Given choice to spend time learning skill of doing tests right and learning above not many developers will choose tests. Making quality tests is a skill that like any other skill require you to apply yourself.<p>- Refactoring functionality in a legacy system (which is theoretically exactly the reason you might want tests) requires that you know exactly what you are doing. This means understanding what changes are &quot;safe&quot;. When I refactor a piece of code I try to form a hypothesis that the change is not going to break functionality and then prove it by following code leads (how the function is used, etc.) until I am satisfied. Doing hundreds or thousands of refactorings one by one requires from me that I am 100% certain I know I am not breaking anything. If I were to use tests to help me do refactorings I would also have to have close to 100% trust in that these are correct. Unfortunately, there are no tests to test that tests are correct or complete. Therefore, I cannot use tests to replace my process of following code leads and this makes tests useless for my needs."],"time":["2020-08-26 14:53:04"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["calebm"],"id":[24286580],"kids":{},"parent":[24281195],"text":["yes"],"time":["2020-08-26 21:57:26"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jpswade"],"id":[24284468],"kids":{},"parent":[24281195],"text":["Betteridge&#x27;s law of headlines applies."],"time":["2020-08-26 19:03:47"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["blargmaster33"],"id":[24285074],"kids":{},"parent":[24281195],"text":["100% Code coverage or go home!"],"time":["2020-08-26 19:48:17"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["PaulHoule"],"id":[24283459],"kids":[24283756,24283762,24284268,24286195],"parent":[24281195],"text":["When I hear &quot;Kent Beck&quot; I reach for my gun.<p>I don&#x27;t have a problem with &quot;Kent Beck&quot; as an individual but more than anyone else in software &quot;Kent Beck&quot; is a brand like &quot;Anthony Robbins&quot;.

Most of the Pollack supporter&#x27;s comments seem to assume that if a person doesn&#x27;t think he&#x27;s a genius of incredible technical ability, then that means that person is automatically an ignorant person that&#x27;s making wild, uninformed, random guesses about how art is created.<p>I think Pollack&#x27;s paintings are aesthetically pleasing. I&#x27;m not a professional artist, however I am an art and art history hobbyist. I have been for decades. I like his paintings. I don&#x27;t, however, think they are special or that he was an artistic genius whose paintings should have broken the record at one point for the most expensive work of art ever sold. That&#x27;s OK though, we all have different tastes and a guy with $100 million just happened to have different tastes from this guy with no millions.<p>However, my opinion isn&#x27;t random or uninformed. I know how a painting is created. How the surfaces are prepared. How preparatory drawings and smaller studies are done. How the final drawing is made. How the underpainting is done. My art is pretty bad compared to professionals. However, studying it for decades means I&#x27;ve watched actual masters do their thing for a countless number of hours. I know how the Italian masters created their works of art in great detail. I know how Pollack created his. The level of technical skill required to become a master of classical realism is absurd. Pollack&#x27;s strength was executing and publishing an idea no one had done before. In the grand scheme of all of art, I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a particularly strong strength when compared to masters of classical realism.<p>My opinion is based on an intimate knowledge of what it takes to be that good. If you disagree with my conclusion that&#x27;s fine and reasonable but to pretend that everyone doesn&#x27;t consider him a highly skilled genius is ignorant is in itself pretty ignorant.<p>If I wanted to create a work like Pollack&#x27;s, there would likely be a learning curve, but we aren&#x27;t talking the same amount of practice and preparation that classically trained artists require to even be semi-competent. Like I said before, the biggest strength of the work he is known for was originality, not technical competence. He might have also been technically competent as an artist, but when I look at the works that made him famous I don&#x27;t see it.<p>I&#x27;d be willing to hang all kinds of abstract &#x2F; modern &#x2F; postmodern art on my wall because it adds color, sometimes has great composition, and is aesthetically pleasing. However, most of it just isn&#x27;t meaningful to me in the same way that other genres of art are like classical realism and impressionism. I don&#x27;t think anyone should feel like that&#x27;s a personal attack on their preferences. I&#x27;m not missing something, it just has a different effect on me. If you don&#x27;t like classical realism you aren&#x27;t missing something either, you just like different things."],"time":["2020-08-27 01:42:37"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["validuser"],"id":[24286092],"kids":{},"parent":[24269430],"text":["Does it redraw the entire thing every frame?

If you doubt this, watch how much this comment is downvoted.<p>One thing we know, based on over a century of data around the world: increasing density of housing has little effect on affordability, in the long run. More often than not, it has the <i>opposite<\/i> effect. More simply, we do it backwards: we claim--based on in-migration &#x27;projections&#x27; that are nearly always overestimates--that there&#x27;s a shortage and we must build our way out of it. Example: 20 years ago, Portland estimated a million new residents by 2025. Growth in that period: 105,000, in large part due to annexation.<p>This leaves out the realities of how things get built. Private developers do the work, for profit, most often for investment groups. If it doesn&#x27;t &#x27;pencil out&#x27;, nobody will build it. And this is why &#x27;affordable housing&#x27; demands, codes, agreements all get bargained down in the end.

There are a LOT of empty apartments in this city. There are also a LOT of &quot;short term rentals&quot; in the city that sit vacant.<p>Here are the concerns that I do not see addressed with this:<p>1. Will the City of Portland make the required infrastructure improvements to support more density? For example, will the storm sewers, which currently overflow poo into the river, support all the extra.. poo.<p>1a. Will the city invest in roads and public transit? Walking and biking are both great, but Portland is cold, dark and wet for 7 months a year. No matter how easy and safe you make it, people won&#x27;t want to ride in those conditions.<p>1b. Portland 911 systems are currently stressed beyond reason. I waited on hold for 4 minutes on 911 (not non-emergency) a few weeks ago. This isn&#x27;t a rare occurrence.<p>1c. Will Portland address the tent in the room? Homelessness is endemic in the city, and it isn&#x27;t _only_ due to lack of housing. The city has very few options for mental health and drug treatment. Will the city invest in that? If not, livability will be negatively impacted by this.<p>1d. Assuming COVID ever ends, will Portland be business friendly enough to attract employers to employ the expected glut of people? Right now, large business are leaving Portland (Google has halted its expansion plans for example).<p>1e. Will Oregon fund schools in a way that can account for the new residents? Schools are already over-crowded and Oregon has one of the worst graduation rates in the country. Will the city&#x2F;state commit to building schools to support new students? If so, where? They are in-filling in neighborhoods with few plots available<p>2. This will disadvantage low-income workers who won&#x27;t be able to afford the new houses. Though more density does lower prices, it normally lowers prices in the less desirable neighborhoods. People of means buy the new condos&#x2F;townhomes that are built, leaving the poor to take the less nice houses or continue to live further out.<p>2a. The Utopian dream of a urban playground where everyone is walking and birds are chirping and there is Trek in every garage doesn&#x27;t play for a majority of people. People rarely live where they work. This is not normally a personal choice. Other factors play into it. Being around their family, kids&#x27; friends, better schools, new job on the other side of town etc. I understand the myopia of the crowd on this site is to picture everyone has a well-connected and well-heeled tech worker, but reality is far different.<p>3. Tongue in cheek-isg: this is all celebrated within the same week as another story claiming people are abandoned the density of SFO, NYC, SEA to work remotely in towns like BOI, AUS, Bend etc. There is obviously a _desire_ to have land and space and privacy.

Current Supreme Court jurisprudence is very clear that businesses — including monopolies — have no duty to deal with third parties, and if they do choose to deal with them (or are even compelled to), that they can choose the terms on which to do so. The only exceptions are if the monopoly in question changes the rules in an unprofitable way with the express purpose of driving out a competitor, or if any company — not even a monopoly — changes access to after-market parts and services.<\/i><p>Current US antitrust law does not favor Epic in this matter. Of Epic&#x27;s ten claims, their strongest claim is probably the one tying in-app payment processing to app distribution services, but even that one is far from a slam dunk.

I think there is near universal agreement here, including from SpaceX.<p>However, there is no way to become a space faring civilization without putting lots of things in space, period. I want to see 1,000,000x more objects in space, including much larger ones.<p>If we truly become space faring, we have the matter and resources to have a quadrillion humans living in comfort (likely in large rotating space habitats like&quot;O Neil Cylinders&quot;). This is the kind of dream we could have, imagine over 100,000x the humans, artists, friendship, science, and love. We can simultaneously make earth an ecological paradise, with most of the planet reserved for nature.<p>This &quot;anti-satellite&quot; movement seems to generally have 4 kinds of attacks against the satellites:\n1) The satellites &quot;impede my rights to view the sky&quot;. The implication is that anyone who attempts to build in their &quot;view to infinity&quot; violates their rights. This seems like an extremely presumptuous statement, like they own trillions of miles. This also doesn&#x27;t match the current legal framework of any country (nobody needs your permission to fly over your house in aircraft or space).\n2) The usecase of these satellites is bad because they are &quot;like cell towers&quot;. Getting low cost internet access for the planet is IMO an extremely good thing, one of the best things for the poor.\n3) The satellites will kill astronomy. This is absurd, we will have much better astronomy if we are a space fairing species with cheap space access and many things&#x2F;expertise in space and giant telescopes outside our atmosphere. It may kill amateur astronomy from earth eventually, but I just don&#x27;t think that as society a relatively fringe hobby should stop the progress of humanity. Many hobbies have been killed over time. I personally think this will inspire more people to look to space, and have the opposite effect.\n4) We should not put things into space, and we should look to reduce our impact on the universe. This also manifests itself in those that want to see population reduction on Earth. I believe consciousness is better than lifeless rock. I say this as a human and a parent who has brought consciousness into the world.<p>Lets upgrade our dreams, take to the stars, and make the universe a more interesting place."],"time":["2020-08-26 18:41:15"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["dvaun"],"id":[24283550],"kids":[24283676],"parent":[24283229],"text":["The technical report is quite large (105MB).

I built Lulim Jewelry after spending some time figuring out how to design and 3D print my own wedding band.<p>My day job was in the 3D printing industry and I knew how far the technology had come so I busted out the CAD tools and designed a ring with my wife&#x27;s fingerprint on it. I thought the processes could be much easier and thus Lulim was born.<p>The website is built with Vue.js, Canvas.js, and Three.js. Unfortunately those last two can be somewhat resource intensive so I&#x27;d love to get feedback from others regarding performance on different devices, OSes, and browsers. I decided to do as much work in the client side as possible so that this website is cheap to keep running. I wanted my costs to scale with sales and to minimize any recurring monthly fees. This is my first real Vue app so I am sure there are things that could be better!<p>Feedback on the company idea, site layout, tech stack or anything else is appreciated!<p>If anyone is interested in buying a ring shoot me an email (jack @ &lt;companydomain.com&gt;) and I can give you a decent discount."],"time":["2020-08-26 05:31:19"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["fortran77"],"id":[24284107],"kids":[24284175,24286513],"parent":[24275941],"text":["BTW: The name &quot;Lulim&quot; is the Arameic for spiral, in Modern Hebrew there are words like &quot;<U+05DC><U+05D5><U+05DC><U+05D9><U+05DF>&quot; (&quot;Lulyan&quot; &#x2F; acrobat) that take this root)<p>See: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.de-bruyn.it&#x2F;english&#x2F;0557_lulim.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.de-bruyn.it&#x2F;english&#x2F;0557_lulim.shtml<\/a>"],"time":["2020-08-26 18:34:38"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["enclosure_guy"],"id":[24284794],"kids":[24284999],"parent":[24275941],"text":["Hey Jack, nice work!
