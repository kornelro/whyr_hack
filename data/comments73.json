The stock market is forward-looking: Investors are betting on what the world and the economy look like in 12 to 18 months from now, not what they look like today, tomorrow or this fall.<p>2. The big get bigger: Much of the stock market’s success has been the result of a run-up in value for a few big technology companies — including Apple, Amazon and Microsoft — that make up a large share of the index. And retailers like Walmart and Home Depot are growing in part because small businesses have closed, allowing the bigger companies to take even more market share.<p>3. Betting on a vaccine: Given the daily headlines about the potential for a vaccine, investors want to be invested in the market when the news comes that there is a genuine vaccine, on the assumption that it will send stocks even higher.<p>4. The only game in town: With the Federal Reserve planning to print money for the foreseeable future, investors don’t want to be in cash or bonds, which are steadily losing value. So where else can they put their money? The stock market has become a default.<p>5. Help from Washington: As dysfunctional as Congress has proved to be, investors are betting that Republicans and Democrats will find a way to keep plying the economy with stimulus. (Anecdotal stories suggest some Americans have even taken their $600 unemployment checks and invested them in the stock market.)<p>Of course, all of these rationalizations don’t take into account the possibility of a terrible second or third coronavirus wave, a delay in the discovery of a vaccine, a constitutional crisis come the election in November, runaway inflation, the prospect of higher taxes to pay for the stimulus, a more significant trade war with China, or the dozens of other risks that seem to be bubbling just below — and in some cases on — the surface.<p>In the meantime, happy trading!&quot;<p><i><\/i><i><\/i><i><\/i>*<p>#4 I hadn’t thought of, and is a VERY troubling sign I think.

Government fiscal and monetary keeps the economy on life support until that happens.  If you value a business bottom up and you think 2021&#x2F;2022 sort of revert back to 2019 then by now in 2020 you are basing your valuations on those numbers and decreasing the equity value where necessary for businesses that took on debt to get through 2020.

It&#x27;s almost worse than PG&#x27;s one, which didn&#x27;t really pretend to be an in-depth analysis. Some starting points:<p>- Taxes are guaranteed, but growth isn&#x27;t. It also doesn&#x27;t come for free, it takes work. You can&#x27;t just say &quot;hey S&amp;P returned 10% last year, I&#x27;ll assume that for a given&quot;. Also wealth is often non-diversifiable - Elon Musk&#x27;s or Jeff Bezos&#x27; wealth are tied to their companies. They could feasibly take a 50% tumble in a year (can&#x27;t see how but it&#x27;s totally possible). Of course these two will still be very rich even then, but what about &#x27;minor&#x27; millionaires?<p>- People with these levels of wealth already pay, or should pay, high taxes on other things: CGT, VAT, income tax, corporation tax, land &#x2F; real estate taxes. If they don&#x27;t, then this is the real problem, you shouldn&#x27;t fix it by just adding another patch on top of a stack of leaky patches. Already, in all developed economies I know of, a huge chunk of income tax comes from the top earners.<p>- And further to that, taxation isn&#x27;t simply about maximal resource extraction from a productive population. Tax is a societal commitment to fund things we all care about. It is generally widely understood and accepted that wealthier people pay more, because the poor can&#x27;t. But when the rhetoric becomes &quot;let&#x27;s extract as much as we can from the rich, look here&#x27;s a notebook that shows we can&quot;, I&#x27;m not surprised people start looking at tax avoidance. As the rich person, you become dissociated from the society - they are only there to shear you, so why should you make an effort to give back?<p>- And it&#x27;s not inherently wrong to be rich, also. Sure, some people are rich and abuse other people, possibly with some strong ties between one and the other. But the solution isn&#x27;t a punitive tax. In a way, that makes it worse - makes it feel like you paid your dues and now you&#x27;re really above the law.<p>- The point of wealth is that it should be productive. So the business of being rich is to have money, have it return an interest higher than inflation (on which you already pay CGT usually), and consuming the excess. It&#x27;s not enough for the tax to be below average growth rates.<p>Perhaps I should explain, that I write this from (a) outside US where there doesn&#x27;t seem to be such a toxic inequality in the society (and not simply because of wealth taxes...), and (b) I&#x27;m not rich, but hey, I&#x27;m working hard to maybe be there one day.

Twingate is deployed as a network overlay on top of your existing network so you can enable remote access to any protected host or destination without having to re-architect your network. Just deploy our connectors inside any number of existing networks, define access policies by destination address, and install our client apps on your device for access. No firewall changes, routing rules, proxy configurations, etc. Access your private resources using the local IP or private DNS you’ve always used and we handle all the routing and local DNS resolution automatically.<p>We’ve designed Twingate with developers in mind and built a number of features to make remote access easy for development teams. Twingate provides a single interface for developers to access multiple environments, supports any protocol and app out of the box, and intelligently segregates and routes traffic via the most direct path to minimize latency.<p>You can try it out for free and we’d love to hear your feedback!<p>We also have a extensive documentation on how Twingate works here if you’d like to take a peek under the hood: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.twingate.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;how-twingate-works\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.twingate.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;how-twingate-works<\/a>"],"time":["2020-08-19 19:07:15"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["benmccann"],"id":[24215121],"kids":[24216154,24217049],"parent":[24212784],"text":["How does this compare to Tailscale?

Scoop (for package management on Windows) and Rosewell (which now supports Windows) made this super easy and pleasant.  But ... why would you spend your time writing Free software to benefit such an ecosystem?

For what it is worth, here is my two cents on a topic - a wealth tax - that may seem on the surface to be benign but that is in fact just the opposite.<p>Silicon Valley was founded in a spirit of freedom and flexibility but that spirit is clearly and dangerously on the wane insofar as the political environment surrounding the Valley is concerned.<p>By the 1970s, American enterprise was in decline, a victim of the &quot;big government&#x2F;big business&#x2F;big labor&quot; trends glamorized by establishment types of that day. What this did was take away choice and flexibility.<p>Tech changed all that and it did so from the heart of Silicon Valley. Tech arose from a spirit of freedom and flexibility. Founders would get an idea and would have countless ways of experimenting with what they could do with it with the aim of building a venture. Many of the most wildly successful ventures came out of nowhere. No central committee could have planned for them. No overlords of big business could have had the imagination or risk-taking fortitude to push them at the expense of their established cash cows of that day. No union could comfortably impose rigid work rules onto such amorphous ventures (the first thing Intel workers did even after the company succeeded was to reject unionization). No minimum wage or overtime rules applied. Benefits packages of the type widely deployed in the analog-based large businesses of that day were unheard of.<p>Regulators and taxers of that era continually tried to realize their vision of locking people into situations by which they would have guaranteed security, ossifying the mature businesses over which they had control, but tech simply outran them through innovation. And, in time, upended them by disrupting their industries through innovation and risk-taking.<p>Today, the spirit of Silicon Valley has changed and is yielding to a belief system by which the overlords of politics believe they can dictate outcomes that will give people locked-in security forever. Want to do something as an independent to earn a livelihood? Sorry, AB5 forbids that and will penalize the hell out of any venture that seeks to use fleelancing and flexibility as a foundation for innovation and growth. Your choice to act an an independent is frozen out by dictates that, if you act at all to make a living, you must do it within rigid systems that guarantee minimum compensation, regulate overtime, prescribe minimum guaranteed benefits, and the like. If this kills opportunities, no problem: there will be other rules that guarantee basic income, limit the rent you have to pay, and otherwise regulate society such that people are guaranteed a risk-free existence courtesy of decrees enacted by political proclamation.<p>This new mindset is precisely the one of the 1970s-era leaders who managed to choke off innovation and growth in old-line businesses and gave a massive opening to tech innovators, particularly those in Silicon Valley.<p>pg&#x27;s modeling of the effects of a wealth tax is spot on. And it confirms that such a tax is an innovation-killing idea that would destroy the spirit of Silicon Valley. Of course, tech innovation will not cease. It will just move elsewhere to escape the tax. Europe in the 1990s had a couple of dozen or more countries that imposed wealth taxes. Today it has three, if I recall. There is a reason for that. It is a highly pernicious tax that kills enterprise and that veers from a capitalist (even progressive) philosophy into one that is directly of a Marxist&#x2F;communist variety that has left so many nations in rubble once fully implemented. Smart, innovative people are not going to stick around for the con game. They will leave.<p>I have watched Silicon Valley grow and flourish for decades now and have been directly involved in working with thousands of entrepreneurs who have been a part of it. There have been a lot of political changes over those decades but one thing remained constant: the foundational thinking in California always assumed a capitalistic structure. Once that is abandoned, Silicon Valley will be no more.<p>I know that the vast majority of HN&#x27;ers are progressive in their thinking and we all can have our own ideas about what makes for a good and just society. I am not commenting on that here.<p>There is a line that cannot be crossed, however, without killing the Valley itself and all that it stands for. The wealth tax clearly crosses that line and, if things are allowed to go that way, the consequences may not be what you expect them to be. It doesn&#x27;t take much to switch from a tax of .4% on assets over $30M (bad as that is in itself) to a tax of a much higher rate on a much lower threshold of assets. Once that monster is unleased, who knows where it will go. It will be fundamental transformation of the Valley, and not a good one.<p>As I said, just my two cents."],"time":["2020-08-18 18:52:18"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["paulhart"],"id":[24198327],"kids":[24198429,24205194,24198356,24198695,24198591,24198477,24199107,24198489,24198398,24199531,24204513,24198545,24204386],"parent":[24198172],"text":["Someone forgot to model growth in the value of the asset, and&#x2F;or putting the wealth to use.

It is clearly beneficial to everyone to live in a society where people are well cared for and have healthcare, public education, welfare, etc. There&#x27;s a reason failed states and unstable&#x2F;developing countries generally aren&#x27;t where people are looking to startup the next big tech company.<p>Third, any smart founder isn&#x27;t going to just sell 1% of their stock every year and pay the wealth tax with that. They&#x27;ll take dividends, or take out a loan against the value of the stock, or use some cash from other investments, or whatever, and maintain control of their company.

One way to think about is you want your tax system to walk as softly as possible while getting from point A to point B. Don’t distort intertemporal decisions if you don’t have to. Don’t tax elastic things when you could tax inelastic things - impose taxes on things where the optimal allocations don’t change much with the new disincentive. A wealth tax takes this result and compounds it. I should really consume my wealth instead of saving it. So you’re rewarding the spendthrift and hurting the saver (the investor). Investment and growth (and overall welfare) suffer. The caveat to all this is that a wealth tax that’s a one-time unexpected confiscation of wealth shouldn’t distort incentives, which is kind of approximated by the estate tax (poorly approximated since its still expected). But the wealth tax is really not about optimal tax theory. It’s about saying the quiet part out loud - taking from the wealthy because there’s a belief that it improves democracy.

If you have $100m and the floor is $50m, the wealth tax can only take half.<p>Third... there is money going in and out besides the wealth tax. Interest is the big one.<p>The table is correct either way, but the implication of a 2% wealth tax over 60 years, assuming a 6% average rate of return is that your $100m will become $1bn instead of $3.3bn. That&#x27;s the 70%.<p>Maybe 6% is unfair. For the currently very wealthy (Zuck, Bezos, Buffet) they earned more in recent decades. Maybe 4% would be fairer. Maybe 8%. IDK.<p>Also, consumption is relevant... at least below a certain level of wealth. Consumption rounds to zero for Gates&#x2F;Buffet&#x2F;Bezos levels of wealth.<p>A point to note (for proponents) is that a wealth tax will not produce very much tax. It is much smaller than a VAT, income tax or such. Whether you are for it or against it, think of it more like tariffs. It&#x27;s an economic policy. The tax itself is a side effect.<p>I do think it&#x27;s over-the-top to represent these only as 60-year effects. The conclusion that a 0.5% tax represents 25% of your stock is... that seems wrong. Over 10 years that is just 4.5% and the founder will be paying taxes out of interest&#x2F;revenue.<p>If it affects founders&#x27; country&#x2F;regime selection, it would make sense to move after you make the money.  Most of the tax is in the future."],"time":["2020-08-18 16:52:54"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mattsoldo"],"id":[24200322],"kids":{},"parent":[24198172],"text":["This isn&#x27;t the correct way to model wealth tax&#x27;s effect on founder equity.

Founders would re-consider sky-high valuations during funding rounds because of the effect on their tax rate. Startups may consider generating real cash-flow earlier on in order to issue dividends to their shareholders to cover the wealth tax instead of selling shares.

The income gap between capital and labor that has been growing since the 1970s (as observed by, e.g. Piketty) is largely due to housing [1]\n2. Economic growth and opportunity is increasingly concentrated in the the urban areas (and even within cities, a handful of them are responsible for most of the growth), however, zoning laws makes it very difficult to build new housing there and thus for rural labor to join the economic party. Thus, as we concentrate economic activity we explicitly exclude huge swaths of the population from participating in it.\n3. With finite land, concentrated opportunities (i.e. no viable alternatives [2]), and overt house building restrictions, workers who do have the opportunity to work in urban areas are &quot;willing&quot; to pay the absurdly high rents that landowners ask. You can clearly see this in the Bay Area where, prior to COVID-19, the rents would just track the income level of tech employees. The current landowners are the main winners of the success of the urban areas.\n4. On top of that (and specific to the USA), if a landowner decides to sell a property, the sale will be taxed as a capital gain which has a lower tax rate than the labor rate. We are literally incentivizing rent-seeking.<p>A Land Value Tax (LVT) taxes the value of the land (rather than that of the property). This has the following benefits:\n1. It incentivizes more efficient usage of the land (a single family house and a high-rise pay the same tax if the have the same footprint and are next to each other). \n2. Land is finite, so it can&#x27;t &quot;disincentivize&quot; land production.\n3. When land appreciates, it is rarely if ever because the owner invested in it, rather because the economy around it makes it more valuable. This tax captures that value and returns it to the community (rather than privatizing it and giving it to the landowner). \n4. It is a progressive tax.<p>Instead of arguing whether and how to implement a wealth tax, we should pursue a national LVT.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Land_value_tax\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Land_value_tax<\/a>\n[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.brookings.edu&#x2F;bpea-articles&#x2F;deciphering-the-fall-and-rise-in-the-net-capital-share&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.brookings.edu&#x2F;bpea-articles&#x2F;deciphering-the-fall...<\/a>\n[2] Technically, you can choose from a set of successful cities, but they all follow similar patterns."],"time":["2020-08-18 18:04:22"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["gok"],"id":[24199870],"kids":{},"parent":[24198172],"text":["The real problem with wealth taxes is that they really can&#x27;t raise very much revenue.

In essence: &quot;The farmer keeps a hoard of seeds in his silo! The seeds collect dust year round until he decides to plant.  There is great want and famine in the world! If we go and take the seeds, we can end hunger, the laborer can eat better!&quot;  Which is to ignore that once you consume capital, it&#x27;s gone -- in our example, no more food gets produced because all the seeds were eaten.  This is precisely why political systems that institutionalize theft appear to be prospering temporarily, their consumption is being subsidized by capital consumption before their unavoidable demise.  Often people get confused or abuse the methods of how economies account for these factors (capital, allocation, prices) but the brass-tacks reality is unavoidable.<p>&quot;Ah ha!&quot; says the taxation wonk, &quot;We will be smart about how much we take.  We will only take just enough so that the farmer will have <i>just enough<\/i> seeds to keep farming.  We will call it &#x27;normal profits&#x27; or &#x27;reasonable profits&#x27;&quot;  And what happens when the farmer has a few bad harvests (or say a global pandemic disrupts the taxation-wonk&#x27;s plan)? The farmer (and country) stop producing food because &#x27;normal profits&#x27; or &#x27;reasonable prices&#x27; don&#x27;t exist in the real world.  Mandating charity (welfare taxation), savings rates (interest rate manipulation), or service allocation (defense spending, roads etc) always blow up.<p>The opponents of wealth taxes argue that 100% of their purchasing power is due to their own work&#x2F;negotiation which ignores that much of asset-price inflation is due to government-monies being perpetually diluted to appease in-groups.  You choosing to pay to go to a Beyonce concert and increasing her 1&#x2F;2 billion net worth isn&#x27;t the action causing the musician down the street to starve (it&#x27;s the fact that no one is willing to trade his music services for what he wants).  Some amount of Jeff Bezos&#x27;s wealth is warrantied.  If someone wants to trade a money for a certificate of stock, no one has been robbed.  But if individuals are forced into buying certificate of stock to escape the dilution of purchasing power by money dilution, that is an undue benefit to Bezos&#x27;s portfolio.  It&#x27;s also an undue benefit to allow the money issuers to control who gets access to lending&#x2F;credit -- rather than the worker who decides to lend out their past labor in money form (creditor) and debt holder.<p>The reason why people are starving isn&#x27;t because the farmer refrains from consuming or planting seeds -- it&#x27;s because the price of labor rendered in the past is stolen from workers by the money they&#x27;ve been paid being diluted by money printing.[1]  By taking from the farmer who consumes the least seeds and produces the most food (the most profitable) to give to the farmer who consumes the most seeds and produces the least food (less profitable) is a method of subsidizing consumption.<p>This isn&#x27;t to say that economic collaboration&#x2F;unions&#x2F;co-ops cannot be profitable nor that they will be profitable.  If the union renders certain offerings and charges listed prices, individuals can choose to join that union (say &quot;sign up for a box of farm produce for X price) if it&#x27;s profitable for them to do so -- Which is an economic calculation only an individual can make not a central planner decided if a group should join such a union, as profits are local.<p>But to bastardize collaboration&#x2F;co-operation and insist that everyone will be better off if they are force through compulsion (often through violence, sometimes social isolation) to pay into the union and take out of the union and force the union the accept members which are unprofitable for it to serve, is to ensure that those who take the most and contribute the least to the union will eventually subsume the membership from those who take the least and contribute the most.<p>Read more about the Cantillon effect here:\n[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.austriancenter.com&#x2F;cantillon-effect-populism&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.austriancenter.com&#x2F;cantillon-effect-populism&#x2F;<\/a>"],"time":["2020-08-19 01:30:41"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["bengotow"],"id":[24198334],"kids":[24198605,24198399,24198428],"parent":[24198172],"text":["Wow, this ignores both the &quot;floor&quot; below which you would not be subject to the wealth tax (in the US, most recently by Elizabeth Warren, this has been discussed as $50M+), and ALSO fails to take into account that you would be growing your principal at ~3-8% a year through investment, etc.<p>Sure, I guess with no floor on the tax and with your money just literally sitting in a pile, the government would eventually take a lot of it."],"time":["2020-08-18 15:35:53"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["sanj"],"id":[24199113],"kids":{},"parent":[24198172],"text":["tl;dr: compound interest works both ways<p>This is a shallow analysis.

Let&#x27;s try modeling the effects of zero wealth tax to see what they would mean in practice for a wealthy individual and for a startup founder.<p>Suppose you inherit a large amount of money or found a startup in your twenties and then live for another 60 years. What will be the impact of a small or zero wealth tax on your holdings?<p>Suppose the wealth tax is 1%, the long-term capital gains tax rate for large incomes is 20%, and the annual growth of stock value is 8.25%[1]. That means that each year the wealthy individual experiences an 8.25% growth split into 1.65% growth paid in taxes and 6.6% gain, of which 1% goes to pay wealth taxes, for an annual gain of 5.6%. Which means after 60 years the net worth of the wealthy individual will have grown by 1.056^60 or over 26x growth. By comparison, a 0% tax rate would result in a net worth growth of 46x.<p>It may at first seem surprising that lowering wealth taxes to 1% or even 0% would produce such dramatic effects. The reason lack of wealth taxes have such dramatic effects is that the growth is applied over and over to the same money. Income tax happens every year, but only to that year&#x27;s income -- having a higher after-tax income can make someone rich, but more in proportion to their income. Whereas if you live for 60 years after acquiring some asset, the growth in value of that asset will compound 60 times. Ownership of assets compounds.<p>It is also worth considering that the startup founder who never diversified their holdings, never accepted funding or joined y-combinator, and also never spent their salary buying additional stock, but simply retained ownership of the company other than paying wealth taxes, the percent ownership of the company would drop from 100% to 0.55% at a 1% wealth tax or remain flat at 100% with a 0% wealth tax.<p>Of course, with modern financial tools no startup founder need experience this: they can simply create different classes of stock, including some founders stock that has enormously overweighed voting power and then sell off only their regular shares to pay for the wealth tax. We already see this with major world companies like Google, Amazon, and Facebook that remain entirely under the control of their founders.<p>Surely a tax rate as low as 1% (or even, shockingly, 0%) would lead to rampant wealth inequality and an out-of-control Gini coefficient.<p>[1] The assumption of a return that is consistent across different stocks or even consistent from year to year is highly inaccurate. But if we remove this assumption then all calculations become irrelevant and the only conclusion we can draw is &quot;some people get lucky, others don&#x27;t&quot;. That isn&#x27;t useful, so we&#x27;ll assume it is consistent.

For non-primary research, prototypes are developed by corporations via grants from government agencies.<p>* Bell Labs, before AT&amp;T monopoloy breakup, was a special business case.

For those who read the famous analysis of criticality accidents in non-military settings, you need some smart folk hanging around to prevent disasters.<p>For example, Sun Labs had people working (forever) on some hopeful breakthrough.  Howard Davidson, a failure engineer, was pulled off task when server boxes started breaking (paper washers being glued in manufacturing) or card connections started failing (silver substituted for gold).

While potential competitive advantage is one reason to pursue research and development, taxes and the interplay between tax and corporate accounting are another reason (even prior to 1981).<p>While taxes paid by corporations benefit the general public, from the corporation’s point of view taxes are money out the door with zero possible return.  So what does a prudent corporation do with its profits?  It recognizes that they are potential capital and seeks to maximize the risk-adjusted return on capital.<p>It can bank them at the risk-free rate of return, but we should remember taxes will take a healthy chunk out of that return on the front end.  It can pay them out to investors as dividends (increasing the return on remaining capital by reducing the denominator).  Note that under rational tax schemes the risk adjusted return on capital should be equivalent to investing at the risk free rate of return (modulo management of cash-flow risks).  It can buy riskier assets with higher return, such as other companies.  And it can make much riskier investments, like research and development.  As with most things financial, the best overall risk adjusted return on capital is diverse in both kind and in risk level.  It should do all of those things (treating dividends as equivalent to investment at the risk free rate of return), with the proportion going to each tuned to achieve the aggregate optimum(1).  Also, can you see how a regulated utility with(like AT&amp;T of old) would find R&amp;D attractive for spicing up its asset mix?<p>Think of R&amp;D as producing a stream of lottery tickets with the drawing in the distant future.  Those lottery tickets (for a tech company) can pay off in two ways.  One is that they could produce or enhance a revenue stream.  The other is that they could reduce risk in the form of patents (reduce competitive risk and risk of patent suits by threat of countersuit).  Both of these payoffs improve risk adjusted return on capital (by generating return or reducing risk).  The neat thing about R&amp;D for a company that’s paying real taxes is that much of the cost is (from a tax point of view) is an expense.  In other words, that allocation of capital doesn’t have the upfront bite taken out of it that occurs when profits are directed to risk free assets. Looking at this from a risk-adjusted return point of view, having a real tax burden increases the appetite for risk by decreasing the relative attractiveness of the risk-free alternative after taxes.  This is doubly true for expenditures that look like expenses to tax collectors but look like capital investment for corporate accounting purposes.<p>None of this holds true if a company isn’t paying much in the way of taxes on its profits.  It doesn’t mean some amount of R&amp;D isn’t still attractive, but the appetite for risk is lower.  And let’s be clear, R&amp;D in research labs is the riskiest kind of R&amp;D.<p>Well, you might say, the 1981 R&amp;D tax credit is sweeter than a deduction.  Doesn’t that tilt the scales back?  Yes, but subject to the limitations of the tax credit (which are numerous).  But, like the deduction, the tax credit is much less valuable for companies that aren’t paying taxes on their profits.  And, to be clear, this is a Reagan measure taken with full knowledge of what was expected to happen to corporate tax rates and the impact that might have on R&amp;D investment.  It’s a partial mitigant for that, nothing more.<p>I am fully aware that I have murdered both CAPM and the practice of accounting in compressing this down to a reasonable post with what I hope is a clear narrative.  My apologies to practitioners of both.<p>(1) An important aside: People make equity investments to take more risk in the expectation of higher return.  Beyond the cash cushion necessary for minimizing cash-flow risk, massive cash hoards do nothing but dilute the risk (and return) rational investors are actively seeking to take.  There is some argument to be made that large tech companies keep huge cash hoards because their core businesses are riskier than they appear (esp black swan events), but it probably has more to do with founders desire for independence."],"time":["2020-08-19 00:49:03"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["totesraunch"],"id":[24205142],"kids":[24207439,24209608],"parent":[24200764],"text":["This is Capitalism.

You lost me when you said i have to train models? Are you assuming that software developers want to train machine learning models to do something as simple as creating some test data?

Make no mistake, the latter course remains very, very possible. At their peaks, no one would have believed this fate would take Common Lisp, Ada, Oberon or Pascal. Each had a vigorous ecosystem and numerous devoted users and implementers. Each still has devotees in its obscurity, but each&#x27;s present obscurity is undeniable.<p>These truths must be voiced, and acted on, if Rust is not to share the fate of those once equally-vigorous languages.<p>The first uncomfortable  truth is that the numbers <i>matter<\/i>. It is not enough, for a language to succeed, to gain new users, trying out the language, at a satisfying rate. They must also remain users, and must find, before they give up, that early difficulties adjusting fade. They must find the language better, on <i>all<\/i> the axes that really matter, for the problems they face, than what they have used before. Hard as it may be for it fans to believe, this is not the universal experience. Rust is stronger on some axes than the languages people come to it from, and weaker on others. It must become strong on all.<p>The borrow checker, as it is implemented, ultimately turns away too many new users before they achieve proficiency, and burdens exploratory designs when they are least ready to carry it. The slowness of builds is an enduring impediment to production use that will not continue to be excused. The NPM-like ease of falling into unwise dependency on abandoned library components, and the permanence of unfairly-claimed names in the repository, are traps that lead to troubling experiences. Scrupulous users will identify other problems.<p>To achieve maturity is not the norm, for any language. It is, it must be repeated, a game of numbers. A large-enough number of people must be motivated to try it. A large-enough subset of those must find enough to like to motivate them to continue learning. Enough of <i>them<\/i> must stay long enough to learn enough to do their regular work in the language. And, enough of those still on board must find a place where they can actually do their work in the language. If any of these <i>numbers<\/i> is not large enough, for long enough, the language will unavoidably fade into obscurity, deserved or not.<p>As popular as Rust already is in some pockets of the wide internet, these numbers are not now large enough for Rust to endure and not fade. The window during which its newness and trendiness are enough, on their own, to motivate people to try it is rapidly closing.<p>While nothing can guarantee success, many things can guarantee failure. One of the latter would be not to change what keeps the numbers down. Needed changes will be unpopular with self-selected early adopters who overcame difficulties and have little contact with those who did not, and left; but change is necessary.<p>The first and most uncomfortable change needed is to make the borrow checker less draconian. Allow beginners to know how many violations they have, yet run. A running and useful program motivates improvement at every level, ultimately including rigor. Dead code benefits no one, howsoever clean it is.<p>Beginners exploring the language need early, even if partial, successes. Everyone exploring the design of a new program has far more urgent concerns than borrow rigor. Those can always be returned to, in time, and will be if they remain visible. Allow libraries with violations to be used, and even to be shared, unguarded by &quot;unsafe&quot; blocks; still noting, in each build, how many violations remain.<p>Rust&#x27;s reason for being invented was to displace unsafe languages from use where they are most harmful, most particularly C. In this it is, however resolutely, failing. The C users who remain have seen many, many languages rise to popularity and fade away, and have resisted all temptation. They are self-selected to continue resisting temptation. Most remaining C users love it for its faults. They are proud to overcome C&#x27;s faults, individually, without help.<p>Most former C users who might have jumped already did. Many jumped to C++. Coding C++98 is enough like coding C that the merits of Rust, particularly its modernity and its initial simplicity, had appeal. But Rust has become complicated, and C++ has evolved, through C++11, C++14, C++17, now C++20, soon 23, and 26. Coding C++20 is little like coding C++98; 98&#x27;s temptations to unsafety do not appeal.<p>Furthermore, C++ is and will remain a much stronger language than Rust for capturing semantics in libraries. Moving to Rust means a dizzying step down in expressive power, both in ability to capture semantics in libraries and to use the uniquely powerful libraries it has enabled. While such power is needed in a minority of applications, it is needed badly there. C++ is not being displaced by Rust.<p>New Rust users are coming, predominantly, from other languages instead, notably Java and Go, and scripting languages. Rust is an overwhelmingly better design than the first two, and runs overwhelmingly faster than the others. But its safety, when borrow-clean, does not distinguish it from them. The appeal of safety is not what wins the users it gains today.<p>Rust wins users from these languages by being a better experience. The borrow checker is just tolerated, in exchange for the language&#x27;s modern and substantially more powerful design, including its Drop trait that enables programmed control of resources, its default const and default pass-by-move semantics, and the careful, comprehensive and coherent design of its built-in and core library types.<p>If Rust succeeds and does not fade, it will be by playing to these strengths among current users of these other languages, but moreso by resolving its weaknesses. The painfully slow compiler can and must be replaced, if it cannot be fixed. The library ecosystem must be made a strength, not a cause of weakness and fragile dependency. And the borrow checker must become an aid to rigor, not a gauntlet for beginners to suffer and, too often, fall to.<p>Rust&#x27;s future will be assured only when more complain of its flaws than boast of its successes."],"time":["2020-08-18 20:06:10"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["nickx720"],"id":[24200392],"kids":{},"parent":[24199424],"text":["Great news :)"],"time":["2020-08-18 18:07:01"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["blargmaster33"],"id":[24200961],"kids":{},"parent":[24199424],"text":["More SJW?"],"time":["2020-08-18 18:47:38"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["mseepgood"],"id":[24200527],"kids":[24200956,24200985,24201334,24200703,24200774],"parent":[24199424],"text":["&gt; in the middle of a global pandemic<p>&quot;global pandemic&quot; is a pleonasm."],"time":["2020-08-18 18:15:21"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["whynotwhynot"],"id":[24201997],"kids":[24204078,24203322],"parent":[24199424],"text":["I tried getting into Rust, but found its ownership model to be a bit too cumbersome (for me, maybe not for you.)<p>I&#x27;m playing with various PLs designed for safe concurrency, including this one called Pony:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24201754\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24201754<\/a><p>Hopefully not off topic, as both Rust and Pony share a similar agenda."],"time":["2020-08-18 20:03:30"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["bzb4"],"id":[24200020],"kids":{},"parent":[24199424],"text":["What I want to see is a Firefox foundation."],"time":["2020-08-18 17:41:49"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ajross"],"id":[24199819],"kids":[24199904,24199892,24199907,24199879],"parent":[24199424],"text":["Does it seem tone-deaf to anyone else that this blog post is clearly written from the perspective of and to be interpreted as the opinion of the Mozilla project leadership and not the &quot;Rust Project&quot;?<p>I mean, if there&#x27;s any time where you want to be clear about the distinction it would be now, right?

My second and last encounter with multi-touch was in the published game <i>Hotel Dusk: Room 215<\/i>. It had a puzzle where two switches were displayed on the touch screen, and the solution was to put two fingers on the touch screen and pull the switches at the same time. I tried dragging with just the stylus at the midpoint between the switches, and that didn’t activate it: I truly had to put both fingers on the screen for it to work.<p>My question: why wasn’t this capability of the Nintendo DS more widely used or advertised? Was there some technical limitation on the multi-touch feature that made it only work under certain conditions? Did it require some private API (that was somehow figured out by a third-party game developer  and approved by Nintendo nonetheless)? Or was the only reason that most players didn’t have two styli, and developers didn’t want to encourage players to put their dirty fingers on the touch screen (which was, admittedly, prone to scratching)?"],"time":["2020-08-19 04:22:14"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ricksl"],"id":[24196347],"kids":[24196538],"parent":[24195751],"text":["Wow this blog has an entire article series in this format with more than a dozen write-ups.

I think the word “imagine” is great because we imagine that we really are a Buddha in the form of this figure. Not only do we imagine looking like this figure, but we also imagine speaking, thinking, helping others and experiencing pure enjoyment with all our senses like it does. We also imagine having all its good qualities, such as equal love and compassion for all beings and deep understanding of everything. Of course, to do this successfully we need to have trained beforehand in each of these qualities with sutra practice. Putting them all together with deity-yoga, then, is like a dress rehearsal for actually being a Buddha. By rehearsing now, we build up powerful causes for attaining enlightenment.

After my Mother&#x27;s passing last year, I decided to strut out my first mixtape of just five songs. I was extraordinarily nervous, as being transgender, I had assumed an entirely different tone and inflection in my voice; and rapping was something I had rarely done before.<p>I put it out in July of last year, and; to my surprise, the music was incredibly well-received; well-reviewed by my peers - and - to my surprise, each song on that 5-track mixtape, with no advertising, has had tens of thousands of listens on Spotify since.<p>The confidence increase in this was immense! My anxiety about certain integral things has certainly gone down - especially in the field of music, I second-guess myself far less often than I used to; I hit &#x27;stop&#x27; on over-analyzing things earlier than before, amongst other tangible benefits. I&#x27;ve never even performed on stage and often end up with around $100-300 of revenue a month just for putting myself out there. (Which, in streaming revenue; is a shockingly large amount of streams!)<p>There have been serious crises in my life since my Mom&#x27;s passing; I had to take leave from my work for time, but; guess what? Nobody listening to my music knew any of that.

It&#x27;s a tool that helps you bring offline files, such as CSV, Excel, and JSON files, into Postgres database. You can also process your data before uploading it using a spreadsheet-like interface or by writing a custom Python script. Once your data is in the database, you can query it using any third party tool (credentials will be provided). You can also access your data via REST API (powered by PostgREST) or create custom endpoints to serve a more specific use case.<p>A bit about the tech:<p>Currently, we support .csv, .json, .xls, .xlsx files. For data processing, we use Pandas, so if you are comfortable using Python, you can write your own custom functions to process the data. We also give you a free shared Postgres database to test the tool with (your data is isolated and hidden from others). Each one of these databases come with an instance of PostgREST preinstalled, so you can query your database using REST API ([<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;postgrest.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;v7.0.0&#x2F;](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;postgrest.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;v7.0.0&#x2F;)\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;postgrest.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;v7.0.0&#x2F;](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;postgrest.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;v7....<\/a>).

Somehow most of a century later, the intelligentsia persists in claiming that views such as these (i.e. those also of Dawkins et al.) are somehow &quot;childish&quot; or &quot;culturally illiterate&quot;.<p><i>I cannot understand why we idle discussing religion. If we are honest—and scientists have to be—we must admit that religion is a jumble of false assertions, with no basis in reality. The very idea of God is a product of the human imagination. It is quite understandable why primitive people, who were so much more exposed to the overpowering forces of nature than we are today, should have personified these forces in fear and trembling. But nowadays, when we understand so many natural processes, we have no need for such solutions. I can&#x27;t for the life of me see how the postulate of an Almighty God helps us in any way. What I do see is that this assumption leads to such unproductive questions as why God allows so much misery and injustice, the exploitation of the poor by the rich and all the other horrors He might have prevented. If religion is still being taught, it is by no means because its ideas still convince us, but simply because some of us want to keep the lower classes quiet. Quiet people are much easier to govern than clamorous and dissatisfied ones. They are also much easier to exploit. Religion is a kind of opium that allows a nation to lull itself into wishful dreams and so forget the injustices that are being perpetrated against the people. Hence the close alliance between those two great political forces, the State and the Church. Both need the illusion that a kindly God rewards—in heaven if not on earth—all those who have not risen up against injustice, who have done their duty quietly and uncomplainingly. That is precisely why the honest assertion that God is a mere product of the human imagination is branded as the worst of all mortal sins.<\/i>"],"time":["2020-08-19 01:26:44"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["OneGuy123"],"id":[24205428],"kids":{},"parent":[24196417],"text":["His father caused his &quot;lack of desire to speak&quot; by beating him for each speaking error while he was a child.<p>Dirac solved this error as best as a child could: by not speaking.

In this game, you have different stats and you must increase each stat.

Life is very similar, but the stats are:<p>- Work\n- Social Life\n- Money\n- Fun\n- Relationship\n- Family\n- Sleep\n- Exercise\n- Relaxation<p>If all you do is spent all your time on Work, all the other stats will be lacking and ultimately you will have a weak character. Your work may be at 99&#x2F;100, but your Sleep may be 20&#x2F;100, or your relationship&#x2F;family may be 40&#x2F;100. So, the way I switch off work is that at 1:00PM I take 1 hour off of work (no matter what.) and I do not feel bad about it because it is ultimately increasing my Relaxation&#x2F;Fun stat. At 5:30PM, I stop work entirely to focus on everything else in life such as Fun, Relationships, Family, Exercise, Social Life.<p>I find it very strange how well this model works for me.

If you like beer&#x2F;wine&#x2F;pot&#x2F;games&#x2F;etc, getting your favorite at-home vice&#x2F;hobby going after work is another good mental signal.<p>Good luck!

Hah. I kid. I have a dedicated home office, so when I&#x27;m done I just leave the room and don&#x27;t go back until the next day. But, you don&#x27;t have that option, so that&#x27;s not fun.<p>You need to stick to a schedule.<p>Don&#x27;t work in pajamas. Do everything you&#x27;d normally do to get ready to go to a job and be on time (it&#x27;s great that you have extra!) I just mean, shower and get dressed sort of thing. I won&#x27;t do work attire though. Yuck. At least we toned down the business casual to jeans and stuff years ago. I can&#x27;t stand that look, and those shirts. I&#x27;ve always rebelled. I&#x27;m not a Kohl&#x27;s mannequin. I&#x27;m wearing shorts and a t-shirt.<p>At the end of the day:<p>If you work on a company laptop, pack that thing up. Shut it down, and put it in a backpack or whatever. The day is done.<p>I usually make myself leave (at least go outside) the house when I&#x27;m done. Sometimes I get in the car to just pick something up at a store. Or just drive for 10 minutes. I do like the peaceful drive of electric cars. Most of the time I say &quot;hey&quot; to the cats and get some belly rubs in, not like they haven&#x27;t been bugging me throughout the day, and then go out in the friggin&#x27; sweltering heat for a bit. Just to shut my brain off from work stuff. I put in some earphones and listen to music, podcasts, audio books. Things to just get my mind off of things and switch. I try to not hit the couch, or I&#x27;ll end up bingeing on some stupid show that I don&#x27;t care about at all.<p>Plan on chatting with friends, family, or something at the end of the work day as well. Get into a social mode.<p>In the end, screw the 60+ hour work weeks you can get sucked into. Yuck! Might as well get a side gig instead."],"time":["2020-08-18 14:56:56"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}}]
