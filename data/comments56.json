They hosted the database on SQL Server shared clusters and much of the application backend in VMware instances running on &quot;mainframe-grade&quot; servers (dozens of cores, exotic high-speed storage).  The hardware outlay alone was many hundred thousand dollars, and we interfaced with no less than 5 FTE&#x27;s who comprised part of the teams maintaining it.  Ours was one of a few applications hosted on their stack.<p>Despite repeated assurances of dedicated resource provisioning committed to us, our users often reported intermittent performance issues resulting in timeouts in our app.  I was the first to admit our code had lots of runway remaining for performance optimization and more elegant handling of network blips.  We embarked on a concerted effort to clean it up and saw huge improvements (which happily amortized to all of our other customers), but some of the performance issues still lingered.  Over and over again in meetings IT pointed their fingers at us.<p>Eventually we replicated the issue in their DEV environment using lots of scrubbed and sanitized data, and small armies of volunteer users.  I had a quite powerful laptop for the time (several CPU cores, 32GB RAM, high-end SSD&#x27;s in RAID) and during our internal testing I actually hosted an entire scaled-down version of their DEV environment on it.  During a site visit, we migrated their scrubbed data to my machine and connected all their clients to it.  That&#x27;s right, my little laptop replaced their whole back-end.  It ran a bit slower but after several hours the users reported zero timeouts.  This cheeky little demonstration finally caught the attention of some higher-up VP&#x27;s who pushed hard on their IT department.  A week later they traced the issue to a completely unrelated application that somehow managed to monopolize a good chunk of their storage bandwidth at certain points in the day.  Our application was one of their more-utilized ones, but I bet correcting this issue must also have brought some relief to their other &quot;tenants&quot;.<p>I know this isn&#x27;t a perfect example, but it demonstrates how architecture encompasses a whole lot more than just the DB and apps.  There&#x27;s underlying hardware, resource provisioning, trust boundaries, isolation and security guarantees, risk containment, management, performance, monitoring and alerting, backups, availability and redundancy, upgrade and rollback capabilities, billing, etc.  When you scale up toward Heroku&#x2F;AWS&#x2F;Azure&#x2F;Google Cloud size I imagine such concerns must be quite prominent."],"time":["2020-08-30 22:05:18"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["aszen"],"id":[24329291],"kids":{},"parent":[24324142],"text":["Earlier we used to have multiple web apps with separate databases, now we are using a single web app that can connect to different databases and configuration based on the subdomain, so far it&#x27;s worked great, having a single web app really makes development and deployment a lot easier. \nWe often host multiple databases in a single rds instance to reduce costs.\nWe get data isolation and don&#x27;t have to deal with sharding, of course this works well for enterprise applications with just 50 - 100 tenants."],"time":["2020-08-31 09:47:08"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["lukevp"],"id":[24325922],"kids":{},"parent":[24324142],"text":["It’s really best to design everything for a shared app shared db model, and to have a user&#x2F;tenant heirarchy in every app. You can start with each user belonging to their own tenant.

At its core, we received events (5-10KB) from customers and did something with those events. In total, we were receiving 8K-10K events per second.<p>In terms of security and privacy, isolating an individual tenant from others wasn&#x27;t so much of a concern as each tenant was a customer within the organization with the same data classification level. So from a security perspective, we were &quot;okay&quot;.<p>Where this gets interesting is that one tenant would suddenly decide to push a massive volume of data. Now processing events within a specific SLA was a critical non-functional requirement with this system. So then our on-call engineers would get alerts because shared messaging queues were getting backed up since Mr. Bob had decided to give us 3-5x his typical volume.<p>The traffic spike from one customer, which could last from minutes to hours, would negatively impact our SLAs with the other customers. Now all the customers would be upset. ^_0<p>Being internal customers, they were willing to pay for the excess traffic, but we didn&#x27;t really have the tooling to auto scale. Our customers also didn&#x27;t want us to rate limit them. Their expectation was that when they have traffic spikes, we need to be able to deal with it.<p>Now – we didn&#x27;t want to run extra machines that sat idle like 90% of the time. And when we had these traffic spikes, we&#x27;d see our metrics and find maxed out CPU, memory, and even worse, we&#x27;d consume all disk space from the log volume on the machines filling everything up. The hosts would become zombies until someone logged in and manually freed up disk.<p>There were a few lessons learned:<p>1. Rate limit your customers (if your organization allows).<p>2. If your customers are adamant that in some instances each month, they need to be able to send you 5x the traffic without any notice, then you can&#x27;t just rate limit them and be done with it. We adopted a solution where we would let our queues back up while some monitors would detect the excessive CPU or memory usage and would start scaling out the infrastructure. Once our monitors saw the message queues were looking normal again, they&#x27;d wait a little while and then scale back down.<p>3. When you&#x27;re processing from a message queue, you need to capture metrics to track which customer is sending you what volume. Otherwise, you can have metrics on the message queues themselves and have one queue per customer.<p>4. If it&#x27;s a matter of life and death (it wasn&#x27;t, but that&#x27;s how one customer described it), something you can do is stop logging when disk space usage exceeds a specific amount.<p>5.

Real companies cannot afford to do research other than monopolies. And there are some famous ones. The telephone monopoly — Bell Labs. The computer monopoly — Watson Labs. The copier monopoly — Xerox Parc. And on it goes. In retrospect the monopolies aren&#x27;t worth it for the research they do. It&#x27;s nauseating how much we hear about how cool Bell Labs was, but other than the transistor and Unix and the princess telephone, what did we get for all that money? And then for years AT&amp;T as a monopoly sat on innovation — and IBM after that, and Xerox after that — it&#x27;s just not worth it, so let&#x27;s kill those monopolies.  And if we need research, have it done at research universities. And the other spin I would offer there: as a practitioner of technological innovation, I worry about technology transfer — how do you get technology transferred from the lab into the marketplace. And the best way to do that is with people; and it is the business of universities to graduate people. So let&#x27;s do our research there, and I think the ARPANet is a great example where government financed the research.<p>Source: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;zKz07DdaKzw?t=3772\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;zKz07DdaKzw?t=3772<\/a>"],"time":["2020-08-30 14:58:42"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Ozzie_osman"],"id":[24323471],"kids":{},"parent":[24321799],"text":["&gt; No one is quite sure why the lab model failed.

In the most successful cases we don&#x27;t even really perceive it as an R&amp;D lab because the entire company is doing R&amp;D constantly, in a completely integrated manner.<p>Google is perhaps the clearest case of a company that has completely integrated R&amp;D with its operations. There is an org called Google Research but IIRC it existed mostly for a trophy hire and isn&#x27;t especially important: the bulk of actual research is&#x2F;was done by product teams as an integrated part of their development process. There is no lab, yet at the same time, the lab is everywhere.<p>The second aspect is that it doesn&#x27;t discuss the role of personality or personal visions of CEOs at all. Yet this is often critical to the decision to do R&amp;D.<p>Why does Google research AI? It&#x27;s <i>not<\/i> because it&#x27;s an obvious, slam dunk move. Google has been doing ML research since the very start of the firm, but other search engine firms didn&#x27;t. Why did Google research Google Glass? Or self driving cars? Google researches these things because Larry and Sergey thought it was cool. Page has even claimed in the past Google was founded specifically to do AI research (which isn&#x27;t really right, but whatever).<p>What about SpaceX? Tesla? The Boring Company? Neuralink? These firms exist and do R&amp;D because Elon Musk is a futurist. He doesn&#x27;t do R&amp;D for economic reasons, let alone for regulatory reasons. He does it because he wants to invent the future.<p>But this type of personality is rare. Our society is not kind to futurists. It doesn&#x27;t really value them. They&#x27;re seen as strange or dangerous; the story of inventing new technologies is usually a story of being attacked on all sides, by journalists or politicians or regulators or all of them at once. That&#x27;s why most companies set up &quot;innovation teams&quot; - the exact opposite of the approach taken by the most innovative companies. They&#x27;re little silos where people are taken and put in a corner, then told &quot;go innovate&quot;. The non-technical CEO has no interest in the innovation team and likely never talks to them directly, let alone gives them direction or ideas. The team members know this and usually just mimic whatever trends they see around them (IoT, blockchain, AI, cloud, etc). Their projects are usually doomed from the start.<p>In the end, for research to be valued people with the power to deploy it must be excited by technology, not intimidated by it. And that isn&#x27;t most corporate or government leaders today."],"time":["2020-08-30 20:24:49"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["davidtgoldblatt"],"id":[24323899],"kids":[24324008,24324223],"parent":[24314448],"text":["Of particular interest is section 20.18 -- &quot;Mirroring memory operands&quot;; extending (something like) register renaming to memory."],"time":["2020-08-30 18:34:37"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["enchiridion"],"id":[24325105],"kids":{},"parent":[24314448],"text":["Can anyone comment on how secure this architecture is against speculative execution attacks vs. Intel?"],"time":["2020-08-30 21:10:05"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Reelin"],"id":[24328779],"kids":[24328975],"parent":[24314448],"text":["I have a (likely silly) question for anyone well versed in low level CPU stuff. §20.7 says there&#x27;s a stack engine that optimizes manipulation of the stack pointer.

There is probably a huge demand for data driven decision making for restaurants rather than these spares studies mentioned in the article which most likely are anecdotal. Simply have four different menus with the same items and look at the analytics provided by point of sale system. That is a fun start - up idea.<p>Most of your favorite restaurants in places like San Francisco, Portland, and New York City engineer their menu by removing least popular menu items once a month or once a season and replace them with what they think their customers currently demand at a price to insure that the restaurant is running at the point of highest efficiency. There are other considerations such a cost of product but most restaurants increase overall demand by using analytics from the point of sale system and the most profitable dishes are not always the most popular. Engineering a kitchen -- and dining room for that matter -- to be efficient without cooks tripping over each other is another whole discussion nonetheless even this ties into what can be added to the menu.<p>The two biggest mistakes an independent restaurant can make is hard coding a menu and putting the word in Bistro or Basserie in the restaurant name -- the restaurant can&#x27;t evolve after that.

Hire entire team for the purpose of the project, ensure they know most of them will be let go before the project end and ensure they have no vested interest in the success of the project. Provide as little actual guidance on how the problem is to be solved, only very general requirements. Let the team self-organize. Don&#x27;t supervise (your time too precious, remember?) and only ever involve in discussion about high-level architectural concepts. Expect the application to be delivered to PROD on time regardless of the state and the missing features to be substituted with workarounds.<p>2. Not happy with quality of the code? Start a rewrite without a good idea on why exactly you are doing the rewrite, what you want to achieve or how you are going to do it. Decide to slowly migrate functionality from the old service to the new one using strangler pattern. Don&#x27;t get buy in from your stakeholders. Annoy them with requests for more staff while delaying development of critical features and creating more and more incidents. Eventually put the migration on hold having multiple services with unclear boundaries, copies of functionality, nonexistent documentation and new development team because the old got fed up with your bullshit.<p>3. Accept government contract to move 10 messages from webservice to a mainframe. Ensure you need 5 different features when processing moving the data.

With different exceptions leading to entirely different flows. On C you can use setjmp&#x2F;longjmp + globals for a similar effect. This will help the maintenance programmer develop thinking in multiple dimensions.<p>- To save space, do not declare separate constants for every magic number&#x2F;string. Instead use one large constant pooling all the constants, and then deduce the other constants from parts of the one large constant. You&#x27;ll be teaching the maintenance programmer an advanced optimization technique.<p>- Abuse localization rules whenever a case-insensitive operation is operated (e.g. Turkish i, German eszett, etc.). You&#x27;ll be broadening the mind of the maintenance programmer, teaching cultural differences.<p>For extra points, when dealing with fixed string constants in the code, abuse Unicode&#x27;s right-to-left rules to make the shown data rather different than the actual data the compiler sees, and zero width characters the make the shown length different than the actual length. This is particular useful with the &quot;one large constant technique&quot; from above.<p>- Do use locals when the locals shadow the global variable. This will teach the maintenance programmer to pay attention.<p>- Supply more precise overrides in files&#x2F;projects included in partial compilation as to make code that will behave differently depending on compilation order, included files&#x2F;projects, etc. This will help teach the importance of a build system.<p>Bonus points if the included code is actually similar, but relies on subtle differences in the behaviour of a previous version of the framework or included packages."],"time":["2020-08-31 02:14:09"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["dang"],"id":[24328724],"kids":{},"parent":[24325974],"text":["These seem to be the interesting previous threads—let me know if I missed one...<p>2018 <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=17781475\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=17781475<\/a><p>2016 <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=12188236\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=12188236<\/a><p>2016 <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=12165878\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=12165878<\/a><p>2015 (different article, same title) <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=10237636\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=10237636<\/a><p>2015 <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=9602743\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=9602743<\/a><p>2013 <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=6849532\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=6849532<\/a><p>2012 (a bit) <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=4717912\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=4717912<\/a><p>2010 (a bit) <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=1573034\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=1573034<\/a><p>2009 <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=637491\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=637491<\/a><p>As for the year, 2003 is an upper bound given <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20030626161523&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mindprod.com&#x2F;unmain.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20030626161523&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mindpr...<\/a>.

One easy way of adding more of an end game now is to do something like factorio and make upgrading the keep really expensive - you could have a couple of more advanced upgrades that require a lot of gold and glass for example. This would make the player need to harvest the full map. (2) deleting roads got really slow on a full map. (3) I clicked on the menu screen by accident frequently, but clicking on the menu again doesn&#x27;t close it (you have to go to &quot;return to game&quot;). If you could make clicking on it again close that would be great. (4) the one thing that was a bit challenging is not knowing what my resource limits are. Adding resource limits as small text under the amount I have now would be really helpful.<p>As a future game design, it could be fun to add a public health element - homes can get the plague, and you have to build wells for clean water, morgues, parks, etc. If you build too dense, the plague spreads faster, but you also have a productive city. It would add a dynamic of having to carefully plan where you build roads and, as a result how dense you want your housing to be. A worksite could be plagued just like a house, and then wouldn&#x27;t produce resources.

If we&#x27;re talking about 0days that allow message decryption from a MITM, this is true--but if we&#x27;re talking about RCE with (on mobile OSes) a local sandbox escape (e.g. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threatpost.com&#x2F;whatsapp-zero-day-exploited-in-targeted-spyware-attacks&#x2F;144696&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threatpost.com&#x2F;whatsapp-zero-day-exploited-in-target...<\/a>), then installing more apps <i>increases<\/i> the attack surface and thus the risk.<p>* Another argument for multiple services seems to be some implied DOS resistance. But of course exactly the opposite is true: if you split your message and deliver it via multiple channels, any one of those channels can be taken offline and thus thwart message delivery.<p>* The real argument for multiple services seems to be based on an assumed threat model of an attacker who primarily relies on lawful intercept orders, <i>not<\/i> on technical capabilities (e.g., a warrant, not cryptanalysis). Adding multiple services may do little or nothing for the latter threat, since many messaging services rely on the same underlying protocols (e.g. the Signal Protocol) or the same crypto primitives. This is important for my next point:<p>* If the threat model is about lawful intercepts, and you actually trust modern crypto, this entire scheme makes no sense. Just share a public key for a common, well-vetted algorithm. Encrypting messages using an air-gapped device makes sense.<p>* Further, if we trust crypto, this scheme&#x27;s sole value is effectively in contact (or public key) discovery: assuming you can&#x27;t meet face-to-face, the point of this scheme is really to allow multiple services to help you discover a contact&#x27;s public key (assuming we replace the unnecessary OTP approach with public key exchanges). But many (most?) of these services rely on the telephone system for identity--so there&#x27;s still a fairly trivial single point of failure, commonly controlled by the government.<p>* To beat a dead horse: if we don&#x27;t trust modern crypto, it&#x27;s likely an adversary can access all components of the message+OTP anyway (even without lawful intercept capabilities), so this scheme adds no value.<p>Summary:<p>This proposal would benefit by a more clearly stated threat model.

We do not even think of questioning what the narrator tells us. Even mystery or suspense stories only hide a secret with the protagonist &quot;peeling an onion&quot; to find answers progressively. Deceptive incidents, the doubts of the detective, inconsequential objects, descriptions of crime scenes serve to distract us and we know we are being distracted and it is part of the game.<p>But unreliable narrators are a different beast altogether. As the story progresses, there are hints of doubt created in our minds regarding description of events, feelings of characters, gaps in some story lines which we hope will be reconciled later (and which are). A great author can do this so subtly that if you do not follow along closely it is easy to miss or, worse, mistake this to be a problem with the author&#x27;s storytelling.<p>Fight Club is one such story. It is non-linear which serves to disorient the reader and at the end we realize the narrator was also unreliable. There are sentences like &quot;Today I almost ate Marla&#x27;s mother&quot; and we are left wondering what that means until a few paragraphs later it is revealed.

For example, I love the history of semiconductor development, but simultaneously, I also recognize that a large number of semiconductor fabs in the 1970s operated by Intel, AMD, Fairchild, HP, National, Commodore, etc, are now superfund sites. At many sites, cleanup works are still ongoing today. And usually it was not a result of malice, but inexperience - many operational and regulatory safeguards were simply not established - in fact, many leaks were only discovered decades later. I summarized some of these incidents in a HN commment at [0] if you are interested.<p>Following the same line of thought, I wonder how dangerous dust-scale computing is, biologically and environmentally. In general, there are a lot of ongoing research projects on the safety of nanomaterials, and have already showed the potential hazards cannot be ignored [1]. In the particular case, it appears to be just a relatively conventional MEMS chip that we are familiar with, not some radically new and different nanomaterials, so [1] doesn&#x27;t apply here, but the question of &quot;what will happen if these chips enter the environment (air, soil, water) and biosphere&quot; remains, especially if these are going to be used at an industrial scale, and will be intentionally introduced to the environment for remote sensing.

Prices and wages are extremely flexible in Albania; as a result, the government was able to cut real public sector wages substantially in 1997 (by leaving nominal wages unchanged), and the economy suffered no loss of competitiveness when the lek appreciated. The new government’s willingness to tackle the budget deficit and undertake long-overdue structural reforms was also crucial. However, the social effects were profound.

If you do have to do these tasks - you guessed it - it should be part of the same experimentation platform you are using.<p>3. Research MLOps (ResOps?): Did I say experimentation platform? Any team member should be able to work as she wishes -  Notebooks, scripts, whatnot. And if you forget to commit something before you run? You want to know about all the changes. Sharing? Comparing? - must have.  Reproducible experimentation? Need to be able to automatically track environment variables, packages installed etc. Most importantly - Need to be able to offload to the cluster in the same running environment with a button click. I am not going to spend hours deciphering logs to find out that the wrong version of package was installed in our container.

We shipped <i>many<\/i> projects and it can be taxing to work on different stacks, especially given the fact that we built for enterprise and they always want <i>complete<\/i> solutions. The model is but a foot in the door, and you must do custom front-end&#x2F;back-end&#x2F;model&#x2F;pipe&#x2F;data acquisition.<p>We decided to build tooling around that workflow. We shipped and were paid with that workflow, so we wanted to make it efficient and effective. Other solutions didn&#x27;t fit our needs. Straight out of <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;927&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;927&#x2F;<\/a>, except it needs to address <i>our<\/i> use cases. We backtest with our past projects and use it for our current ones to scale our consulting capabilities.<p>&gt;<i>- standardizing end to end tooling for special resources, eg queueing and batching to keep utilization high for production GPU systems, high RAM use cases like approximate nearest neighbor indexes, and just run of the mill stuff like how to take a trained model and deploy it behind a microservice in a way that bakes in logging, tracing, alerting, and more.<\/i><p>We do schedule notebooks[1]. We also publish AppBooks[2], which are automatically parametrized notebooks: it automatically generates a form so anyone can set variables the notebook author&#x27;s chose to expose and run a notebook without changing the code. Extremely useful when you want to have a domain expert tweak a domain specific variable, without them having to know what a notebook is. In some projects, there&#x27;s someone with deep, deep expertise in a field for whom a variable is really important, but that variable gets dismissed by the ML practitioner because they didn&#x27;t see a correlation or an impact on AUC or something, so the domain expert has an input, whether on relevant variables, or the <i>real<\/i> world metrics we&#x27;re working for. We also added instrumentation for the basic CPU&#x2F;RAM&#x2F;GPU, data, servers running, etc. Again, so that our teammates don&#x27;t bother with this. We use different Docker images for notebook servers with some that are 30GB so members don&#x27;t bother with dependencies, GPU&#x2F;tensorflow&#x2F;cuda and version conflicts.<p>We automatically track metrics and parameters without the notebook&#x27;s author writing boilerplate code, because they forget. The models are saved, and the ML practitioner can click on a button to deploy a model[3]. We stressed a lot on self service because its absense put a lot of stress on us: an ML practitioner wants to deploy a model, asks someone in the team who&#x27;s probably busy. So we said: anyone should click and deploy. This is also useful because a developer downstream will only need to send in HTTP requests to interact with the model. We used to have application developers who also needed to know more than they should have on the internals&#x2F;dependencies of the models. Not anymore.<p>We also added near real-time collaboration&#x2F;editing so many people can work on the same notebook, especially useful when a team member is struggling to implement something, and others chime in to help debug&#x2F;refactor, and review[4]. Everyone sees everyone&#x27;s cursor for better awareness of what&#x27;s being done. A use case is an ML practitioner playing with a paper who&#x27;s struggling on the algorithms or data structures part of the paper. They can sollicit another team member who&#x27;ll chime in and help. One of the features that&#x27;s useful is the multiple checkpoints[5], which allows one to revert to an arbitrary checkpoint, not just the last one. This, again, is porcelain because an ML practitioner playing with git is a context switch, and they don&#x27;t really like it.<p>So, we&#x27;ve done a few things to make our life easier. The workflow isn&#x27;t perfect, and the tools aren&#x27;t perfect, but we&#x27;re removing friction.<p>We add applications for the usual timeseries forecasting, sentiment analysis, anomaly detection, churn, to leverage projects we did in the past.<p>[0]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iko.ai\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iko.ai<\/a><p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iko.ai&#x2F;docs&#x2F;notebook&#x2F;#long-running-notebooks\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iko.ai&#x2F;docs&#x2F;notebook&#x2F;#long-running-notebooks<\/a><p>[2]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iko.ai&#x2F;docs&#x2F;appbook&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iko.ai&#x2F;docs&#x2F;appbook&#x2F;<\/a><p>[3]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iko.ai&#x2F;docs&#x2F;appbook&#x2F;#deploying-a-model\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iko.ai&#x2F;docs&#x2F;appbook&#x2F;#deploying-a-model<\/a><p>[4]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iko.ai&#x2F;docs&#x2F;notebook&#x2F;#collaboration\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iko.ai&#x2F;docs&#x2F;notebook&#x2F;#collaboration<\/a><p>[5]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iko.ai&#x2F;docs&#x2F;notebook&#x2F;#multiple-checkpoints\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iko.ai&#x2F;docs&#x2F;notebook&#x2F;#multiple-checkpoints<\/a>"],"time":["2020-08-30 21:08:06"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["whatsmyusername"],"id":[24324499],"kids":{},"parent":[24323778],"text":["Have you actually negotiated or engaged with the platform team?

Here is a link to ACM Digital Library (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dl.acm.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;abs&#x2F;10.1145&#x2F;3313831.3376585\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dl.acm.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;abs&#x2F;10.1145&#x2F;3313831.3376585<\/a>) and a PDF copy of the paper on my Box account (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cmu.box.com&#x2F;s&#x2F;89iugeaf3hcc51ir9f4akrp1a9b0mogd\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cmu.box.com&#x2F;s&#x2F;89iugeaf3hcc51ir9f4akrp1a9b0mogd<\/a>).<p>One of the things we did was a survey of N=226 AirBnB users. 86 people said that they manually searched for devices in AirBnBs, and 8 actually found undisclosed devices. As you might imagine, manually searching is hard because devices are small, but also because you don&#x27;t always know if you&#x27;ve found everything, and because it looks socially awkward too.<p>People also reported on how they looked for devices, ranging from manual search (most common) to using WiFi &#x2F; Bluetooth scanning tools. Here is an excerpt from our paper as to what people said they did.<p><i>11 (13%) tech-savvy participants used special tools to help search, such as using a phone camera or flashlight, scanning Bluetooth and the Wi-Fi network, and using an infrared scanner. For example, participants reported that they turned off all the lights and used their smartphone flashlight to shine around the area and look for reflections that might indicate a camera lens. Some participants reported that their smartphone cameras did not have an infrared filter, and so they could detect invisible infrared light emitted by cameras. Other participants reported using smartphone apps, such as Fing and iNet, to detect suspicious devices connecting to the network. Two participants brought RF signal detectors to scan the room for the source of RF signals (cameras). However, these methods require a strong technical background, and the devices might not be cheap (e.g., over $100 USD on Amazon for a popular RF signal detector).<\/i><p>The main point of the paper, though, is to look at ways for IoT device manufacturers to help physically locate devices. We called these IoT Locators. An example might be to have devices blink or beep. It&#x27;s trying to address the physical layer of privacy, to help people have more awareness of what&#x27;s nearby and where these devices are. The logical layer might tell you that there&#x27;s a camera nearby, but we also wanted to help people find those devices and see (for example) where those cameras might be pointed. There&#x27;s a big difference between a camera in an AirBnb that is pointed toward the living room versus pointed out the window, something that isn&#x27;t captured just by knowing that a camera is nearby.<p>There&#x27;s lots of limitations, for example needing lots of standards among device manufacturers and how to incentivize them to install things like these in devices. I would say the main idea, though, is that we need to really think more about the physical dimensions of privacy (which has been underlooked in research and industry), and that we need to think more about how to help hotels, AirBnBs, and device manufacturers that do want to do better on privacy w.r.t devices, but don&#x27;t know what to do."],"time":["2020-08-30 21:00:54"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["filleokus"],"id":[24325409],"kids":[24325494],"parent":[24324300],"text":["How costly are these cameras?

If the company has dysfunctional elements to its corporate culture, depending on the size, it&#x27;s quite likely they&#x27;ll be surfaced here. Not only is this one of the first impressions of you for them, but it&#x27;s one of the first impressions of them for you. Pay attention to what your gut and intuition tell you here. Every time I&#x27;ve broken this rule, it&#x27;s bitten me.<p>For my second point, I think that people often forget that the only way to get better at interviewing is to just do it over and over again. It&#x27;s a little hard to do that in a synthetic environment because it&#x27;s hard to trick your brain into behaving as if it is real unless it actually is. But wait, you may say, treating an interview like practice is unethical! But I&#x27;d disagree. After all, if you really do well on the interview but you&#x27;re not chomping at the bit to join, they might be more willing to negotiate and make you an offer that would make you reconsider. But, you likely know (and can force-rank) the roles you&#x27;d be most willing and least willing to take if you had the opportunity, so make sure to go through the sequence from least desirable to most desirable so that you have more leverage.<p>My third point is probably the most crucial. You need the BATNA (best alternative to negotatiated agreement) of accepting something else or staying where you are to be able to negotiate. Otherwise, you have much less leverage. This is part of why timing and interviewing for less desirable roles is preferable, because you are more likely to negotiate with an offer for your more desirable role by the time you get there."],"time":["2020-08-30 18:22:32"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["rsecora"],"id":[24324040],"kids":[24324212],"parent":[24323579],"text":["Another of the most common errors is to lie or to exaggerate in a side work experience.

Then got an enterprise level 2 support role (providing support to network admins). In the company for 12 years and counting - changed roles 4 times. Learned to code writing support tools (PHP and HTML) eventually learned JS also, turned out I was really really good at it and now I’m writing infrastructure code for one of the product groups.<p>My advice would be to learn the lower levels of the stack - networking at the protocol level, Linux, SQL without ORMs, vanilla programming with no frameworks until you start writing your own at which point pick the best on the market. Learn to run your code in a Docker container.<p>Passion, integrity, obsession with delivering results are very valuable - cultivate these and market them to the best of your ability. Be the person that steps up to do boring jobs that help other people - I volunteered to run our server lab that was used by other engineers and wrote some tooling to do things faster. Eventually people notice and you will learn a lot.<p>Avoid shift work like the plague it is and do your best to limit on-call exposure.<p>I like my job - it pays well enough and at my senior level offers plenty of flexibility for managing my time and what I work on."],"time":["2020-08-31 00:04:35"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["radiowalker"],"id":[24326271],"kids":{},"parent":[24325548],"text":["- I got into the field because in my previous career (bank compliance), I spent an inordinate amount of time gathering data and summarizing it.

Update excel sheet X times every X days, etc. You soon want to automate the boring repetitive stuff but formulas in excel only get you so far. So you reach to VBA that exposes you more to coding.

Hiring is predominantly based on obscure algorithm and data structure problems, things that 99% of people don&#x27;t care about in their day-to-day job.

To advertise the offer, I wanted to customize the welcome message you get after connecting to a server. It&#x27;s coded in HTML&#x2F;CSS which I had known nothing about so I asked my ICT teacher, who happened to build websites as a side job at the time, if he could help me with that. He taught me the basics, pushed me in the right direction whenever I had a problem and showed me programming is a ton of fun. So from the welcome message, we moved onto building dynamic websites in PHP... Then games in C# using MonoGame. Then came my first professional jobs - CMSs, CRMs, first Java backends and so.

So I started dabbling with Macromedia Director (predecessor to Flash for making CD-ROMS [when that was a thing]), then flash, and then HTML and kept going farther and farther back in the stack. This was in the time of PERL and ASP, and I&#x27;d devour O&#x27;Riley books trying to learn as much as I possibly could. A book on regex. A book on data structors.

At the last company, I was incredibly fortunate to have the architect take me under his wing and have daily master&#x2F;apprentice style problems and reviews with me.

Then I told my managers that I could be a full-time force multiplier instead of a single-unit contributor (in other words, generating more value for the company) and they liked that idea and what I&#x27;d done so far so they helped me transition pretty quick. I continued working in support tools development for a couple of years and really enjoyed it.<p>There&#x27;s a footnote here that I moved from the US to Europe because labor laws are more relaxed here so I was able to code for work for free on my own time without there being an issue, which I needed in order to show what I could do for the company to get that initial foot in the door for the support tools dev position. In the US, they told me they couldn&#x27;t let me work for free (I suspect because of the Fair Labor Standards Act, but I never asked) so I requested and got a transfer.<p>Now I work on anti-cheat software for games.

Then make software to make you better at doing that. Don&#x27;t wait for someone to give you permission, because they won&#x27;t (and this continues to be a rule even after you &quot;make it&quot; - continue jockeying for what you want and don&#x27;t wait for permission unless there&#x27;s no other way). If you show (with actual live code) that you&#x27;re a force multiplier at your company&#x27;s thing using code and they&#x27;re in a position to hire someone for that work, then make your case for why you&#x27;re that someone to whoever has the power to make it happen for you. It doesn&#x27;t even have to matter if they don&#x27;t hire SWEs. You can negotiate contract work if you have to.

In high school learned some C and C++, but once the internet became more accessible moved onto web based languages. After graduating high school, mostly due to having no guidance what so ever, I never put together in my head that I could pursue programming as a legitimate career, walking around with a 16 inch green mohawk pretty much guaranteed that I was labeled a lost cause.<p>I did a short stint in the Army, ended up in a minor touring punk band till about my mid-20&#x27;s. Decided that I wanted to pursue something different after realizing the band was a one way ticket to a dead end. I got the brilliant idea to pursue photojournalism. My timing was impeccable. As I was finishing the &quot;great newspaper crash&quot; had started and after working freelance for a few years I started a small photographic advertising firm. But... during all this I was still coding. This was in the early days of what was being called &quot;New Media.&quot; A lot of the places I was working with, the older journalists were not interested in how to use the web for better story telling. I didn&#x27;t hesitate to get my hands dirty creating web sites for stories, working with flash to create interactive pieces, etc.<p>When I started the advertising firm, a client asked me if I could create a website for their business. Never being one to pass on the chance to make a few bucks, I confidently said &quot;Yes&quot; and proceeded to learn PHP and WordPress as fast as possible.<p>Around this time I also took the plunge and got married, which ended rather quickly in divorce. I decided to give up my rights to anything we accumulated during our marriage and was living on my friend&#x27;s couch just trying to get a fresh start. A friend told me about a company his partner worked for that was looking for a developer. With her reference and the pressure of being homeless and hungry, I was able to land a gig as the companies &quot;Web Master&quot; (yeah, they were still using that title lol). The company was sold and the purchaser had their own team and cut the local team to the bones so I started freelancing.<p>My tips?\n- Most developers and SWEs are just as clueless as you even if they have a degree, don&#x27;t be intimidated.\n- Realize that as a self-learner, you have an advantage of knowing how to learn quickly and efficiently.\n- Don&#x27;t make money a priority, salaries for the most part are a side effect if you love what you do.\n- Realize you need a break sometimes, burn out is real and will kick your behind if left unchecked (as my own failure of my first tip, I always am dealing with imposter syndrome which leads me to constantly spending even my off time trying to learn more so that my co-workers don&#x27;t ever say anything negative about me being self-taught)\n- Ignore trends and just follow what you enjoy doing or this will quickly become &quot;work&quot;. In my own recent experience, I&#x27;ve been feeling the pressure about moving into ML&#x2F;AI. After a nice long think these last few months as I end my first decade in this field I realized I have no interest in it, I just like building software. Coming to terms with that has done wonders in my mental state and brought a lot of inner peace.<p>Eventually a friend told me about a gig as a developer with an F500 energy company and helped me get my foot in the door. Worked my way up from a junior SWE to a lead position. I&#x27;ve now moved a few times and am now working in a financial company that is a major player in the world economy. Not because I think it will change much other than making me a better engineer, I&#x27;ve recently returned to school to get my CS degree and am preparing for another pivot into other areas of development once I&#x27;m done.<p>All in all, it wasn&#x27;t the life track I expected.

So I ended up making a website for one of our events, linking it with google payments etc, promoting it on facebook via a video shared among local groups, and it registered people, kind of like what eventbrite does now.

So that experience exposed me to some of the cool things I could do with my web skills and I focused more intensively on learning to program more.<p>That landed me my first software engineering internship my Junior year, where although I had no experience with the backend programming language that they used I was able to pick it up and ship a finished admin client by the end of the internship. I was offered a full-time position as a software engineer at the completion of the internship, although I did not have a CS &#x2F; SWE degree. However, one thing that I discovered about myself during the internship was that working a desk job all day made me very depressed. Aside from QA sessions and design briefings with management I hardly interacted with people during my internship, due to the nature of the engineering job. And it felt like taking the job would be me sitting behind a desk in front of a computer all day for the rest of my life, not really interacting with many people... and for some reason that was very depressing and unsettling to me, personally. So instead of seeking employment I decided to go the freelance &#x2F; consultant route, and try to build my own clientele.<p>It took ~4 years to actually get any real consulting traction though. Partly due to some false starts in startup land... So I’m not sure if I would recommend it. I think for many people, the happy ending would have been getting a full time offer before graduating college. And the advice there for someone in their early 20’s would just be to network, get involved in things, build a portfolio, and seek out internships. An internship is basically an extended interview with a potential full time job offer on the other end... But unfortunately my particulars made that somehow undesirable, and so I decided to go the hard way.<p>Today I consult with business owners and partner with design agencies, helping businesses in e-commerce bring their business requirements to life. Sometimes it’s just giving general advice on how to build stuff, what they should be considering during the design process, and the rest of the time it’s programming. It’s all remote. Although many people have given remote work a thumbs down during the pandemic, I’m happy with the flexibility."],"time":["2020-08-31 19:09:44"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[24329322],"kids":{},"parent":[24325548],"text":{},"time":["2020-08-31 09:52:51"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":["adrusi"],"id":[24326835],"kids":{},"parent":[24325548],"text":["<i>Why did you get into the field?

I got some relevant work experience in college, first working quarter-time for a startup writing node js libraries, then working for my university&#x27;s CS department as a sysadmin.

Back then I was on AOL and hackers made “progz” which added functionality on top of the platform. I was curious how they did made them and wanted to make one myself. So my father took me to compusa to talk to someone about programming. I left with a cd to install Visual Basic and a learn vb in 24 hours book. From there I spent a good portion of my childhood learning various languages, platforms, philosophies, and frameworks.<p>The first money I made was building ASP classic websites for local businesses when I was around 17. In college I started as a CS major but at the time the curriculum hadn’t caught up to the web and I wasn’t interested in what they were teaching. I was always a pretty entrepreneurial, so I transferred to the business program.<p>I try not to have regrets, but in hindsight I wish I followed  through with CS. It took me many years and a large investment of time to build the required fundamentals I think every software engineer should have. Also, all that stuff they were teaching later become interesting to me.<p>After I graduated I wanted to be a product manager. But no one would hire me and they kept pushing me towards software development. I decided if I was going to write software for a living I had to go work somewhere fun. So my first job was at CollegeHumor as a software engineer. It was the perfect transition from college to the real world. We worked hard and we had a tremendous amount of fun too.<p>Early in my career I had a chance to go into management and have mostly stayed in management since. I still program (outside the critical path), contribute to architecture, and try to keep my skills up to date and sharp.<p>I’ve joined various companies early enough where I’ve been the first engineering hire. I’ve had the chance to develop everything from scratch and then build a team to hand it off to. I’ve also joined mid stage startups and helped grow the team and tech.<p>I love what I do.<p>My advice...<p>- Do it because you love it. The best engineers I’ve worked with also happen to be the most passionate. They are curious and never stop learning.<p>- Learn CS fundamentals and how the things you use work under the hood<p>- Learn to create value for a business. Unless you are in academia or research you are being paid to create value for the business. I can’t believe how many engineers miss this point. This means that you should forget the pursuit of perfection and learn to balance good enough and technical debt.<p>- Learn how to speak to software people and business people. You’ll be more valuable if you can translate and be the bridge to both sides.<p>- Experiment with lots of different languages, philosophies, and paradigms. You’ll find the ones you like and take some lessons away from all of them.<p>- Dont get caught up chasing the next hot thing (language, framework, database, etc). At the same time don’t become obsolete either.<p>- Learn SQL. Really learn it. I’m not talking about the little bit to make your ORM work. A database is just another service you interact with. You should know what value it brings and how to interact with it.<p>- Money is good. Most people in this perfession seem to be doing okay. But don’t do it just for the money.<p>- If you plan to join a startup learn about Stock options and how they work. It’s amazing how many engineers work at startups and have no idea about their options and how it fits in as part of their comp package."],"time":["2020-08-31 00:34:40"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["j_rosenthal"],"id":[24326470],"kids":{},"parent":[24325548],"text":["Self trained SWE here.

What did you focus on at first?<p>It was kind of an accident.  Archaeology is inherently destructive, so data management is pretty important.  I&#x27;d always been on the data and mapping side.  I wound up in a data production&#x2F;management role at a government agency.  We had a web mapping product delivered that didn&#x27;t do what we needed, and it landed on my desk to figure out if we could use it to improve our internal workflows... and so I fiddled and read, and fiddled and watched Doug Crockford&#x27;s videos, and fiddled and went to see John Resig speak at a meetup... and along the way released multiple little (and eventually big) tools to help my colleagues get stuff done.  3 years later I was speaking at conferences about the technical side of what we were doing, not the archaeological side.  Asking some good questions to a co-panelist in the municipal SaaS space led to more discussions and a job offer.<p>- What are you doing at your job?

I do miss working outside and digging in the dirt though, but definitely enjoy the stability, lack of poison ivy, salary and benefits.<p>- How did you break that first-job barrier?<p>There were two barriers, neither of which I set out to break....  the first barrier was &quot;how did I get the Archaeology job to let me spend time learning and fiddling&quot;, while the second barrier was &quot;how did I get that first job where they actually hired me to do software developent&quot;.  To the first barrier, I built tools.  Tools beget more tools, beget absurd amounts of time saved, which led to bosses willing to let me say &quot;I have an idea, I know its possible, I&#x27;m sure I can build a &quot;good enough&quot; version, I just need time to figure it out.&quot;<p>To the second barrier, I asked questions, I answered questions, I went to lectures and was lucky.<p>- What were you doing before this?<p>Archaeology.

I remember doing more actual programs when we had a PC.  I spent many hours in GW-BASIC and remember creating a simple Space Invaders-like game among other things.<p>Also around middle school age I was getting into Turbo Pascal and starting to teach myself object-oriented programming.  I recommend the book Turbo Pascal Disk Tutor by Werner Fiebel which I had a late edition.<p>When I was around maybe 8th or 9th grade we had started learning algebra and I also my dad had bought this little second-hand 1960s math&#x2F;engineering reference handbook.  I used the equations in there for rotation to create a very simple system for displaying 3D wireframes using Turbo Pascal.  And made it into a really basic type of 3D modeler.<p>In high school I got a later edition of C++ How to Program by Deitel &amp; Deitel.<p>Also my mom was really into reading and brought home a ton of science fiction books many of which I read.  So I think that science fiction also inspired me a bit.<p>College was hard for me, aside from the programming classes which were easy, and some basic courses that mainly just tested literacy.  And I was not really able to make and keep friends so I ended dropping out.  I actually drove across the country and moved to New York where I hoped I would be able to get a job doing trading in C++ or something.  I feel like I was close to scoring a job with a few interviews but ran out of money and got into data entry and then legal word processing for a few years.  I remember building a workflow&#x2F;job tracking system for one of the offices I was in using Access and VBA and then failing to sell it to the programming department head who felt everything needed to be coded in C++.<p>But anyway it was quite difficult for me to get a career in programming.  I put a lot of time into things like Rent-A-Coder and eventually got a temp job that was semi-technical but not quite programming.  I created a system to help automatically compare multicolumn PDFs which was one of the primary jobs in that department.  That helped me land an actual programming contract.<p>To be honest, I think my lack of a degree or charisma and also a few health problems has all hurt me a bit and I have not really flourished as a computer programmer aside from a few more lucrative contracts.<p>The last several years I have focused on work that I can do remotely and that isn&#x27;t always the highest paying thing.

Either sunrise or noon (or both) have to move. DST is a compromise to keep them from moving too much. But sunrise is a more important time than noon.<p>So I&#x27;ve proposed something I call Sunrise Standard Time. It abolishes DST and splits the 24 primary longitudinal time zones into as many as 120 zones by cutting at the tropics and polar circles. Clocks adjust gradually each day to keep sunrise near 6am. The tropics would follow sunrise at the equator, and the temperate zones (between the tropics and polar circles) would follow sunrise at ~ 30deg N or S. That adjustment is about 1 minute per day.<p>To refine things slightly, sunrise can be fixed at the latitude which divides the population in half in each zone (with the constraint that the N and S zones are mirrored). Those latitudes are approximately: 13.5deg for the tropical zone, 34.5deg for the temperate zones, and 68.5deg for all 2 million people living in the polar zones.<p>A further refinement is to split the per-capita sunrise aberration instead. This pushes the boundaries to slightly higher latitudes. For the temperate zones, the minimum per-capita offset of sunrise from 6am on the solstice is achieved by following sunrise at 37.5deg. That&#x27;s pretty close to Washington DC (39deg), Beijing (40deg), and Tokyo (36deg).<p>I suggest the tropics use the equator for simplicity.<p>SST will improve sun tracking for the vast majority of the world&#x27;s population with no sudden changes. It will also be easier to understand than DST. There are no dates to remember and, because the N and S zones are mirrors, it&#x27;s easy for someone in e.g. New York to understand what&#x27;s going on in Sydney.<p>Supporting links:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;upload.wikimedia.org&#x2F;wikipedia&#x2F;commons&#x2F;e&#x2F;e1&#x2F;Hours_of_daylight_vs_latitude_vs_day_of_year_cmglee.svg\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;upload.wikimedia.org&#x2F;wikipedia&#x2F;commons&#x2F;e&#x2F;e1&#x2F;Hours_of...<\/a><p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;world.andersen.im&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;world.andersen.im&#x2F;<\/a>"],"time":["2020-08-29 05:18:21"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["idoh"],"id":[24312709],"kids":[24313118,24312779],"parent":[24312545],"text":["Either eliminate it (preference) or make it permanent.

It&#x27;s eye-opening to watch people estimate their daily screen time around 30 minutes and then be shocked when their reports come back at 2-3 hours or more.<p>Of course, some amount of leisure activity is necessary throughout the day. It&#x27;s important to not shame people for spending time on things they enjoy (Hacker News, video games, Reddit, Twitter), but it is important that they can be honest with themselves about how much time they&#x27;re spending on those activities.<p>Measuring time spent in leisure activities is the only real way to start closing the feedback loop.

For small matrices MKL only became fast after libxsmm showed the way.  (I don&#x27;t know about libxsmm on current AMD hardware, but it&#x27;s free software you can work on if necessary, like AMD have done with BLIS.)
