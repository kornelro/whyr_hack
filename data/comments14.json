You just provide the name of the project, push to git and GitLab CI will pick it up and do the stuff by the template. Even junior developers in our team are doing that from day one. \n Isn&#x27;t that a future we dream about? If you have too much load it will autoscale pod, if node is overloaded it will autoscale node pool, if you have a memory leak it will restart the app so you can sleep at night. I can provide a million examples that make our 100+ microservices management so much simpler. No Linux kungfu, 0 bash scrips, no SSH,  and interaction with OS, not a single devops role for 15+ developers team.<p>Our management of cluster is just a simple  &quot;add more CPU or memory to this nodepool&quot;, sometimes change a nodepool name for deployment for certain service. All done simple cloud management UI.\nFor those who call microservices fancy stuff. No, we are a startup with fast delivery, deploy cycle. We have tons of subproject , integrations, and our main languages are nodejs, golang and python. Some of these are not good at multi-thread so no way to run it as a monolith. The other one is used only when it&#x27;s needed for high performance. \nSo All together Microservices + Kubernetes + Helm + good CI + proper pubsub gives our backend extremely simple fast cycle of development, delivery, and what&#x27;s important flexibility in terms of language&#x2F;framework&#x2F;version.<p>What is also good is the installation of services. With helm I can install high availability redis setup for free in 5 minutes. The same level of setup will cost you several thousand dollars for devops work and further maintenance and update. With k8s it&#x27;s simple helm install stable&#x2F;redis-ha<p>So yeah, I can totally understand some simple projects don&#x27;t need k8s. I can understand you can build something is Scala and Java slowly but with high quality as a monolith. You don&#x27;t need k8s for 3 services. I can understand some old DevOps don&#x27;t want to learn new things and they complain about a tool that reduces the need of these guys.

All of that could be put in a JSON file, which is far less complex.<p>YAML should not even be needed for Kubernetes. Configuration should be representable in a purely declarative way, instead of making the YAML mess, with all kinds of references and stuff. Perhaps the configuration specification needs to be re-worked. Many projects using YAML feel to me like a configuration trash can, where you just add more and more stuff, which you haven&#x27;t thought about.<p>I once tried moving an already containerized system to Kubernetes for testing, how that would work. It was a nightmare. It was a few years ago, maybe 3 years ago. Documentation was plenty but really sucked. I could not find _any_ documentation of what can be put into that YAML configuration file, what the structure really is. I read tens of pages of documentation, none of it helped me to find, what I needed. Then even to set everything up, to get the Kubernetes running at all also took way too much time and 3 people to figure out and was badly documented. It took multiple hours on at least 2 days. Necessary steps, I still remember, not being listed on one single page in any kind of overview, but somewhere a required step was hidden on another documentation page, that was not even mentioned in the list of steps to take.<p>Finally having set things up, I had a web interface in front of me, where I was supposed to be able to configure pods or something. Only, that I could not configure everything I had in my already containerized system, via that web interface. It seems that this web interface was only meant for the most basic use cases, where one does not need to provide containers with much configuration. My only remaining option was to upload a YAML file, which was undocumented, as far as I could see back then. That&#x27;s were I stopped. A horrible experience and I wish not to have it again.<p>There were also naming issues. There was something called &quot;Helm&quot;. To me that sounds like an Emacs package. But OK I guess we have these naming issues everywhere in software development. Still bugs me though, as it feels like Google pushes down its naming of things into many people&#x27;s minds and sooner or later, most people will associate Google things with names, which have previously meant different things.<p>There were 1 or 2 layers of abstraction in Kubernetes, which I found completely useless for my use-case and wished they were not there, but of course I had to deal with them, as the system is not flexible to allow me to only have layers I need. I just wanted to run my containers on multiple machines, balancing the load and automatically restarting on crashes, you know, all the nice things Erlang offers already for ages.<p>I feel like Kubernetes is the Erlang ecosystem for the poor or uneducated, who&#x27;ve never heard of other ways, with features poorly copied.<p>If I really needed to bring a system to multiple servers and scale and load balance, I&#x27;d rather look into something like Nomad. Seems much simpler and also offers load balancing over multiple machines and can run docker containers and normal applications as well, plus I was able to set it up in less than an hour or so, having to servers in the system."],"time":["2020-05-30 00:17:07"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["courtf"],"id":[23357391],"kids":[23357705,23357526,23358470,23358134,23357965,23358384,23357624,23357472,23357711,23358274,23357871,23357509],"parent":[23354418],"text":["I honestly couldn&#x27;t tell you.<p>What I can tell you, is that the unbelievable bloat in the complexity of our systems is going to bite us in the ass.

Ansible is a very useful abstraction&#x2F;force multiplier for doing ops. If a dedicated conference is a measure of community&#x2F;enthusiasm reaching a fever pitch, it took 4 years for Ansible to reach critical mass. Kubernetes had it&#x27;s first Kubecon in 2015[1] ONE year after it&#x27;s initial release in 2014[2]. Did it reach critical mass 4x quicker than ansible? Maybe, but I think the simpler explanation is that the people who want Kubernetes to succeed know that creating buzz and the <i>appearance<\/i> of widespread adoption and community is more important than it actually being there, as it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Once you have enough onlookers, people motivated to work on open source (i.e. give away labor, time and energy for free) will come improve your project with you, serve as an initial user base, your biggest promoters, all the while strengthening your ecosystem.<p>Another interesting side to this is how thoroughly Kubernetes <i>seems<\/i> to be crushing it&#x27;s competition -- DC&#x2F;OS (Mesos), Nomad and other competition are not fighting a functionality war, they&#x27;re fighting a marketing war. DC&#x2F;OS and Nomad are not obviously worse in function, but certainly don&#x27;t compare when you consider ecosystem size (perceived, if not actual) and brand. It&#x27;s a winner-take-most scenario and tech companies are particularly good at seizing this kind of opportunity. Of course, if you compare the resources of the entities backing these projects, it&#x27;s clear who was going to win the marketing war.<p>In a world of free tiers as a good way to get people locked in, developer evangelists who build essentially propaganda projects (no matter how cool they are), and shrinking attention spans, Kubernetes is a good tool which has marketed itself to greatness. In it&#x27;s wake there are efforts like the CNCF which I struggle to characterize because it&#x27;s hard to differentiate their efforts to standardize from an effort to bureaucratize. I&#x27;m almost certainly blinded by my own cynicism but most of this just doesn&#x27;t feel organic. Big, useful open source software gets world-renowned after years&#x2F;decades of being convenient&#x2F;useful&#x2F;correct&#x2F;etc but Kubernetes (and other projects given the CNCF gold star) seem to be trying to skip this process or at least bootstrap a reputation out of the gate.<p>DevOps traditionally moved much slower -- I can remember what seemed like an age of &quot;salt vs ansible vs chef&quot;, with all three technologies having had lots of times to prove themselves useful. Even the switch to containers instead of VM&#x2F;user based process isolation took more time than Kubernetes has taken to dominate the zeitgeist.<p>[0]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ansible_(software)\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ansible_(software)<\/a><p>[1]: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.voxuspr.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;03&#x2F;what-is-kubecon-its-past-present-and-future\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.voxuspr.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;03&#x2F;what-is-kubecon-its-past-pres...<\/a><p>[2]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Kubernetes\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Kubernetes<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-30 07:36:10"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["foobar_"],"id":[23357349],"kids":{},"parent":[23354418],"text":["The arguments used to consistently market software<p>1.

Instead of using 53 bits to represent 52 bits, use 60 bits, and now you can perform 256 sequential additions with no carrying between words before the carry part saturates and needs to be handled.<p>Somewhat surprisingly, it&#x27;s even possible to use this construction in the context of a quantum computation [2][3]. The reason it&#x27;s surprising is because tacking on additional registers like this can act as an information leakage mechanism (which is an error in a quantum computation). For analogy, you can imagine that if you computed a public key using this trick that you would not be comfortable handing an attacker the registers storing your public key before you removed the carry padding that made the computation faster. But it turns out that if you just initialize the carry padding randomly, subtracting out of the next word at the start to ensure everything sums to the correct result at the end, then you can show that the information leakage and chance-of-bad-overflow is exponentially suppressed in the length of the carry padding. Currently the most efficient known way to implement Shor&#x27;s algorithm uses this technique [4].<p>1: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Carry-save_adder\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Carry-save_adder<\/a><p>2: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;1905.08488\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;1905.08488<\/a><p>3: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;upTipX9yXNg?t=777\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;upTipX9yXNg?t=777<\/a><p>4: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;1905.09749\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;1905.09749<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-29 21:51:03"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["tspiteri"],"id":[23351989],"kids":[23354342,23352839],"parent":[23351007],"text":["&gt; Aside: Why 13 bits instead of 12?

The NLP tasks on which the model was tested include translation, question-answering, cloze tasks, unscrambling words, using novel words in sentences, and performing 3-digit arithmetic.<p>3. The model is tested only in a ZERO-SHOT or FEW-SHOT setting. In other words, for each NLP task, the pretrained model is given text instructions with zero examples, or text instructions with a small number of examples (typically 10 to 100). As with human beings, GPT-3-173B doesn&#x27;t need lots of examples to perform competitively in novel NLP tasks.<p>4.

Beyond that, what does it mean to say it &quot;is&quot; a few-shot learner?<p>On one hand, it&#x27;s literally the same claim in a strict sense.

While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language task from only a few examples or from simple instructions – something which current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3 achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time, we also identify some datasets where GPT-3&#x27;s few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate samples of news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from articles written by humans. We discuss broader societal impacts of this finding and of GPT-3 in general."],"time":["2020-05-29 03:47:58"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["dsign"],"id":[23346798],"kids":{},"parent":[23345379],"text":["With things like this, we will need to change how the media work, and how we read news.

Long answer is harder to stomach, so skip next paragraph:<p>1 - Being early is disadvantage actually. Being early means your bid gets dumped in job poster&#x27;s email along with the others. You want to be 1st (hard to be and you&#x27;ll never have the guarantee even with a fast notification) or let it sit for 24 hours.<p>2 - Rant about not having notifications then answering yourself about using RSS. If RSS is hard for you to make it work then I&#x27;ll have to wonder about the rest of your skills as programmer. Personally I didn&#x27;t like any RSS feed apps out there so I wrote my own, customized to my needs.

A motion filed by the government claimed that doing so would have severe consequences &quot;including the possible suspension of the Section 702 program and potential loss of access to lawfully collected signals intelligence information on foreign intelligence targets&quot;.[2]<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Jewel_v._NSA\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Jewel_v._NSA<\/a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eff.org&#x2F;files&#x2F;2014&#x2F;06&#x2F;05&#x2F;govtemergencymotion.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eff.org&#x2F;files&#x2F;2014&#x2F;06&#x2F;05&#x2F;govtemergencymotion.pdf<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-29 16:37:26"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["nolta"],"id":[23350911],"kids":[23353032,23350947],"parent":[23350120],"text":["Off-topic, but what kind of door lock is shown in this picture?<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;upload.wikimedia.org&#x2F;wikipedia&#x2F;commons&#x2F;8&#x2F;89&#x2F;Room_641A_exterior.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;upload.wikimedia.org&#x2F;wikipedia&#x2F;commons&#x2F;8&#x2F;89&#x2F;Room_641...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-29 17:16:36"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["nayuki"],"id":[23350309],"kids":[23350360,23350396,23356733],"parent":[23350120],"text":["Similar: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=kF4EUM8CwT4\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=kF4EUM8CwT4<\/a> &quot;The Secret Behind the Huge, Windowless Skyscraper in NYC&quot; by Half as Interesting<p>And: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;33_Thomas_Street\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;33_Thomas_Street<\/a> ; <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=21555954\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=21555954<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-29 16:28:26"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["HandstandMick"],"id":[23356383],"kids":{},"parent":[23350120],"text":["The async nature of internet routing, bonding, traffic sharing cold vs hot potato, against the rumoured capabilities of these rooms has always bothered me.\nYou would have to be in a position to decrypt or store both directions of the async flow, then correlate that flow between locations that could be for example an alternative landing station on the other side of the country.\nOr am I completely wrong and are both directions of flow somehow easy to gather or simply not important for the level of detail needed to spy?

To be honest, I don&#x27;t like it for a lot of reasons:<p>1) it&#x27;s not cloud native in the sense that running this on e.g. AWS is an easy and well trodden path. Cloud is left as an exercise to the reader of the documentation and at best vaguely hinted at as a possibility. This is weird because that kind of is the whole point of this product. Sure, it has lots of things that are highly useful in the cloud (like an ECS operator or EMR operator); but the documentation is aimed at python hackers running this on their laptop; all the defaults are aimed at this as well. This is a problem because essentially all of that is wrong for a proper cloud native type environment. We&#x27;ve looked at quite a few third party repos for terraform, kubernetes, cloudformation, etc that try to fix this. Ultimately we ended up spending non trivial amounts of time on devops. Basically, this involved lots of problem solving for things that a combination of wrong, poorly documented, or misguided by default. Also, we&#x27;re not done by a long shot.<p>2) The UX&#x2F;UI is terrible and I don&#x27;t use this word lightly. Think hudson&#x2F;jenkins, 15 years ago (and technically that&#x27;s unfair to good old Hudson because it never was this bad). It&#x27;s a fair comparison because Jenkins kind of is a drop in replacement or at least a significant overlap in feature set. And it arguably has a better ecosystem for things like plugins. Absolutely everything in Airflow requires multiple clicks. Also you&#x27;ll be doing CMD+R a lot as there is no concept of autorefresh. Lots of fiddly icons. And then there&#x27;s this obsession with graphs and this being the most important thing ever. There are two separate graph views, only one of which has useful ways of getting to the logs (which never requires less than 4-5 mouse clicks). And of course the other view is the default under most links so you have to learn to click the tiny graph icon to get to the good stuff.<p>3) A lot of the defaults are wrong&#x2F;misguided&#x2F;annoying. Like catch up defaulting to true. There&#x27;s this weird notion of tasks (dags in airflow speak) running on a cron pattern and requiring a start date in the past. Using a dynamic date is not recommended (i.e. now would be a sane default). So typically you just pick whatever fixed time in the past. When you turn a dag on it tries to &#x27;backfill&#x27; from that date unless you set catchup to false. I don&#x27;t know in what universe that&#x27;s a sane default. Sure, I want to run this task 1000 times just because I unpaused it (everything is paused by default). There is no way to unschedule that. Did I mention the default parallism is 32. That in combination with the docker operator is a great way to instantly run out of memory (yep that happened to us).<p>4) The UI lacks ways to group tasks like by tag or folders, etc. This gets annoying quickly.<p>5) Dag configs as code in a weakly typed language without a good test harness leads to obvious problems. We&#x27;ve sort of gobbled together our own tests to somewhat mitigate repeated deploy screw ups.<p>6) implementing a worker architecture in a language that is still burdened with the global interpreter lock and that has no good support for either threading or light weight threads (aka co-routines) or doing things asynchronously, leads to a lot of complexity. The celery worker is a PITA to debug.<p>7) IMHO the python operator is a bad idea because it gives data scientists the wrong idea about, oh just install this library on every airflow host please so I can run my thingy. We use the Docker operator a lot and are switching to the ECS operator as soon as we can figure out how to run airflow in ECS (we currently have a snow flaky AMI running on ec2).<p>8) the logging UI is terrible compared to what I would normally use for logging. Looking at logs of task runs is kind of the core business the UI has to do.<p>9) Airflow has a DB where it keeps track of state. Any change to dags basically means this state gets stale pretty quickly. There&#x27;s no sane way to get rid of this stale data other than a lot of command-line fiddling or just running some sql scripts directly against this db. I&#x27;ve manually deleted hundreds of jobs in the last month. Also there&#x27;s no notion of having a sane default for number of execution runs to preserve. Likewise the there is built in way to clean up logs. Again, Jenkins&#x2F;Hudson had that always. I have jobs that run every 10 minutes and absolutely no need to keep months of history on that.<p>There are more things I could list. Also, there are quite a few competing products; this is a very crowded space. I&#x27;ve given serious thought to using Spring Batch or even just firing up a Jenkins. Frankly the only reason we chose airflow is that it&#x27;s easier for data scientists who are mostly only comfortable with python. So far, I&#x27;ve been disappointed with how complex and flaky this setup is.<p>If you go down the path of using it, think hard about which operators you are going to use and why. IMHO dockerizing tasks means that most of what Airflow does is just ensuring your dockerized tasks run. Limiting what it does is a good thing. Just because you can doesn&#x27;t mean you should in airflow. IMHO most of the operators naturally lead to your airflow installs being snow flakes.<p>Not dockerizing means you are mixing code and orchestration. Just like installing dependencies on CI servers is not a great idea is also the reason why doing the same on an airflow system is a bad idea."],"time":["2020-05-29 16:51:17"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Vaslo"],"id":[23350322],"kids":{},"parent":[23349507],"text":["Has anyone who has used this also used SSIS?

They think that their parent’s lives were better while still under the rule of the British, but I don’t think so.<p>If anything, the British created a very exploitative situation in Hong Kong.  It was raw and predatory capitalism, and the rich exploited the poor.  And who were the richest there?

Airplane control software should not be allowed to have bugs. CPUs should not be allowed to have bugs. And OS&#x27;s should not be allowed to crash (looking at you Microsoft).<p>When one of these things happens, in my opinion the correct response is _not_ to just release fixes and workarounds and then say &quot;we&#x27;ll try really hard to not let it happen again.&quot; You do that, sure. But the first time you see airplane software malfunction, that means you need to change the way the software is written and released so that the whole class of issues will not ever happen again. You don&#x27;t stop at a public apology, you don&#x27;t fire the person that unintentionally wrote the bug. If you have to hire mathematicians to formally prove the critical paths of the software, you do that. If it costs 10x more to release bug-free software, oh well, you do that.<p>All of these corporate people thinking they can save money by spending less on quality are extremely naive.

The one here is not quite clear: it <i>seems<\/i> like it&#x27;s &quot;programming on the bare metal&quot;, but it does too many things for a result that isn&#x27;t all that surprising. Ok, you ditch Rust&#x27;s standard library, and core features of the language…but then you copy paste it back anyways, and after that you link against libc and call printf. The point is to show that you can do better with all your work, not the same.<p>* At the very end: you are an expert Rust developer, better than your interviewer. You know you&#x27;re not going to get an offer, but you didn&#x27;t want one from them anyways. You&#x27;re certainly not desperate to impress them.<p>Now that I&#x27;ve read the whole thing, a couple of technical comments:<p>* You can use -lc on macOS, libSystem will handle it for you.<p>* The existence of a &quot;frame pointer&quot; is a myth spread by bad programmers. There&#x27;s no point in touching that register and certainly no need to waste two bytes stashing it on the stack, for goodness sake!"],"time":["2020-05-29 20:37:43"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["umaar"],"id":[23353020],"kids":{},"parent":[23351145],"text":["I like this style of writing, feels like storytelling, rather than something purely instructional.

When its CEO Rony Abovitz took the stage at the beginning of the conference’s opening keynote, he vaguely framed the company’s technology as a remedy to political and other divisions plaguing today’s world, postulating: “Our new medium of spatial computing is fresh. It doesn’t carry the baggage and negative headlines that are dominating the news today.”<p>...<p>&gt;“The conversation that we are starting here goes on for decades,” proclaimed Abovitz. He went on to talk about Magic Leap’s idea to build city-wide AR information layers — an interesting idea, but not anything we should expect to materialize any time soon, as he freely admitted, while inexplicably bringing up the spectre of fascism:<p>&gt;“There is gonna be other companies proposing alternate x-verses. There will be all these competing universes and systems, like there is competing governments. There is monarchy, there is democracy, there is fascism, and there is progressive, liberal thought. And these holistic systems will be how governance might happen. How many people live their life. And this is not tomorrow, this might be a few years from now. But you set the stage for that right now.”<p>&gt;Abovitz seemed to sense that there was still some work to be done before Magic Leap could defeat fascism in the Magicverse — and he promptly proposed to host a Burning Man-style gathering to get it done:<p>&gt;“In order to continue this conversation, we probably kind of need a Burning Man in the desert. Like a kind of Magicverse event where we hang out for a few days, do a vision quest, build weird things. So more on that later, can’t commit to it 100%, but we think it’d be cool.”<p>&gt;There were some other odd moments that morning. A third-party developer read a poem to the audience. Science fiction author and Magic Leap chief futurist Neal Stephenson talked close to 10 minutes about virtual goats.

There are various possible endgames; in some of them you go to prison but in quite a lot of them you just stay rich and become an elder statesman admired for your business acumen.&quot;<p>The later part about the Chinese coffee company fraud also getting caught by motivated short sellers was also great:<p>&gt; &quot;The thing about inflating your revenue by pretending that you sold more coffee than you did is that people can go to your stores and watch you sell coffee. It is a reasonable bet that they won’t do that, because it’s incredibly boring. “Who is going to send 1,500 people to our stores to watch us sell coffee all day, count how much we sell and compare it to our financial statements,” Luckin could reasonably have thought. 1  But the answer was “short sellers”! They actually hired people to sit around watching the coffee get made, so they caught the fraud.&quot;<p>Matt Levine is a good writer (often funny too) - I&#x27;m impressed he can continually write up these high quality newsletters almost every day.<p>Between this, Stratechery, and Preet&#x27;s podcast I find it <i>really<\/i> hard to actually read all of this.<p>How do other people do this?<p>It&#x27;s hard to really have the time for even just one newsletter or podcast (at least with the podcasts you used to be able to listen in the car, back when we still drove places)."],"time":["2020-05-29 20:10:48"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["empira"],"id":[23352770],"kids":[23353005,23352942],"parent":[23351942],"text":["My previously employer offers just that : you could spend money to &#x27;buy&#x27; up to 10 (more) days of holidays per year (for context, you start with 20 mandatory days, plus 10 to 15 depending on your seniority and your age).
