You just provide the name of the project, push to git and GitLab CI will pick it up and do the stuff by the template. Even junior developers in our team are doing that from day one. \n Isn&#x27;t that a future we dream about? If you have too much load it will autoscale pod, if node is overloaded it will autoscale node pool, if you have a memory leak it will restart the app so you can sleep at night. I can provide a million examples that make our 100+ microservices management so much simpler. No Linux kungfu, 0 bash scrips, no SSH,  and interaction with OS, not a single devops role for 15+ developers team.<p>Our management of cluster is just a simple  &quot;add more CPU or memory to this nodepool&quot;, sometimes change a nodepool name for deployment for certain service. All done simple cloud management UI.\nFor those who call microservices fancy stuff. No, we are a startup with fast delivery, deploy cycle. We have tons of subproject , integrations, and our main languages are nodejs, golang and python. Some of these are not good at multi-thread so no way to run it as a monolith. The other one is used only when it&#x27;s needed for high performance. \nSo All together Microservices + Kubernetes + Helm + good CI + proper pubsub gives our backend extremely simple fast cycle of development, delivery, and what&#x27;s important flexibility in terms of language&#x2F;framework&#x2F;version.<p>What is also good is the installation of services. With helm I can install high availability redis setup for free in 5 minutes. The same level of setup will cost you several thousand dollars for devops work and further maintenance and update.

I can understand you can build something is Scala and Java slowly but with high quality as a monolith. You don&#x27;t need k8s for 3 services. I can understand some old DevOps don&#x27;t want to learn new things and they complain about a tool that reduces the need of these guys.

All of that could be put in a JSON file, which is far less complex.<p>YAML should not even be needed for Kubernetes. Configuration should be representable in a purely declarative way, instead of making the YAML mess, with all kinds of references and stuff. Perhaps the configuration specification needs to be re-worked. Many projects using YAML feel to me like a configuration trash can, where you just add more and more stuff, which you haven&#x27;t thought about.<p>I once tried moving an already containerized system to Kubernetes for testing, how that would work. It was a nightmare. It was a few years ago, maybe 3 years ago. Documentation was plenty but really sucked. I could not find _any_ documentation of what can be put into that YAML configuration file, what the structure really is. I read tens of pages of documentation, none of it helped me to find, what I needed. Then even to set everything up, to get the Kubernetes running at all also took way too much time and 3 people to figure out and was badly documented. It took multiple hours on at least 2 days. Necessary steps, I still remember, not being listed on one single page in any kind of overview, but somewhere a required step was hidden on another documentation page, that was not even mentioned in the list of steps to take.<p>Finally having set things up, I had a web interface in front of me, where I was supposed to be able to configure pods or something. Only, that I could not configure everything I had in my already containerized system, via that web interface. It seems that this web interface was only meant for the most basic use cases, where one does not need to provide containers with much configuration. My only remaining option was to upload a YAML file, which was undocumented, as far as I could see back then. That&#x27;s were I stopped. A horrible experience and I wish not to have it again.<p>There were also naming issues. There was something called &quot;Helm&quot;. To me that sounds like an Emacs package. But OK I guess we have these naming issues everywhere in software development. Still bugs me though, as it feels like Google pushes down its naming of things into many people&#x27;s minds and sooner or later, most people will associate Google things with names, which have previously meant different things.<p>There were 1 or 2 layers of abstraction in Kubernetes, which I found completely useless for my use-case and wished they were not there, but of course I had to deal with them, as the system is not flexible to allow me to only have layers I need. I just wanted to run my containers on multiple machines, balancing the load and automatically restarting on crashes, you know, all the nice things Erlang offers already for ages.<p>I feel like Kubernetes is the Erlang ecosystem for the poor or uneducated, who&#x27;ve never heard of other ways, with features poorly copied.<p>If I really needed to bring a system to multiple servers and scale and load balance, I&#x27;d rather look into something like Nomad. Seems much simpler and also offers load balancing over multiple machines and can run docker containers and normal applications as well, plus I was able to set it up in less than an hour or so, having to servers in the system."],"time":["2020-05-30 00:17:07"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["courtf"],"id":[23357391],"kids":[23357705,23357526,23358470,23358134,23357965,23358384,23357624,23357472,23357711,23358274,23357871,23357509],"parent":[23354418],"text":["I honestly couldn&#x27;t tell you.<p>What I can tell you, is that the unbelievable bloat in the complexity of our systems is going to bite us in the ass.

Ansible is a very useful abstraction&#x2F;force multiplier for doing ops. If a dedicated conference is a measure of community&#x2F;enthusiasm reaching a fever pitch, it took 4 years for Ansible to reach critical mass. Kubernetes had it&#x27;s first Kubecon in 2015[1] ONE year after it&#x27;s initial release in 2014[2]. Did it reach critical mass 4x quicker than ansible? Maybe, but I think the simpler explanation is that the people who want Kubernetes to succeed know that creating buzz and the <i>appearance<\/i> of widespread adoption and community is more important than it actually being there, as it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Once you have enough onlookers, people motivated to work on open source (i.e. give away labor, time and energy for free) will come improve your project with you, serve as an initial user base, your biggest promoters, all the while strengthening your ecosystem.<p>Another interesting side to this is how thoroughly Kubernetes <i>seems<\/i> to be crushing it&#x27;s competition -- DC&#x2F;OS (Mesos), Nomad and other competition are not fighting a functionality war, they&#x27;re fighting a marketing war. DC&#x2F;OS and Nomad are not obviously worse in function, but certainly don&#x27;t compare when you consider ecosystem size (perceived, if not actual) and brand. It&#x27;s a winner-take-most scenario and tech companies are particularly good at seizing this kind of opportunity. Of course, if you compare the resources of the entities backing these projects, it&#x27;s clear who was going to win the marketing war.<p>In a world of free tiers as a good way to get people locked in, developer evangelists who build essentially propaganda projects (no matter how cool they are), and shrinking attention spans, Kubernetes is a good tool which has marketed itself to greatness. In it&#x27;s wake there are efforts like the CNCF which I struggle to characterize because it&#x27;s hard to differentiate their efforts to standardize from an effort to bureaucratize. I&#x27;m almost certainly blinded by my own cynicism but most of this just doesn&#x27;t feel organic. Big, useful open source software gets world-renowned after years&#x2F;decades of being convenient&#x2F;useful&#x2F;correct&#x2F;etc but Kubernetes (and other projects given the CNCF gold star) seem to be trying to skip this process or at least bootstrap a reputation out of the gate.<p>DevOps traditionally moved much slower -- I can remember what seemed like an age of &quot;salt vs ansible vs chef&quot;, with all three technologies having had lots of times to prove themselves useful. Even the switch to containers instead of VM&#x2F;user based process isolation took more time than Kubernetes has taken to dominate the zeitgeist.<p>[0]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ansible_(software)\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ansible_(software)<\/a><p>[1]: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.voxuspr.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;03&#x2F;what-is-kubecon-its-past-present-and-future\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.voxuspr.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;03&#x2F;what-is-kubecon-its-past-pres...<\/a><p>[2]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Kubernetes\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Kubernetes<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-30 07:36:10"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["foobar_"],"id":[23357349],"kids":{},"parent":[23354418],"text":["The arguments used to consistently market software<p>1.

Instead of using 53 bits to represent 52 bits, use 60 bits, and now you can perform 256 sequential additions with no carrying between words before the carry part saturates and needs to be handled.<p>Somewhat surprisingly, it&#x27;s even possible to use this construction in the context of a quantum computation [2][3]. The reason it&#x27;s surprising is because tacking on additional registers like this can act as an information leakage mechanism (which is an error in a quantum computation). For analogy, you can imagine that if you computed a public key using this trick that you would not be comfortable handing an attacker the registers storing your public key before you removed the carry padding that made the computation faster. But it turns out that if you just initialize the carry padding randomly, subtracting out of the next word at the start to ensure everything sums to the correct result at the end, then you can show that the information leakage and chance-of-bad-overflow is exponentially suppressed in the length of the carry padding. Currently the most efficient known way to implement Shor&#x27;s algorithm uses this technique [4].<p>1: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Carry-save_adder\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Carry-save_adder<\/a><p>2: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;1905.08488\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;1905.08488<\/a><p>3: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;upTipX9yXNg?t=777\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;upTipX9yXNg?t=777<\/a><p>4: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;1905.09749\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;1905.09749<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-29 21:51:03"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["tspiteri"],"id":[23351989],"kids":[23354342,23352839],"parent":[23351007],"text":["&gt; Aside: Why 13 bits instead of 12?

While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language task from only a few examples or from simple instructions – something which current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3 achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time, we also identify some datasets where GPT-3&#x27;s few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate samples of news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from articles written by humans. We discuss broader societal impacts of this finding and of GPT-3 in general."],"time":["2020-05-29 03:47:58"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["dsign"],"id":[23346798],"kids":{},"parent":[23345379],"text":["With things like this, we will need to change how the media work, and how we read news.

Upwork is a bit of a grind. User&#x27;s can search for a skill they&#x27;d like to freelance in ( Cisco Networking, Python programming, Painting Dogs, whatever) and apply for job&#x27;s via proposals. The crappy thing about Upwork is that once a job is posted, the heat is on to apply. The longer you let the job sit, the more likely that other freelancers will apply for it and get the work. Being early was an extreme advantage, even if you are the best.<p>After googling around a bit, I found that Upwork had no way for user&#x27;s to get alerts  on new jobs, even though many user&#x27;s requested it. &quot;Hmmm, I thought, a market need&quot;. There were, though, countless forum posts and low-quality YouTube videos explaining how to set up alerts via IFTTT and Upwork&#x27;s RSS feeds feature. &quot;<p>As a long time Upwork freelancer (12 years now) - short answer would be that you&#x27;re not cut for freelancer&#x27;s market. Long answer is harder to stomach, so skip next paragraph:<p>1 - Being early is disadvantage actually. Being early means your bid gets dumped in job poster&#x27;s email along with the others. You want to be 1st (hard to be and you&#x27;ll never have the guarantee even with a fast notification) or let it sit for 24 hours.<p>2 - Rant about not having notifications then answering yourself about using RSS. If RSS is hard for you to make it work then I&#x27;ll have to wonder about the rest of your skills as programmer. Personally I didn&#x27;t like any RSS feed apps out there so I wrote my own, customized to my needs.

To be honest, I don&#x27;t like it for a lot of reasons:<p>1) it&#x27;s not cloud native in the sense that running this on e.g. AWS is an easy and well trodden path. Cloud is left as an exercise to the reader of the documentation and at best vaguely hinted at as a possibility. This is weird because that kind of is the whole point of this product. Sure, it has lots of things that are highly useful in the cloud (like an ECS operator or EMR operator); but the documentation is aimed at python hackers running this on their laptop; all the defaults are aimed at this as well. This is a problem because essentially all of that is wrong for a proper cloud native type environment. We&#x27;ve looked at quite a few third party repos for terraform, kubernetes, cloudformation, etc that try to fix this. Ultimately we ended up spending non trivial amounts of time on devops. Basically, this involved lots of problem solving for things that a combination of wrong, poorly documented, or misguided by default. Also, we&#x27;re not done by a long shot.<p>2) The UX&#x2F;UI is terrible and I don&#x27;t use this word lightly. Think hudson&#x2F;jenkins, 15 years ago (and technically that&#x27;s unfair to good old Hudson because it never was this bad). It&#x27;s a fair comparison because Jenkins kind of is a drop in replacement or at least a significant overlap in feature set. And it arguably has a better ecosystem for things like plugins. Absolutely everything in Airflow requires multiple clicks. Also you&#x27;ll be doing CMD+R a lot as there is no concept of autorefresh. Lots of fiddly icons. And then there&#x27;s this obsession with graphs and this being the most important thing ever. There are two separate graph views, only one of which has useful ways of getting to the logs (which never requires less than 4-5 mouse clicks). And of course the other view is the default under most links so you have to learn to click the tiny graph icon to get to the good stuff.<p>3) A lot of the defaults are wrong&#x2F;misguided&#x2F;annoying. Like catch up defaulting to true. There&#x27;s this weird notion of tasks (dags in airflow speak) running on a cron pattern and requiring a start date in the past. Using a dynamic date is not recommended (i.e. now would be a sane default). So typically you just pick whatever fixed time in the past. When you turn a dag on it tries to &#x27;backfill&#x27; from that date unless you set catchup to false. I don&#x27;t know in what universe that&#x27;s a sane default. Sure, I want to run this task 1000 times just because I unpaused it (everything is paused by default). There is no way to unschedule that. Did I mention the default parallism is 32. That in combination with the docker operator is a great way to instantly run out of memory (yep that happened to us).<p>4) The UI lacks ways to group tasks like by tag or folders, etc. This gets annoying quickly.<p>5) Dag configs as code in a weakly typed language without a good test harness leads to obvious problems. We&#x27;ve sort of gobbled together our own tests to somewhat mitigate repeated deploy screw ups.<p>6) implementing a worker architecture in a language that is still burdened with the global interpreter lock and that has no good support for either threading or light weight threads (aka co-routines) or doing things asynchronously, leads to a lot of complexity. The celery worker is a PITA to debug.<p>7) IMHO the python operator is a bad idea because it gives data scientists the wrong idea about, oh just install this library on every airflow host please so I can run my thingy. We use the Docker operator a lot and are switching to the ECS operator as soon as we can figure out how to run airflow in ECS (we currently have a snow flaky AMI running on ec2).<p>8) the logging UI is terrible compared to what I would normally use for logging. Looking at logs of task runs is kind of the core business the UI has to do.<p>9) Airflow has a DB where it keeps track of state. Any change to dags basically means this state gets stale pretty quickly. There&#x27;s no sane way to get rid of this stale data other than a lot of command-line fiddling or just running some sql scripts directly against this db. I&#x27;ve manually deleted hundreds of jobs in the last month. Also there&#x27;s no notion of having a sane default for number of execution runs to preserve. Likewise the there is built in way to clean up logs. Again, Jenkins&#x2F;Hudson had that always. I have jobs that run every 10 minutes and absolutely no need to keep months of history on that.<p>There are more things I could list. Also, there are quite a few competing products; this is a very crowded space. I&#x27;ve given serious thought to using Spring Batch or even just firing up a Jenkins. Frankly the only reason we chose airflow is that it&#x27;s easier for data scientists who are mostly only comfortable with python. So far, I&#x27;ve been disappointed with how complex and flaky this setup is.<p>If you go down the path of using it, think hard about which operators you are going to use and why. IMHO dockerizing tasks means that most of what Airflow does is just ensuring your dockerized tasks run. Limiting what it does is a good thing. Just because you can doesn&#x27;t mean you should in airflow. IMHO most of the operators naturally lead to your airflow installs being snow flakes.<p>Not dockerizing means you are mixing code and orchestration. Just like installing dependencies on CI servers is not a great idea is also the reason why doing the same on an airflow system is a bad idea."],"time":["2020-05-29 16:51:17"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["Vaslo"],"id":[23350322],"kids":{},"parent":[23349507],"text":["Has anyone who has used this also used SSIS?

Swift is really interesting to me because it is very similar in practice to Kotlin, but with some very cool and powerful additional language features.

You enjoyed the Game, and the victory, no doubt, at the time: but you have no result that you can treasure up and get real good out of. And, all the while, you have been leaving unexplored a perfect mine of wealth.

One of the things that struck me is that people who investigate UFOs are their own worst enemies. Often, while watching documentaries, people will say &quot;I&#x27;ve never believed in UFOs until I saw one&quot;. For the longest time statements like that really confused me. How could you not believe that people sometimes see things that they can&#x27;t identify? Then I realized that to most people UFO means alien spacecraft. UFO people have pushed the &quot;I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s aliens, but it&#x27;s totally aliens&quot; narrative to the point that the entire field is tainted.<p>As the article mentions, it seems like the idea of aliens visiting the Earth has become almost some sort of religion.

I&#x27;m reminded of the Hessdalen lights, unidentified aerial lights that have been appearing over a valley in northern Norway for several decades. There&#x27;s a monitoring station there with all sorts of instruments, but there still isn&#x27;t a definitive explanation for the lights. &quot;These are alien spaceships&quot; is definitely a much more thrilling explanation than &quot;we have several possible explanations, mostly involving some sort of plasma in the atmosphere&quot;.<p>One of the documentaries I was watching was by the History channel and it was really bad. They didn&#x27;t even attempt to present prosaic explanations and took everything at face value. One episode even talked about native Americans being descended from aliens and being able to summon UFOs.

Navy patents filed by the US Navy on behalf of Dr. Salvatore Cezar Pais and document leaks added to effect more confusion.

He&#x27;s tightly lipped about what&#x27;s in them, but he&#x27;s an expert on the matter.  He and his team built and launched a solid state gallium ion drive into space and demonstrated their orbital correction capabilities.  Over the years he tested several prototypes of both the EmDrive and the Mach Effect thrusters and dismissed them in various iterations of his thrust measurement experiments, the latest published works describing the observed miniscule effects as thermal vibrations and interactions of the Earth&#x27;s magnetic fields with power lines in the test chamber.  But they were inconclusive.<p>This time around, Tajmar built a magnetic shielding chamber meant to exclude those effects.  One paper is for analysis of the conventionally microwave-described EmDrive, and other one is for its laser version.  Mark your calendar and the papers might put a nail in parts of this coffin.<p>The publication date is somewhat telling.  The papers were meant to be released in the Space Propulsion 2020 conference this month but due to Covid-19 they were delayed until March.  It&#x27;s a stretch that a significant scientific breakthrough would be delayed, but, on the other hand he is a German.<p>Tajmar himself wasn&#x27;t hopeful prior to the latest measurement experiment: &quot;This is such an extraordinary claim that you must, as Carl Sagan said, have extraordinary proofs.

UFOs which cannot be attributed to known natural phenomena or man-made technologies. Of course, I don&#x27;t think they are alien spacecrafts, and alternative explanations, such as unidentified natural phenomena are more likely. However, there are two problems regarding to UFOs. The first problem is, it&#x27;s not a single phenomenon, but a class of different phenomena, potentially hundreds of different things. The next problem is, their appearances are entirely unpredictable, you cannot just wait at a place and keep observing it with a rack of instrumentation. These two problems mean that UFO will continue to be an open question for many decades, if not forever, and most researches will not recognize them as an genuinely unknown physical phenomena.<p>Consider Ball Lightning [0]. It&#x27;s real, and there are 200 years of anecdotal reports from everywhere in the world. Yet, until recently, it was not recognized as a real phenomenon by many researchers in the scientific communities - for good reason, &quot;I never saw one in my life, and why should I believe these random stories on ball lightning, if there&#x27;s no irrefutable data recorded by a scientific instrument?&quot; But because of its unpredictable nature, it&#x27;s highly unlikely to carry a scientific observation to begin with. It was only scientifically observed in 2014, for a duration of only 1.6 seconds [1], by a coincidence. If arguing for the existence of ball lightning is that difficult, now imagine the case of UFO.<p>I believe a lot of data can be potentially gathered on UFO - acoustic, optical, radar, or X-ray measurements are all possibilities. However, because of the not-a-single-phenomenon and unpredictable nature of UFOs, such scientific investigations will never be funded. And even if there are funded, such projects will be a wild-goose chase on unpredictable UFOs, and such UFOs will disappear before you are ready to do some observations on them. It&#x27;s unlikely to find anything significant. And don&#x27;t even mention that UFO&#x27;s popular connotation of aliens alone is enough to discredit the potential scientific efforts of investigations.<p>On the other hand, hypothetically, imagine that UFOs could always appear at a specific geographical locations in a predictable manner, only then the members of academia will start treating it seriously and real researches will be funded.

The two are not at all necessarily related and the public discourse, especially in mass media, UFOlogy dogma and literature, only weakens arguments because of this forced connection based on tenuous leaps of logic.<p>By definition, any unidentified object in the sky is a UFO unless it&#x27;s clearly identified, as many here have already mentioned. Thus, for one thing, many UFOs can simply be this: things that may or may not be natural but which have some rational explanation and have not been clearly labeled as such.<p>However, and more importantly I think, is the possibility that even a genuinely inexplicable UFO event (such as the 1978 nuclear storage events linked to in another comment here [1], the 2004 Nimitz UFO incidents and the 2014 and 2015 events among others) may not be the classical aliens in the sky concept that gets pushed despite little substance, though it might indeed be a case of unknown objects moving around human installations with a certain frequency. The latter is a highly documented, definitively observed phenomena, the former is very shaky assumption and absolutely nothing more. Evidence of unknown objects moving in seemingly incredible ways abounds. There is no evidence at all of those objects being ships from another world in the galaxy or Universe.<p>What this boils down to is that UFOs as a genuinely, currently inexplicable phenomena could very well be completely real. They might even be corporeal expressions of an intelligent nature. This however doesn&#x27;t have to mean that they came from space or from aliens in any classical sense. They could have come from a completely unknown source that doesn&#x27;t get nearly as much attention as the UFOs = aliens supposition. Certain authors have covered this with their own speculations and arguments, such as Jacques Vallee, Micheal Persinger, and even others with more sensationalist arguments like John Keel. None of them are necessarily less likely to be wrong than those who argue that we&#x27;re dealing with aliens, and at least some of these arguments seem more plausible than the dogmatic skeptic stance of completely disregarding all sightings as anything except humans being confused by normal, known phenomena.<p>An important sub-point to the previous paragraph is that the government might seem to be playing stupid not because of some giant coverup of secret knowledge or much less clandestine contact with extraterrestrials, but the (to me) much more likely possibility of a general attempt to cover up that they also have no clue what&#x27;s going on whenever they come across cases that none of their resources let them explain. It&#x27;s possible that (as is common with any kind of organizational thinking) they detest looking stupid and prefer looking ambiguous to admitting ignorance of something completely outside their ability to control or monitor clearly.<p>1. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thedrive.com&#x2F;the-war-zone&#x2F;31798&#x2F;the-secretive-inventor-of-the-navys-bizarre-ufo-patents-finally-talks\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thedrive.com&#x2F;the-war-zone&#x2F;31798&#x2F;the-secretive-in...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-09-13 07:38:04"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["mgraczyk"],"id":[24455453],"kids":[24455489],"parent":[24453825],"text":["Not sure what is intended, but it seems to have some bugs?<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;assets.opentoken.com&#x2F;sha256&#x2F;N1ShZ7kcVmH_-auZEGaGOS_baJxgQTG2\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;assets.opentoken.com&#x2F;sha256&#x2F;N1ShZ7kcVmH_-auZEGaGOS_b...<\/a><p>Ah nevermind, it&#x27;s matching the curve against template fields so it makes sense that it would show the best match even when the match is poor."],"time":["2020-09-12 22:40:25"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["rg2004"],"id":[24454636],"kids":{},"parent":[24453825],"text":["I created a method similar to this one for curve extrapolation based on sample curves.

I have a somewhat unusual background in that I came to DevOps from a background in traditional systems administration (e.g. Windows MSP, network engineering, Linux sysadmin), and a later career background in security. As a result I tend towards old-school. For flavor, I once held a title in &quot;Compilation Engineering,&quot; not meaning engineering the compilers, but managing the clusters that ran them. My concerns tend to be radically different from those with a software engineering background, even within a &quot;DevOps team&quot;. I have occasionally said that there are many &quot;DEVops,&quot; a few &quot;devOPS,&quot; and almost nothing in between.<p>I think there&#x27;s some good content in this article but also a certain amount of, I&#x27;m not sure what to call it. Inexperience?<p>I can agree that in an ideal world having people with the title of DevOps Engineer or especially a DevOps team is an antipattern. However, in most organizations I have worked in there has been a clear need to hire people specifically for DevOps and a good component of the work has been, at least initially, limited to those individuals. The basic reason is that most software engineers, even very experienced ones, are generally quite weak in the areas of operations, network engineering, conventional system administration, and compliance. I don&#x27;t necessarily blame them as these are areas that are addressed poorly or not at all in most academic programs, and are not generally viewed as skills which are behooving of a software engineer. The result is that individuals need to be hired specifically for DevOps roles in order to get that skillset.<p>Further, except in perhaps some of the most fortunate startups, DevOps is virtually always transformational---that is, it is being put in place to either replace a previous process (e.g. development in one division and operations in another) or to create process for the first time (e.g. a startup which has had testing and deployments done manually by developers). This is another factor that makes designed DevOps contributors valuable, because the bottom line is that DevOps needs to be forced on the organization to some extent. It can often take an outsider to drive significant change in business processes.<p>Finally, as much as DevOps is bandied about, I am not convinced that most <i>developers<\/i> are actually interested in working in an &quot;ideal&quot; DevOps environment. I have spent most of my career as an IT person supporting developers, whether that was called DevOps or just being the person in IT the developers emailed. In most of these roles I have done a lot of things that the developers just weren&#x27;t willing to, and even as a &quot;DevOps Engineer&quot; I continue to view &quot;keeping out of the developer&#x27;s way&quot; as a primary goal. This means, for example, that I usually handle most of the tool development around local (developer workstation) and automated build and test because the developers just don&#x27;t want to---ironically, in the eyes of many developers, I think DevOps means the developers being as uninvolved in operations as possible.<p>They&#x27;re turning to DevOps because they want to get rid of the workload associated with herding a traditional IT organization, not because they want to do it all themselves! I don&#x27;t really blame them either as, as I said, not many developers really have the skillset to excel with this kind of thing, nor (and this is more opinion) the inclination to obtain that skillset. There just aren&#x27;t that many people out there who care about getting the Kubernetes cluster to self-heal right or finding the weird performance&#x2F;stability problem in the software-defined network, which is why DevOps tends to be split-brained between &quot;automating operations&quot; and &quot;paying someone else so we don&#x27;t have to think about it,&quot; which is the general goal to which most cloud providers aspire.<p>Ultimately, the goal of all DevOps organizations ought to be to eliminate themselves by getting things to be so painless and automated that developers will do it all themselves. But basically no organization signs up for DevOps with the idea that they are adding workload to the developers, and so at least initially a dedicated DevOps capacity needs to exist from a practical perspective. The issues of skillset and desired work characteristics mean that that capacity tends to stick around. As much as DevOps is bandied about as two great tastes that taste great together, the reality may very well be that all DevOps really means is getting the IT resources and the development resources to talk to each other more often and do enough cross-training to be able to understand the other&#x27;s problems, and honestly I think that&#x27;s fine.<p>But then I say that as someone who intentionally does not describe myself as a software engineer because I frankly don&#x27;t enjoy writing software that much... and yet part of my job always ends up being troubleshooting the product, adding tracing and monitoring integrations, etc. I can&#x27;t complain too much because I do need the familiarity with the code base to be able to address developer requests well. Similarly, the developers need the familiarity with my work to be able to understand how it impacts them and how to engineer for effective deployment and management, but I wouldn&#x27;t wish my configuration management and network diagrams on them.<p>Or I could sum up the entire thing more shortly: DevOps as an ideal is founded on the concept that there exists a set of people who want to be evenly responsible for both the development <i>and<\/i> the operations. I have not so far met more than one or two of these people, certainly not enough to staff a company with. Barring such miraculous hiring, viewing DevOps as getting your development people and operations people to work effectively together is just fine."],"time":["2020-09-12 07:27:38"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["leokennis"],"id":[24451097],"kids":[24452747,24452059],"parent":[24441392],"text":["Wasn’t the idea of DevOps to put Dev and Ops engineers (two distinct roles) in one team?<p>So instead of the Dev team working on code and testing it, and then throwing it over a silo wal to the Ops team to run it in production, now they collaborated from the start to in the end ship good quality code?<p>When was it decided this meant one person had to know two jobs?"],"time":["2020-09-12 11:20:37"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["Aperocky"],"id":[24448915],"kids":{},"parent":[24441392],"text":["I work in a large cloud provider.<p>&gt; Are they hiring for a single role or a whole team?<p>YES.<p>That&#x27;s right, while the teams might have different responsibilities, but some remain constant. like provisioning infrastructure, going oncall and solving tickets, writing your actual software and think about and design the next iteration.<p>The expectation for team members is that one should be able to do all that, not at once obviously, but when needed will rise to the task."],"time":["2020-09-12 02:56:37"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["busrf"],"id":[24448889],"kids":{},"parent":[24441392],"text":["This is a great article.
