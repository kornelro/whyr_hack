Has something been proposed recently?<p>&gt; Now, many compilers have done some work with this using what are known as intrinsics. However, these do not allow us to fully exploit what we can in assembly. Most of the intrinsic instructions follow the C calling conventions, so they are required to load from RAM, do something with it, then store back into RAM.<p>&gt; Since we store the intermediate values, we’re exercising the memory controller for every intrinsic. For our assembly, we load at the beginning and store at the very end. Nothing is in between.<p>I don&#x27;t understand this claim. It seems demonstrably false to me.

We were eventually able to hack around it without too much pain.\nAnother service used XML and we had a lot of trouble finding XML libraries.\nThere were some but nothing remotely as nice as Nokogiri.\nWhile all of this was happening, adding to our frustrations, a new version of Phoenix was released with a lot of changes. The only documentation for how to migrate an existing app was a typo laden GitHub Gist by the author of Phoenix.\nThe final straw was when we got a call from the client about another service we had to integrate.\nThis one used JSON but the <i>order of the keys<\/i> was important\n(please for the love of whatever god you believe in never do this).\nWhen we had to decide whether to write a custom JSON parser or move to Ruby, we rewrote the thing in Rails.<p>The second project was already a few thousand lines of code when we started working on it.\nIt was a dumpster fire of a project but the devs who built it praised Elixir to the skies\nand said it was way better than their old Rails version.

Business logic adds coupling to related code in other systems that often all need to change together, or get changed in a hurry. Either way, the engineer trying to do the change probably won’t know Elixir. Likely they were appointed to make the change by a PM who doesn’t know or care much about which systems were built in which languages and who knows those languages. And that engineer won’t know Elixir, and they’ll complain about being unable to work on your Elixir system, and it will give Elixir a bad reputation at your company in the eyes of managers and PMs. It won’t matter much if your system has high uptime or low tail latency or whatever.<p>The solution to this is to only use Elixir for building infrastructure. Nobody cares much what language PostgreSQL or RabbitMQ or Kafka are written in. You don’t modify the source code for those things typically, you just use them through some kind of API. Similarly if your company needs a notification delivery system, you can build that in Elixir. You just have to do it in such a way that nobody will ever be blocked trying to launch a new kind of notification because they need to learn Elixir first.

Elixir is still a pretty leaky abstraction over Erlang. In my experience it&#x27;s not enough to learn just Elixir, I regularly had to dive into Erlang library source code to debug or answer questions. This somewhat negates the benefit of a small, stripped down syntax when you often have to learn another one in conjunction.<p>2. Maturity of ecosystem. This should improve over time but I&#x27;ve had challenges finding high quality libraries, especially for things like database connection drivers or making network requests. It&#x27;s often hard to tell how well-supported or complete a library is and regressions were a regular occurrence.<p>3. Documentation. In practice I rarely found official documentation complete or even helpful (outside of big projects like Phoenix &#x2F; Ecto). Even core Erlang libraries had surprising chunks missing. It&#x27;s been awhile but I remember it being very hard to figure out what options were supported in Erlang&#x27;s TLS wrapper. I ended up stitching together pieces from the OpenSSL documentation, Erlang source code, and lots of trial and error.<p>4. OTP overlap with other scheduling systems. This isn&#x27;t a design flaw as much as a potential footgun depending on how you deploy Elixir code, but there is a lot of overlap between the cluster management support in Erlang&#x2F;OTP and, for example, container orchestration in Kubernetes. Both support scheduling some concept of tasks, configuring redundant copies of tasks, detecting problems, and restarting tasks according to policy. Deploying an OTP application on top of Kubernetes (on top of Linux) results in 3 layers of OS-like task scheduling to learn, teach, maintain, and debug through, all with distinct tooling, terminology, and limitations.<p>All in all, I found Erlang&#x2F;OTP to be a pretty interesting and compelling platform, especially for certain special purpose applications.

I am new to the language (I&#x27;ve been using it for &quot;years&quot; but only very part time (not part of my day job)).  While the functional approach does lead to much more elegant code, it can also be super esoteric to me as I&#x27;m new to and somewhat uncomfortable with the idea of recursion for everything.  There are pre-written macros to help of course, but it&#x27;s just training wheels.  This will improve with time and experience.  I also don&#x27;t fully grok how to write my own macros.  What I really need to do is spend a couple of days deep diving until I get it.<p>2.  Phoenix is changing quickly (tho slowing down).  I wrote some stuff if Phoenix 1.2, 1.3, and the upgrade path is a bit involved (no more so than a rails upgrade was tho).  I suspect it&#x27;s stabilizing, but when I first created one project it used brunch for assets, now it uses webpack (which is a good choice, but as a non-frontend person I&#x27;m not well equipped to make the change myself to upgrade my project).  1.3 (IIRC) also dropped models, so that required some refactor to work as a 1.3 project.<p>3.  Deployment changes quite a bit.  The old rules for Ruby go out the window.  You can still treat your Phoenix app like a rails app if you want, but it&#x27;s like buying a Ferrari to drive around the neighborhood at 25 mph.  This takes some learning, and while much of the old rules about scalability, etc are still applicable, they do change a bit and it requires making new mistakes and learning from them.<p>4.

My tolerance for side-effects is down to nearly zero, and I get irritated when there&#x27;s a dozen lines to do something that in Elixir is a couple of pipes.<p>That said, overall I much prefer Phoenix&#x2F;Elixir.

Hiring. Generally speaking, finding experienced Elixir engineers is not cheap nor easy. Also, chances of finding someone willing to work in an office is even more slim (very remote heavy talent pool)...<p>2. Deployment&#x2F;monitoring. Shipping your first Elixir application to production will likely be one giant act of frustration if you&#x27;re used to Ruby or other scripting languages. Compile time vs runtime settings and environment variables are a HUGE gotcha. Also, as fate would have it, BEAM is more like an operating system than a simple runtime and thinking you can toss it into container and be off to the races is a recipe for disaster. Hope you didn&#x27;t want to use distributed Erlang... (though this has gotten better recently, tbh). A lot of common monitoring tools and methodologies have to be thrown out the window because of how BEAM works internally (there are great ones to accomplish most anything, but its just more to learn).<p>3. Distributed systems, make for distributed problems. Yes, Erlang&#x2F;Elixir and BEAM give you some fucking amazing tools to build distributed systems... that doesn&#x27;t make building distributed systems themselves &quot;easy&quot; or &quot;quick.&quot;<p>4. Performance. Erlang&#x2F;Elixir will probably take a hot-fast shit on most scripting languages when it comes to network requests; however, if you need to do any long-running number crunching or complex string manipulation, you&#x27;d be better off almost anywhere else. This could also be categorized as &quot;use the right tool for the job, dummy.&quot;<p>5. Learning curve is real and vastly underestimated. You aren&#x27;t just learning a language, you&#x27;re sort of embarking on a quest to learn a new paradigm. Erlang&#x2F;Elixir, BEAM, and OTP (I&#x27;m going to refer to them as the &quot;Triforce&quot;) were designed together to solve a specific set of problems. The Triforce has been in-use, 24&#x2F;7, 365 days a year, for 30 years, in real, critical, production systems. If you ever wanted to learn the &quot;Actor&quot; pattern, BEAM is the most <i>metal<\/i> implementation I know of... Also, really sit down and make sure you understand it&#x27;s all &quot;non-blocking&quot; thanks to the scheduler being able to pre-empt processes.<p>----<p>With regards to 3rd party libraries, I find in Elixir and Erlang, I need and use way less of them... BEAM and OTP give you soooooooo much it&#x27;s kind of absurd how little you end up missing or wanting.<p>----<p>Lastly, while a lot of the success stories here are great to read, a lot of them have bad code, or things that are just silly to the trained eye. And that&#x27;s totally okay, the authors are learning, we all have do it, but I&#x27;d probably not recommend the code as study material. In general, try and find examples from people who have seem to have been using it for a few years.<p>----<p>Addendum (via edit):<p>FWIW, I&#x27;ve been writing Elixir for about six years now (just checked some commits), and have been employed full-time writing Elixir for five of those. I wrote Ruby before that, and have never looked back...

Things like LV based file uploads as being part of the library was in the &quot;near future&quot; or &quot;on the horizon&quot; a year ago, etc..<p>I only spent a weekend using it for a project to play with about 6 weeks ago and ended up uncovering some bugs and even some feature requests that quickly ended up making its way into the master branch of LV after reporting them. But these are for things that seemed very basic to me in the sense that if the folks who were developing it were using it in larger production apps, there&#x27;s no way those things wouldn&#x27;t have made it into the library sooner.<p>In other words, I don&#x27;t feel comfortable or confident at all to use it in production because I&#x27;m afraid if I spend some real time working with it, I&#x27;m going to end up being patient zero for so many bugs and edge cases. I want to focus on building my apps and trust the libraries I use, not be a pioneer (software is already difficult enough without bugs!).<p>On the flip side, Rails is a champion here and IMO it&#x27;s very much why it&#x27;s so popular and will remain popular 5 or even 10 years from now. It&#x27;s because most of the things in Rails come from tech focused businesses using it to drive their services and the core team also use it to drive their business. Everything feels like it&#x27;s really battle hardened, production ready when features are talked about and was carefully designed based on months of real world usage.<p>With Elixir, Phoenix and LV that feeling isn&#x27;t there -- at least not to me. It sort of kind of feels like the libraries are being built from a theoretical point of view. I mean, I know the creators of those libraries do consulting work, but it&#x27;s super behind closed doors. There&#x27;s never any talk about what drives the development of practical features and it&#x27;s kind of a bummer to get glimpses of things on the horizon, but then years later they aren&#x27;t ready for production.<p>That&#x27;s the thing that worries me about the future of the ecosystem. I also think it&#x27;s partly why it hasn&#x27;t exploded in popularity. It&#x27;s a nice ecosystem for sure, but it&#x27;s missing critical components for it to be adopted by the masses.<p>That and I think generally speaking the language is very hard to pick up. I know I struggle hard with Elixir with ~20 years of general dev experience across half a dozen non-functional languages before touching Elixir. I still feel like I have trouble reading Elixir code I&#x27;ve written 2 months ago when it uses some &quot;real&quot; functional bits that I had to ask for help on.<p>I often feel like I hit 100% dead ends and have to ask another human for help. I don&#x27;t think I would be using the language if it wasn&#x27;t for the IRC &#x2F; Slack channels. There&#x27;s some folks going above and beyond to help people out there, including Jose himself (the creator of Elixir).<p>With Python and Ruby I rarely encounter situations where I had to ask for help like this. Google always had the answer for everything I couldn&#x27;t figure out based on tinkering and reading the docs.<p>It&#x27;s not just due to less blog posts existing for Elixir &#x2F; Phoenix too. It&#x27;s the language overall. I want to love it, but for whatever reason my brain won&#x27;t accept it naturally. I get hung up so frequently. I know this is just my brain being an idiot, but I do wonder if anyone else feels the same.<p>My gut tells me yes because otherwise the language would already be one of the most popular choices for building web apps.

A large one that has a switch statement to execute the correct function, and two other ones for some quite long-running processes.<p>- The big lambda was executed too many times. Moving it to an actual server would cost me way less. So I did.

At first, this was indeed fast to develop and simple.<p>The company grew and the product saw heavier use. The original monolithic server became slow and problematic. Hosting cost became very high. Separate teams ran into conflicts while working on the server.<p>So we have incrementally switched to an FaaS-centric architecture, similar to the one in the article. The new design makes it easier to get excellent stability, performance, cost and observability. Now that the development team is a little bigger, FaaS&#x2F;microservice design makes it easier for the teams to work without blocking each other. I’m sure that same benefits could be achieved in a traditional monolithic server with careful design and control of the development process, but it seems easier and quicker to accomplish with FaaS.<p>Indeed, a simple REST API sometimes requires dozens of handlers. One might worry that this is complicated because each handler is somehow running in a separate container... but that’s really the cloud provider’s problem. Execution is very finely segmented, while logical division of the code-base is generally free to follow natural domain divisions. It’s pure benefit to us: endpoints have excellent isolation. We have excellent control for behavior in overload scenarios.<p>FaaS handlers tend to be simpler than each action in the former monolithic server. With simplicity, it’s easier for us to ensure handlers follow a common set of best practices. With simplicity, consistency, and fine-grained isolation it is easier to reason about the performance and capacity of the system. While there are scenarios where FaaS is prohibitively expensive, our use stays within its sweet spot and is significantly less expensive than running the previous monolithic server.<p>A downside of FaaS is that it quickly became impossible to run the entire system on a developer laptop. We really need to run things on the cloud infrastructure for any kind of integration test. So far, it has been hard for us to provide developers or test infrastructure with independent Integration test sandboxes.

But I&#x27;m not seeing real payoffs for many less-tactical, broad-scale use cases.<p>What appears to happen is the &quot;get going coding&quot; part is dramatically accelerated, that saves on the order of days of waiting; a few weeks&#x2F;months if new tech stacks the organization hasn&#x27;t worked with before are in play. But man, once in production, I&#x27;m still puzzling over how to manage the operational costs.<p>There is a huge disconnect in the business community in their perception of cloud that I&#x27;m collaborating with. They&#x27;re taking the delivered &quot;get coding fast&quot; benefits which do save time and money. They see we&#x27;re only paying for infrastructure the moment devs start hammering fingers to keyboards so to speak, and not waiting around for teams to stand up that infrastructure and paying for all of that while it&#x27;s not delivering benefit. They take that experience and are applying the same expectations to the operational, production support side.<p>I don&#x27;t know how others are doing it delivering on the operational and production support benefits, but nowhere near the same scale of savings are happening so far for teams I work with. What I&#x27;m experiencing is while there are marginal savings on the nodes of services (the actual service itself), we&#x27;re adding a lot to staff payroll at high-end pay scales and spending a lot of their time on all the connections and complexity between them; between troubleshooting and adding new capabilities (more troubleshooting), it is eating up a lot of expensive staff time.<p>I&#x27;m pushing for greater automation through DevOps, but that&#x27;s encountering lots of resistance now with the economic outlook because DevOps generates a net increase in absolute payroll even with a marginal decrease in operational staffing once the automation is burned-in. In fact, because automation takes away the mundane operational aspects, we end up having to cost-justify far more capable and expensive operational staff that can handle the corner-cases that emerge as business-as-usual activity, after automation ate away all the usual cases. While headcount goes down, total payroll goes up, and budget-watchers resist the idea that they&#x27;re saving overall by delivering more stable, consistent, quality service with more feature points per dollar, and if we continue to carry on the old way our costs would be easily triple to order of magnitude more. This is a marketing&#x2F;education perception problem to work upon nearly daily.<p>I love working with the cloud tech stack, but at the end of the day I have to show my business stakeholders it really did save net budget. For judiciously-targeted and considered projects where I&#x27;ve had a lot of input tactically it has worked really well for them and me. For strategic-level &quot;Cloud All The Things!!@!%!&quot; initiatives, the cost savings get way murkier to discern; this is the perception problem on steroids.

For things that require auth, I usually hang a Login &#x2F; Authenticate method off of the Client that does whatever auth is necessary (you can even have multiple if there are multiple strategies). Those authentication methods usually return some kind of Session that has whatever token is ultimately produced as state. Authenticated methods hang off the Session object. EDIT: One other nice consequence of this design is that a separate Session makes it possible to have multiple simultaneous authenticated sessions while still maintaining the ability to call unauthenticated methods (e.g. Ping()).<p>I’ve found this prevents users of the library from having to shuttle around credentials and accidentally calling authenticated endpoints without credentials (since those methods don’t even exist off the Client). Also, if the Client is responsible for managing connections, it can also deal with things like rate limiting and whatnot. Finally, having a separate Session object eases testing, as you don’t have to mock the entirety of the auth flow (think of the complexity of OAuth 2.0) in order to get to a state that you care about. You can simply start with “given an authenticated session...”.<p>There are some other pieces that can be useful too depending on the abstractions available to you in your language of choice.

Why is the API painful to use? Try to address those aspects when creating your client library.<p>Many API&#x27;s are easy enough to understand, they don&#x27;t necessarily get lots of benefit from an official client library. Developers just write the HTTP request code themselves for whichever endpoints they are using. keep it simple if you are first starting.<p>create a separate file, NameAPI.js, to house your endpoint calling functions. Make it easy for the caller to provide necessary values to those functions. Sometimes API endpoints have a lot of extra optional params&#x2F;properties. Don&#x27;t worry about including those in the function interface unless you are actually using them for your use-case--instead choose suitable default params&#x2F;properties whenever possible.<p>Then continue to build out your client functions as you need more endpoints or endpoint features.<p>I would say sometimes its helpful to provide multiple client functions per one endpoint, especially if this endpoint is already loaded with lots of different choices for params&#x2F;properties. EX: ive seen create user endpoints that require a non-descriptive type property like 1 = basic user 2= admin user etc. well, you could have two client functions createUser vs createAdminUser. In this way, you are taking off some of the burden for the caller to figure out which type number they need to pass, and instead giving them natural language functions which configure and run the HTTP request for them.<p>A nice to have: make it easy for the caller to pass properties using host language conventions like property name casing. ex: if the host language is in javascript, it may be easier&#x2F;more consistent for the caller to always provide camelCased params&#x2F;properties to the function, even if the API endpoint expects snake_case for params&#x2F;properties (translate the names for your caller).<p>be clear about how you are handling error conditions in your client functions&#x2F;package. I think of two basic types of error conditions, network errors vs operational errors. Network errors would be when client has not internet connection or times out for whatever reason. Operational error would be when server DOES send back response but its an error response (like 400&#x27;s client provided bad values or 500&#x27;s server is malfunctioning). And will you be throwing errors on network errors AND operational errors? or just throwing on network errors? or not throwing at all (returning some value instead)? basically, how does the caller know when there was an error and what type of error? In Go, i&#x27;ve seen sql clients go through the trouble of returning custom error types for every possible sql error that could happen. That gives the client more potential options to decide how to recover&#x2F;resume.<p>If you are first starting, I honestly wouldn&#x27;t worry about including auth handling within the client. I find it usually confusing more than helpful. But it depends on the protocol and auth method. Perhaps auth IS one of the most painful points of using the API, in that case building some auth management into the client may be helpful. But HTTP + Authorization token is so straightforward and common, developers can manage that auth cred easily in their own way. In that case, just make the token a parameter that must be passed to the client function. That&#x27;s the simplest way to start.<p>Next option might be to allow the caller to create an instance of the client for a specific auth cred. Then the caller can use this instance whenever it needs to call client functions given that auth cred, or create multiple instances each with a separate user&#x2F;service auth cred.<p>if you are hosting this client as a package for others to use in the community, be sure to stay on top of any API changes which necessitate your client package to be updated. Provide clear documentation about any API changes and how your package has addressed them."],"time":["2020-05-23 19:04:34"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jayrot"],"id":[23278147],"kids":[23279138,23278615,23278717,23281777,23278257],"parent":[23271281],"text":["Fun fact, though unrelated: the title 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea refers to the distance traveled while under the sea, not the depth."],"time":["2020-05-23 01:12:00"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["dredmorbius"],"id":[23283909],"kids":{},"parent":[23271281],"text":["Good article, but discussed just 10 days ago.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23153640\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23153640<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-23 17:50:51"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["knolax"],"id":[23291862],"kids":{},"parent":[23271281],"text":["&gt; micromillimetre<p>Somebody doesn&#x27;t know how SI prefixes work."],"time":["2020-05-24 16:46:35"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["AdrianB1"],"id":[23281842],"kids":[23283367,23284552,23282509],"parent":[23280674],"text":["I work for a company that managed to keep an older and very incompetent guy for 15 years doing almost nothing; the guy was an IT technician coming part of an acquisition and they promoted him as manager at the time of the acquisition.

This whole &quot;we haven&#x27;t positively proved it, therefore we have no idea&quot; position that&#x27;s being taken in some corners of the healthcare community is ridiculous, dangerous, and wrong.<p>&gt; Serological tests are unreliable. The volume of testing needed is unfeasible. Tens to hundreds of millions of serological tests would be needed for a national immunity certification programme.<p><i>Some<\/i> serological tests are unreliable. So use the reliable ones, problem solved. The US is doing hundreds of thousands of tests a day. That&#x27;s enough for this program to work.<p>&gt; Too few survivors to boost the economy.<p>This may be true in some areas, but it&#x27;s certainly not true in NYC, where 20% of the population has been infected already. Even if it doesn&#x27;t boost the economy, it&#x27;d allow freedom of movement to people who have recovered - that seems like a valuable thing to me on its own.<p>&gt; Monitoring erodes privacy.<p>No it doesn&#x27;t. Give someone an immunity certificate. If they get stopped outside when they&#x27;re not supposed to be, they present it to the police and go on their way. Just like a drivers license or any form of identification now.<p>&gt; Marginalized groups will face more scrutiny.<p>No. We do not need any extra monitoring to do this. Just take the current system with its current restrictions, and lift the restrictions for people with a certificate of immunity.<p>&gt; Unfair access. With a shortage of testing, many will not have access.<p>First of all, unfair access is a choice. Design the system so it&#x27;s fair, if you&#x27;re worried about that. Second of all, unfair access is not a reason to deny access to everyone.<p>&gt; Societal stratification.<p>This is literally the point. To stratify by recovered&#x2F;immune. If you actually want to get into this, traditionally marginalized groups have been disproportionately infected by this virus, which means they will be disproportionately granted immunity certificates. If anything, this will stratify in the opposite way from &#x27;traditional&#x27; stratification, and that seems like a fine thing to me.<p>&gt; New forms of discrimination<p>This is just a restatement of the last two points.<p>&gt; Threats to public health. Immunity passports could create perverse incentives. If access to certain social and economic liberties is given only to people who have recovered from COVID-19, then immunity passports could incentivize healthy, non-immune individuals to wilfully seek out infection — putting themselves and others at risk<p>Driver&#x27;s licenses create perverse incentives. That&#x27;s not a reason not to issue them. If someone infects themselves with covid to get an immunity passport, that&#x27;s fine, we&#x27;ll just get to herd immunity that much faster.<p>Remember, immunity passports aren&#x27;t putting <i>more<\/i> restrictions on anyone. They&#x27;re just lifting extant restrictions on those who have recovered. This idea that it&#x27;s going to erode privacy or rights is such a crazy false choice I don&#x27;t even know where to begin.

Quarantined files are not allowed to be executed by gatekeeper. It&#x27;s not about a network check, they just can&#x27;t be executed. If the user removes the quarantine attribute, then gatekeeper will shut up and the files will execute normally. Alternatively, if a file has a signed hash stapled to it i.e. if it has been notarized, then gatekeeper will also allow execution after verifying the signature. This doesn&#x27;t require a network check either.<p>Interestingly, the way to bypass the quarantine behavior is to unarchive a folder. Archives themselves include the quarantine attribute, however, files extracted from the archive using a terminal program (a &quot;developer tools&quot; program) don&#x27;t.

Too inflexible and the &quot;Smart&quot; part is laughable (see above). While Amazons and Googles smart speakers are a common sight in many households today, Apple is sitting on the sideline for years.<p>- Laptops: The debacle around their Butterfly Keyboard design was only resolved recently … after almost four years of massive problems. The new 2020 MacBook Air has a thermal design that is weird, to say the least and according to reviewers has heat problems despite being cooled actively, when comparable laptops are cooled passively.(2) The 2020 MacBook Air and the MacBook Pro 13&quot; have screen-to-body ratios that are outdated in comparison with the competition.(3) The MacBook Pro 16&quot; has speaker issues, display issues(4) and may overheat when used with an external display(5).<p>- Desktop Computers: The Mac minis hardware is outdated and its price really isn&#x27;t compelling. If you want to buy a proper external display from Apple to use with your MacBook or Mac desktop (mini&#x2F;pro) and are no Hollywood Studio Video editor that needs a 5000$ XHDR display, you are out of luck.

QBASIC was my very first programming language; I was a nine year old kid who loved computers and would read anything computer-related that was available, including my mom&#x27;s textbooks (she was returning to college at the time and took some courses on computing and applications such as WordPerfect and Lotus 1-2-3) and software manuals.  When we finally got Internet access in 1998 via AOL, I used the message boards to get resources on how to program.  I was recommended to learn QBASIC, and I was told that QBASIC could be found on the Windows 95 install CD.  I remember initially learning QBASIC through some web tutorials.  My mom happened to have a friend who recently took a QBASIC programming course; her friend gave my mom her QBASIC textbook, which my mom then gave to me.<p>I&#x27;m now a researcher at an AI lab in Silicon Valley, and I just finished a five-week stint as a section leader for Stanford&#x27;s CS106A &quot;Code in Place&quot; introductory Python course (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.stanforddaily.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;05&#x2F;07&#x2F;students-instructors-share-thoughts-on-free-course-code-in-place&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.stanforddaily.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;05&#x2F;07&#x2F;students-instructor...<\/a>).

I was an 11 year old in the eighties and attending comprehensive secondary school in the UK.<p>We had a school &#x27;computer room&#x27; which hosted ten BBC Micros. The mathematics teacher at the time ran an after school computer club and it was alleged that the last 30 minutes were unstructured and some students had managed to get a cassette tape copy of Elite (now Elite Dangerous) loaded onto some Micros. This absolutely blew my mind and I had to get in there somehow. The problem was I knew nothing about computers and I had no computer at home to practise on (this was also not likely to change as I was part of a financially stretched single parent family).<p>What I did manage to do however, was get a copy of Computer Weekly from WH Smiths. This particular edition was running a monthly section on &#x27;Programming in Basic&#x27;. Now as said I had no computer, but I was not deterred into letting that stop me, so I wrote my first program on some A4 paper. As with many first time programmers, It was a text based adventure game with a  multiple choice engine:<p>You find yourself facing the dragon. Do you?<p>A, Fight the dragon\nB, Run away\nC, Use the magic potion the elf gave you.\nD, Do nothing.<p>The program itself consisted of nothing more than print statements, capturing user input and then conditionals leading to &quot;goto line X&quot; statements. Quite soon this got hugely un-manageable and I realised this programming stuff was not as easy as I thought. Somehow though, I summoned the confidence to take it to the math teacher for his feedback and thought perhaps he might see some promise in me sufficient to get me into the club. He leafed through a few pages and said I could join. He later told me that he was more impressed that someone would attempt such an effort, more than myself showing any sort of genius.<p>Years later now, that snotty nosed inquisitive 11 year old is now a Principal Engineer with a long career spent building many, many systems with many engineers. I have always remained a software engineer , while colleagues have drifted off into management. I will be honest, I am still as excited about tech as I was when I was young upstart. I am also still all to willing to take risks, fail and bite off more that I can chew. In reflection that sense of false bravado is what has led to my career being as successful as it has been. It&#x27;s never been about how beautiful my code is or how well I understand the deep idiomatic nature of whatever the new language is.

For instance, GIOCOM.ASM has a reference:<p>COMPAQ=0                     ;Include IBM 1.0&#x2F;1.1 Bugs for compatibility<p>But this isn&#x27;t cited anywhere else. It&#x27;s just hanging.

Reason: We&#x27;re not in a language that has a default main file by custom, i.e., C&#x27;s &#x27;main.c&#x27;.  But again, extremely minor...<p>2) This code is great, I mean, absolutely great for someone to learn x86 programming IF they have the prerequisite understanding about how memory is segmented in those early computers (including segment registers, etc.)... Reason: Very few basic x86 instructions are used, relative to the entire x86 instruction set...<p>3) It seems that the assembler which was being used at the time had a limitation of 6 characters per symbol.  This kind of sucks a little bit for the readability of those symbols (but note that the code makes up for this with liberal commenting, which is great!), and of course, with a little bit of effort, you can mentally parse what most of these mean.<p>4) I would have liked to see some kind of document (although, since it&#x27;s 38 years &quot;after-the-fact&quot;, after this program was being written, I certainly don&#x27;t expect one! &lt;g&gt;) which, at a high level, would describe the main data structure being used to hold the lines of basic code (I&#x27;m guessing this would be a linked list of sorts), in what source file that data structure lives, and how it is evaluated when a BASIC program is run...<p><i>Basically, give me the high-level view of the system.<\/i><p>The code itself represents the low-level implementation details of that high-level &quot;as simple as possible but not simpler&quot;, view...<p>But again, those things are minor, relatively speaking, and they only amount to &quot;notes to self&quot; in my future software engineering efforts...<p>Anyway, thanks again to Microsoft for this great important contribution to computer history!!!"],"time":["2020-05-23 08:14:23"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Brajeshwar"],"id":[23268917],"kids":[23268940,23268972],"parent":[23266917],"text":["Perhaps stupid questions but how do they get the commit history to be from 38 years ago at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;microsoft&#x2F;GW-BASIC\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;microsoft&#x2F;GW-BASIC<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-22 07:30:03"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["kerng"],"id":[23267448],"kids":[23267535],"parent":[23266917],"text":["Visual Basic 6 next please! :)"],"time":["2020-05-22 02:40:00"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["wegs"],"id":[23267232],"kids":[23267700],"parent":[23266917],"text":["Awesome!<p>I&#x27;d love QBasic from a few years later.<p>I&#x27;d also love a nice, easy-to-run Ubuntu .deb for either."],"time":["2020-05-22 02:12:30"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["duskwuff"],"id":[23267077],"kids":[23267188,23267265],"parent":[23266917],"text":["Oh, interesting.

If I have a product that in some way let&#x27;s you query time series data, and that product is powered by a TimescaleDB, would that count as providing TimescaleDB-as-a-service?<p>I used to work for Heap which is an analytics tool. In a way you can view Heap as just a wrapper around Postgres. We stored event data in Postgres and provided a UI that allowed you to express queries (e.g. count the number of logins over the past month). We would take the query in the UI, compile it into a SQL query, and run the SQL against Postgres. If Heap was powered by TimescaleDB, would that violate the Timescale License? In fact, you could technically view any dashboarding product that queries TimescaleDB as providing &quot;TimescaleDB-as-a-service&quot;.<p>I looked at the actual license[0] to see what it says, and it seems really unclear. The license gives you permission to use TimescaleDB to develop &quot;Value Added Products or Services&quot; which it defines as a product that uses TimescaleDB as part of a larger offering. One of the requirements for a product or service to be considered &quot;Value Added&quot; is:<p>&gt; (ii) such value-added products or services add substantial value of a different nature to the time-series database storage and operations afforded by the Timescale Software and are the key functions upon which such products or services are offered and marketed<p>This seems incredibly vague. What exactly does &quot;substantial value of a different nature&quot; mean? In the end, tons of products are just wrappers around DBs. If products like Heap or Datadog were to be backed by TimescaleDB, would they add &quot;substantial value of a different nature&quot; on top of it? In the end, Heap and Datadog are products designed for querying time series data. I could definitely make a case that they don&#x27;t provide value of a different nature from TimescaleDB. This vagueness seems like a huge risk and without further clarification, makes me want to stay far away from TimescaleDB.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;timescale&#x2F;timescaledb&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;tsl&#x2F;LICENSE-TIMESCALE\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;timescale&#x2F;timescaledb&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;tsl&#x2F;LIC...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-22 18:32:20"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["thesausageking"],"id":[23273782],"kids":[23274621],"parent":[23272992],"text":["What&#x27;s the difference between Timescale&#x27;s license (&quot;free to everyone except cloud providers&quot;) and GPLv3?"],"time":["2020-05-22 18:24:27"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["anonymousDan"],"id":[23273759],"kids":[23273892],"parent":[23272992],"text":["I think this is a good move.

Perhaps their strategy is to drive adoption and letting people try their feature out, hoping that some of these adoptors will end up using their managed solution. I checked their pricing, and the delta between their pricing and the underlying AWS instance seems quite reasonable.<p>We ended up testing Influx first, because it seems to be a safe choice with wider adoption and extensive documentation.<p>With Influx, it was very easy to put together a prototype quickly. But once we started throwing some real workload at it, it would lose writes under load. But it makes sense that it failed, because according to Influx&#x27;s documentation (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.influxdata.com&#x2F;influxdb&#x2F;v1.8&#x2F;guides&#x2F;hardware_sizing&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.influxdata.com&#x2F;influxdb&#x2F;v1.8&#x2F;guides&#x2F;hardware_si...<\/a>), we would need cluster to make it work. Influx is very transparent in their documentation that writes and queries will fail immediately when a server is unavailable without cluster.<p>This isn&#x27;t to say that Influx wouldn&#x27;t work for other use cases. But at least in our use case, their open source offering isn&#x27;t suitable for us, and it&#x27;s unclear how much better the cluster version is.<p>Timescale, on the other hand, was able to handle the same workload under stress. As we are unable to backfill some of the ingressing data, it&#x27;s quite vital that the system can degrade more gracefully.<p>For my use case, one feature that still need some work in Timescale is their real time aggregation. It is currently impossible to define a rollup on top of another rollup, which means that if you are ingesting a lot of data into the raw table, and you down sample into a wide time bucket (e.g. a day, or week), queries against these wider buckets will potentially ended up having to query a lot of data points, slowing the system down considerably. Granted, it is a new feature that just got released about a month ago. Hopefully, with multi-node nearing completion, continuous aggregation will get a bit more love.<p>I spoke with their engineers about this over Slack, and their suggestion was to manually modify the rollup materialized view to aggregate over a combination of the materialized buckets (currently handled by the continuous aggregation) + real time aggregation from a higher resolution bucket.<p>We are still testing out Timescale, of course. But so far, it&#x27;s been holding up its end of the bargain. The fact that Timescale is &quot;just an extension&quot; built for Postgres also makes it a less risky choice and offers a lot of flexibility; if Timescale doesn&#x27;t work out, we could still work with Postgres, and that IMHO is a very nice thing."],"time":["2020-05-23 06:47:40"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["korjavin"],"id":[23281721],"kids":{},"parent":[23272992],"text":["We switched to cluster version of VictoriaMetrics, and we are very happy about it."],"time":["2020-05-23 12:15:50"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["EGreg"],"id":[23273311],"kids":{},"parent":[23272992],"text":["So does this mean anyone can join this giant snowball?<p>Like IPFS or MaidSAFE or Dat or Bittorrent?"],"time":["2020-05-22 17:45:34"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["xyst"],"id":[23273315],"kids":[23273477],"parent":[23272992],"text":["If this is just postgresql, why would I use this implementation over postgresql?<p>It also seems like it scales linearly with some decrease in ROI after 12 nodes."],"time":["2020-05-22 17:46:14"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["valyala"],"id":[23275649],"kids":{},"parent":[23272992],"text":["Multi-node TimescaleDB is a great contribution to open source world!<p>BTW, it would be great comparing multi-node TimescaleDB to VictoriaMetrics cluster [1], which is licensed under vanilla Apache2 open source license [2].<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;VictoriaMetrics&#x2F;VictoriaMetrics&#x2F;blob&#x2F;cluster&#x2F;README.md\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;VictoriaMetrics&#x2F;VictoriaMetrics&#x2F;blob&#x2F;clus...<\/a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;VictoriaMetrics&#x2F;VictoriaMetrics&#x2F;blob&#x2F;cluster&#x2F;LICENSE\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;VictoriaMetrics&#x2F;VictoriaMetrics&#x2F;blob&#x2F;clus...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-22 20:59:37"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["neonate"],"id":[23275949],"kids":[23325427,23277851,23278897],"parent":[23271572],"text":["<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.md&#x2F;NVWOo\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.md&#x2F;NVWOo<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-22 21:29:29"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["dayvid"],"id":[23277704],"kids":[23279165,23278162,23280113,23277988,23277744,23279137,23278243,23277998,23278024],"parent":[23271572],"text":["I&#x27;ve been doing breathing exercises regularly for the past 8 years.

I don&#x27;t know how much of your breathing is recognized by other humans, but having been around animals most of my life, I&#x27;ve realized they perceive how you are breathing at the moment as a signal of what you are thinking. If you suddenly hold your breath, you are tense. You may not even be aware you are doing it. If you release the air in your lungs and breath out, you are relaxing. These are 2 of the strongest cues that animals react to. If you&#x27;re curious, the next time your around an animal, experiment with it. Try steady in and out breathing, then subtly hold your breath for a moment, then exhale loudly, and see if and how the animal responds."],"time":["2020-05-23 14:20:24"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["nishnik"],"id":[23277195],"kids":[23278390,23283275],"parent":[23271572],"text":["The book : Oxygen advantage[1] makes similar points.\nIt points out to the research of why swimmers have higher life expectancy than the average athelete, why almost all of us are hyperventilating.

Check your breathing and slow it down. Maybe throw in some alternate nostril breathing, though I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the distraction that does it or the breathing. Light asthma attack and wheezing? Check your breathing, slow it down, maybe add some pursed lip exhalations. Major asthma attack?
