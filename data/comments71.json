The master tells them that the mind, neither the flag nor the wind, is what is moving.<p>Both sides of the interpretative coin are needed. We must simultaneously understand that QM is epistemic and also that QM is contextual. The author asks,<p>&gt; How do probabilities get into QM?<p>Because knowledge of physical systems is always limited and QM is epistemic, all quantities we manipulate in QM are probabilistic. Further, the Kochen-Specker Theorem requires that some measurements be not fully determined by past history, as a matter of living in at least three dimensions of space. Finally, basic linear logic allows us to replicate most of QM&#x27;s effects with macrostates.<p>While Schrödinger hated this and used his famous cat thought-experiment to try to refute it, children learn about linear logic and probabilities in macrostates when they are given random toys or packs of trading cards, and today we recognize that it really is possible to condition relatively large differences in macrostate observations on single entangled or otherwise-prepared microstates.<p>&gt; In the [Everett] realist approach the history of the world is endlessly splitting;<p>Eh, kind of? But it&#x27;s also endlessly joining. We wouldn&#x27;t just be in a &quot;cosmic history&quot; which is &quot;sufficiently benign&quot; for us, but also we&#x27;re likely to be in a likely history. In fact, we&#x27;re <i>exactly<\/i> as likely to be on our current path as our current path is to be randomly picked from amongst the possible paths. So it turns out that Everett&#x27;s many-worlds analysis is a little tautological.<p>&gt; But how can something so nonlocal represent reality?<p>Finally, a good deep question. There are two parts to the answer, and each are deep enough to warrant a series of lectures. First, the Kochen-Specker Theorem, combined with general relativity, leads to the Free Will Theorem: When we measure particles, we are sending them a query, and they choose how to respond to the query from among the possible replies. Second, reality isn&#x27;t one single fabric, but interlocking systems of geometry and topology. With apologies to Wheeler, geometry tells reality how to interact, and topology tells reality how to propagate information.

Specific impulse could max out at ~12,000 seconds, drastically higher than the roughly 2,000 s from current hall thrusters. VASIMR creates thrust through a multi-step process. First, it bombards a neutral gas with RF energy in helical waves to ionize the gas and create plasma (it can use multiple gases: argon, hydrogen, or even CO2). Then, it uses magnetic fields and an additional RF coupler to contain and energize the plasma to a superheated state (in the neighborhood of the temperature of the Sun’s core). Finally, a magnetic nozzle ejects the plasma at exceptionally high velocity.

App-based service-delivery companies aren’t developing silicon chips like Intel or AMD, creating consumer software like Adobe, or making networking switches like Cisco.

I think in general you run into this sort of thing a lot if you try to either treat Rust as a functional programming language like OCaml, or are writing the sort of thing that inherently benefits from garbage collection.  However, there is actually a trick that can (if you don&#x27;t need cleanup) both improve your performance and give you back pattern matching: allocate your nodes in something like <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.rs&#x2F;typed-arena&#x2F;2.0.1&#x2F;typed_arena&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.rs&#x2F;typed-arena&#x2F;2.0.1&#x2F;typed_arena&#x2F;<\/a> instead of as Rcs.  Doing this (especially if you tend to stick to immutable stuff, but even if you don&#x27;t if you&#x27;re careful) can make using Rust for manipulating ASTs and stuff a lot more pleasant (though it does have other tradeoffs, obviously, and you usually end up needing both kinds of representation at different points--which I guess speaks to your point about there being way too many ways to do things and too many rules about how to do them)."],"time":["2020-08-20 18:19:28"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jbandela1"],"id":[24224968],"kids":[24225571,24225615,24236024],"parent":[24223018],"text":["&gt; You put everything in a Box::new (regular heap memory) or RC::new (reference counted memory) or Arc::new (reference counted memory suitable to be used concurrently in different threads), and then when they go out of scope they&#x27;ll be cleaned up.<p>Please don’t. This is probably one of the biggest mistakes I see in people coming from languages with garbage collection to languages like Rust or C++. They attempt to use smart pointers as a replacement for garbage collection.<p>The idiomatic use of these languages is that unless you have a good reason not to, just put the variable on the stack. This will make your program shorter, easier to reason about, and potentially faster due to memory locality.<p>The rough guideline I have heard for C++ which likely applies to Rust is that 90% of your variables should be on the stack.

From that experience I have made two observations:<p>1.  These people are not idiots (at least the YECs aren&#x27;t, I can&#x27;t speak for the flat-earthers) and to dismiss them as idiots who will just go away is a serious mistake.  They are <i>very<\/i> good at presenting convincing-sounding arguments, and refuting them can actually be quite challenging.<p>2.  The root of their reasoning is a tacit acceptance of teleology, which cannot be <i>logically<\/i> refuted.  They approach existential questions with the <i>assumption<\/i> that there has to be some kind of point to existence, some transcendent meaning or purpose.  If you accept this premise, then there is actually a logically defensible line of reasoning that leads you to Christianity and thence to the inerrancy of the Bible, and thence to YEC (and even a flat earth if you&#x27;re really being intellectually honest!)  A failure to appreciate this is IMHO one of the reasons that the secular world is having such a hard time effectively resisting these movements.  A life without purpose makes no sense to these people, just as a theory at odds with the data makes no sense to someone with a scientific mindset.  So if science leads you to the conclusion that life has no transcendent purpose (and it does) then, on their world-view, science must be wrong, full stop.

Because much of her graduate work involved building pairs of knots that were different but shared some 4-D properties, she already knew that any two knots that share the same 4-D space also share sliceness — they’re either both slice or both not slice. Since her goal was to prove that the Conway knot wasn’t slice, her first step was come up with an entirely different knot with the same four-dimensional space, she explains. “Then I’ll try to show that the other knot isn’t slice.”<p>&gt; She spent spare time over the next several days hand-sketching and manipulating configurations of the 4-D space occupied by the Conway knot. “I didn’t allow myself to work on it during the day,” she told Quanta Magazine earlier this year, “because I didn’t consider it to be real math. I thought it was, like, my homework.”<p>&gt; The next step was to try to prove that the knot she drew was not slice. “There are lots of tools already in the literature for doing that,” she says. She would feed the knot iterations into a computer, “and based on the data of the knot, maybe based on how its crossings look or other data that you can pull from the knot, the algorithm spits out an integer.” In less than a week, Piccirillo had created a knot that hit the sweet spot: It had the same 4-D properties as the Conway knot, and it was found by the algorithm to be not slice.<p>&gt; She had suddenly succeeded where countless mathematicians had failed for five decades.

Apple is almost certainly going to remove the ability to run unsigned code in the future.<p>A day or two I wrote[0] about the timeline that took Facebook from guaranteeing that you&#x27;d never need to sign into an account on Oculus to requiring a Facebook account on Oculus. Different company, same story.<p>We spent a long time having concerns dismissed, and then once everyone was used to the idea and the uproar had been reduced to a manageable level, Facebook did it. People get told that they&#x27;re paranoid when they express concerns about the future. Then those concerns turn out to be correct, but by then the concerns seems less dystopian, and we&#x27;ve moved on to dismissing other concerns even farther down the road.<p>I&#x27;m not going to find the other threads and articles, but:<p>Voice assistants: same story different companies. Concerns about recordings leaking, being distributed outside of the company to 3rd-party contractors were all paranoia until they weren&#x27;t.<p>Facebook, again: same story different company. Facebook would need to be stupid to use 2-factor phone numbers for advertising and promotion services, the people worrying about that scenario were paranoid. Until they were proven right.<p>Browsers: same story different companies. You can not run unsigned extensions in Chrome. You can not run unsigned extensions in Firefox unless you are on the beta-version developer branch.

(I omit the points where I lack experience.)<p>1; Motion planning<p>&quot;Even things like a model of where the robot is, with respect to the surroundings&quot; That&#x27;s not motion planing. Motion planing starts from when you have a model of yourself and your surrounding. There are theoretical challenges (imagine a flytrap, or maze) but the real world challenges in my experience come from that under the inaccuracies and glitchyness of perception you are expected to make okay-ish decisions.<p>3; SLAM<p>&quot;there’s always going to be new obstacles (a pair of shoes, a book)&quot;<p>SLAM is about localisation. It gives you a 6dof pose from some fixed coordinate system. It does not deal with tripping hazards. That&#x27;s obstacle detection. It does indeed deal with &quot;mapping&quot; but only in as much as to get you that pose estimate.<p>&quot;not turn-key to where there would be a SLAM module you can buy for your robot.&quot;<p>Sure you can. The &quot;Intel Realsense t265&quot; is for example one such a module.<p>The inside-out tracking of the Oculus Quest is an other (albeit one you will have hard time buying for your robot.)<p>6; Depth estimation.<p>That one is odd. True, getting full fidelity depth maps out of monocular images is a research problem. But if in reality you want to estimate the distance to your beer bottle you will use stereo images, or a Kinect like depth sensor. It is obviously a hard engineering challenge to make it four 9 robust, but not an unheard of challenge. If his definition of an &quot;open problem&quot; is that there are people writing research papers about it then it will remain an open problem for a while. But if he just wants to depth estimate stuff, then there are already working good ways. Maybe cost prohibitive, maybe not robust enough for his liking.<p>9; Scene understanding<p>Humanity made insane leaps and bounds on this one. Again there are engineering tradeoffs.

This has a few implications :<p>1. A mobile site (e.g. on mobile Safari) can&#x27;t entice a user to view articles when Reddit wants them to. In other words, &quot;I&quot; open reddit when &quot;I&quot; want to.<p>2. I haven&#x27;t accessed mobile site in a while but (hopefully) it won&#x27;t have infinite scrolling which means I tire quickly of clicking &quot;Next&quot; and leave the site. An app removes this possibility<p>3. As alluded in #1, an app can have all sorts of notifications which entice me to access reddit a lot more \nand can possibly track a lot more than a browser will allow.

Also, it allows them to piggyback on the Pavlovian response that has been conditioned in your brain by smart phone companies.

The larger their user population, the more diverse their user base is and the harder it gets to cater to the needs of each type of user. The folks commenting here are a vocal minority, an important one given many people here are probably early adopters and also have the skills needed to build a Reddit competitor, but it&#x27;s hard to see the reactions of this minority on a dashboard. A problem worth solving IMO but non trivial.<p>Typically initiatives like this come from a team within the company who&#x27;s objective is to improve a key metric, in this case let&#x27;s say user engagement. Some individual in the team probably spotted the trend that users on the app are more engaged than users on mobile web browsers. They then launched an experiment to test getting users over to the mobile app. Many users who end up on reddit via SEO probably don&#x27;t know that reddit has an app and on seeing this end up downloading the app which makes them more engaged with reddit. Overall on the dashboard this shows up as a win where user engagement in the enabled group is up compared to the control and given that they give users an option to continue using the web app there is not a significant user drop. At this point, a decision needs to be made on whether to ship this change or not to ship. Folks making this decision do understand that it might be annoying to some people but the data in this case overwhelmingly supports a ship decision. They talk about it, mention their reservations, but eventually make a decision given the data and don&#x27;t think about it anymore. They also don&#x27;t have to feel the pain as most employees have the reddit app installed and don&#x27;t see this again and again.<p>The key thing to know here is that there are lots of incentives in the company to make this decision a ship decision vs a no-ship decision - the data, the success of the team, the success of the individual who pioneered this change but there is not enough evidence or visible push from users to not make this change. Let&#x27;s say there are some customer reports for this but unless they reach a very high volume no one is going to notice it.<p>Posts and discussions like this are actually a great way to get your word known to companies. This will probably stir a conversation in the team that made this change and hopefully bring out some change in the experience. Don&#x27;t expect it to go away but maybe they will remember your preference of not wanting to use the app."],"time":["2020-08-19 21:11:28"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["RocketSyntax"],"id":[24215829],"kids":{},"parent":[24208958],"text":["Especially when you can redirect to apps or open apps with links"],"time":["2020-08-19 22:21:57"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["HeavyStorm"],"id":[24211882],"kids":{},"parent":[24208958],"text":["I do like the app, but the prompts are completely abnoxious."],"time":["2020-08-19 18:02:47"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["samstave"],"id":[24210848],"kids":{},"parent":[24208958],"text":["I only exclusively use old.reddit.com in browser on mobile."],"time":["2020-08-19 16:41:54"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["SeanBean62"],"id":[24209788],"kids":{},"parent":[24208958],"text":["I’m done with Reddit- please somehow keep this thing going"],"time":["2020-08-19 14:42:42"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["satisfaction"],"id":[24210243],"kids":{},"parent":[24208958],"text":["I still use old.reddit.com. new reddit is sooooooooo slow"],"time":["2020-08-19 15:41:20"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ptman"],"id":[24210030],"kids":{},"parent":[24208958],"text":["Lemmy is an interesting federated alternative to reddit."],"time":["2020-08-19 15:17:41"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["frozenlettuce"],"id":[24209776],"kids":{},"parent":[24208958],"text":["The app interface is optimized to serve ads, not content"],"time":["2020-08-19 14:41:02"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ykevinator"],"id":[24209482],"kids":{},"parent":[24208958],"text":["I think it&#x27;s because they want push notifications"],"time":["2020-08-19 13:55:24"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["arkanciscan"],"id":[24212851],"kids":{},"parent":[24208958],"text":["Because we live in the worst possible timeline"],"time":["2020-08-19 19:10:35"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["knob"],"id":[24209289],"kids":{},"parent":[24208958],"text":["Try this: old.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;$foo<p>A little bit cleaner."],"time":["2020-08-19 13:30:50"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["honksillet"],"id":[24214325],"kids":{},"parent":[24208958],"text":["If you must use Reddit, use Alien Blue."],"time":["2020-08-19 20:40:32"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["otabdeveloper4"],"id":[24209684],"kids":{},"parent":[24208958],"text":["To collect your data and show you ads."],"time":["2020-08-19 14:27:49"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["WMCRUN"],"id":[24216324],"kids":{},"parent":[24208958],"text":["While we’re at it, have you met Yelp?"],"time":["2020-08-19 22:56:15"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mottiden"],"id":[24209465],"kids":{},"parent":[24208958],"text":["To sell you more targeted ads, sadly"],"time":["2020-08-19 13:53:24"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["negina"],"id":[24216346],"kids":{},"parent":[24208958],"text":["To get your data through the app."],"time":["2020-08-19 22:58:06"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["michelb"],"id":[24211362],"kids":{},"parent":[24208958],"text":["Harder to block ads in the app."],"time":["2020-08-19 17:26:14"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["1024core"],"id":[24212337],"kids":{},"parent":[24208958],"text":["Reddit is busy building a Trumpian wall around itself.

People in gyms are adults and can theoretically stay 6-ft away from each other and wear a mask. I&#x27;ve seen high-impact classes like kick-boxing being held outside in parks for better airflow. Driving activities underground however, has well understood unintended consequences of causing violence and disregard of health rules, as we know from prohibition in the 20&#x27;s and the drug war since the 70&#x27;s.<p>The uniquely American issue, is with bars and clubs being closed. In the land of big houses, everyone knows someone with a bar in their backyard or basement. Keeping bars closed now, when everyone is fed up with the social isolation (sorry, Zoom doesn&#x27;t cut it) just means actual underground speakeasies serving alcohol aka house parties. Where dedicated gym rats <i>aren&#x27;t<\/i> drinking alcohol at the same time they&#x27;re at the gym (it hurts gainz), and are <i>can<\/i> be more responsible for their actions, people on alcohol <i>can&#x27;t<\/i>.

By making it required at bars, you get around some of the privacy issues since those that don&#x27;t want to, can just not go to bars. Using bluetooth-based tracing gets around issues of using GPS-based tracking, and also helps amplify the effectiveness of an under-funded contact tracing corps by providing a technology based solution.<p>This is imperfect, but perfect is the enemy of the good, and even done imperfectly, contact tracing can very successfully drive Re (the local effective value calculated from a diseases&#x27; R0) down below 1, at which point the disease doesn&#x27;t continue to spread and the pandemic can be controlled. For a disease like COVID-19 with an R0 of 2.5, it doesn&#x27;t take too much to drive it down."],"time":["2020-08-19 19:32:00"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["auganov"],"id":[24216258],"kids":{},"parent":[24211414],"text":["I&#x27;m no fan of lockdowns, but comparisons to the prohibition of alcohol in America are appeals to political mythology.

But has anyone considered whether stay-at-home orders have actually saved lives overall?<p>The UN estimated [0][1] that between 83 million and 132 million people will go hungry around the world because of anti-COVID measures.  Some of these people will die from starvation or malnutrition.  Some of them will die from other preventable health problems later in life.<p>According to the Stop TB Partnership, a three-month lockdown followed by a gradual return to normal over 10 months could result in an additional 6.3 million cases of tuberculosis and 1.4 million deaths between 2020 and 2025. [2][3]<p>It&#x27;s also plausible that lockdowns could lead to hundreds of thousands of additional deaths from each of HIV&#x2F;AIDS [4], malaria [5], and several other diseases, though I&#x27;m not as confident about these numbers.<p>I am sure someone will be tempted to respond with some variant on &quot;we could have avoided these deaths by tuning the stay-at-home restrictions more competently.&quot;  Of course, that&#x27;s true; but the point is that <i>we didn&#x27;t<\/i>.  We never do.  Historically, every society that has tried to eliminate &quot;non-essential&quot; jobs through central planning has eventually found that even when the planners operate with the very best of intentions, they still make mistakes.  Dealing with one problem causes a cascade of other subtle changes with real, harmful consequences, which are harder to mitigate when people aren&#x27;t allowed to freely choose how to spend their own resources.  Meanwhile, problems that are judged to be less important are forgotten, because planners can only focus on a limited number of tasks at one time.  Human societies are incredibly complex.  Trying to manage them from the top is like developing software using the waterfall model: it would work perfectly with perfect planning, but we all know how that works out in real life.<p>On a personal level: a relative passed away from cancer recently.  Cancer isn&#x27;t a good way to die at the best of times; and I&#x27;ll be honest, she almost certainly would not have survived even with better medical treatment.  But if hospitals hadn&#x27;t shut down &quot;elective&quot; and &quot;non-essential&quot; care, she could have gone through a lot less pain and suffering.

The managers are the customers in this arrangement, and customers often want silly things, like your physical presence in the office, because perhaps that just makes them feel better, and it’s fine if some silly thing makes your customer feel better.<p>The broader issue he’s talking about is simply the inefficiency of large organisations. There are many things that start to become much less efficient the more you scale up the size of an organisation, including risk management. This is because the feedback loops between decision and outcome starts to get much longer, the causal relationship between decision and outcome starts to become much more blurry, the distance between decision maker and impacted user gets bigger, and management starts to be comprised of less leaders and more bureaucrats.<p>Not only is this unavoidable, but it’s a good thing. Large businesses benefit from the economies of scale, but smaller organisations get to compete with them, because smaller organisations have the potential to be orders of magnitude more efficient than large ones. It also creates market opportunities for other B2B companies to come along and address some of their efficiency issues. I’ve done lots of consulting and contractor work, and one of the primary factors that drives demand for my services is enterprise inefficiency. Even if you put aside any consideration for how slow they are to adapt to new technology, a lot of demand for my contracts has been driven by strict corporate salary bands.

It is good to have solid corporate policy, but not so good if it was written without proper forethought, and even worse if they do not have a mechanism to change it.<p>I work in this arena, in the public sector, and COVID brought massive fast changes to policy. But the public sector also already has mechanisms in place to regularly change it - regular board and city council meetings, specifically. And most organizations have a specific cadence on which they review and update their policies.<p>But the corporate world varies - sometimes the board sets policy, sometimes the execs, sometimes a compliance officer. Whomever it is, they need to not just write policy once and forget it - they need to treat it as a living body of documents, responsive to changes in their environment. Some companies are good at this, some are not.<p>I don&#x27;t buy the conclusion of the article, though, that the leaders don&#x27;t know enough to make decisions and policy becomes a way to entrench arbitrary rules and escape blame. Risk management and compliance are not about making life easy for the individual contributors. They are about looking at big picture risks such as litigation, regulatory compliance, and business continuity. They then set policy to be sure that well-meaning people who don&#x27;t have visibility into those high-level concerns don&#x27;t just make up their own rules. Yes, it puts some pain on us workers. But reduces risk. It is their job to choose those trade-offs.<p>That being said, not everyone is good at it, and there does need to be solid communication in the organization to let them know what problems a policy causes, so they can decide whether or not to adjust it.

Working out is rewarding and worthwhile, for me it&#x27;s something I look forward to every day.

There appears to be no leg resistance and&#x2F;or emphasis on leg training. I would be careful in how you present this in your messaging.<p>3. I would position this as an intro to working out and partner with someone (if you can) like AthleanX.com which is are science based &#x2F; physical trainer designed full body workouts. The reason I would try that is because you will likely have 2 outcomes of your users. Outcome 1 - they&#x27;ll play it for a while, feel good about themselves and stop, or they&#x27;ll maybe finish the full game experience, and stop. Outcome 2 is someone that really gets into this, sees some  transformation of their upper body and wants to move on to a &#x27;real full body workout&#x27; (which sorry this is not). That kind of partnership would be a win-win for both parties because it&#x27;s a bit tough to jump right into a typical full body workout (esp. the AltheanX stuff which is really aimed at elite athletes), and having something like this as any easy onboarding process could be pretty cool.

It looks kind of fun, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d believe people will pay $200 up front and then $120&#x2F;year to play this game. My big concern is that you&#x27;re not clear on where this falls between an exercise service and a fun video game.<p>* Multiplayer boxing is fun, but it&#x27;s not going to be that much different than wii boxing or whatever VR equivalents are out there now. It&#x27;s definitely not a noteworthy exercise tool.<p>* peloton sells a lifestyle w&#x2F; live classes. You&#x27;re selling a video game. I think it&#x27;s misleading yourselves to think about this as a subscription product because I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be able to do much in the way of interesting content over time. You&#x27;re much closer to ring fit adventure. Your main competitors, if released right now would be Fitness Boxing on the Switch and BoxVR. I don&#x27;t know these games, but they turned up on a quick google. Reading through some of the other comments of people who are optimistic about this concept, they don&#x27;t seem to know about these titles either, which is probably cause for concern.<p>* Making it a fantasy story based game is fun... but now you&#x27;re locking in your target market to people who like those kinds of things and decisively not doing an &quot;exercise&quot; or &quot;hardcore&quot; aesthetic. I&#x27;m concerned that&#x27;s not a big overlap with people who want to pay for an exercise service. Ring Fit adventure is kind of close to this and it sold 4 million units, so its not a BAD decision, but its a stark contrast to all of the value props that something like peloton pushes<p>* you say gesture recognition. I think a lot of people are expecting hand tracking and will be disappointed. I&#x27;m concerned you added spells because there&#x27;s just not enough variety on the punches.<p>* doesn&#x27;t look like you have any people with game dev experience on the team.<p>* kickboxing is a fun stretch goal but realistically I see nothing but difficulty in implementing that.<p>* I think it will be difficult to make a boxing game that people want to play every day for a long time. You said hundreds of enemies in your video. I think that&#x27;s highly unlikely to happen. That&#x27;s a huge huge challenge for any game dev shop. Judging from the clips, I don&#x27;t think you really know how the game works. That is, how the player chooses what actions to take, and what creates the difficulty. Off the top of my head, the ways you can make a boxing game are puzzles &#x2F; patterns (punch out), rhythm, ring fit-just-do-reps-and-follow-prompts style, and then something dynamic like wii boxing. Which of those can you choose and make a game that is compelling enough to play every day? Wii boxing sounds enticing but its really quite difficult to make a substantial game out of this.

Online learning is a poor substitute for classroom learning.<p>2. Online learning is much harder on parents and kids.<p>3. We&#x27;re in the middle of a pandemic, in a country that has handled it very poorly.<p>4. Israel tried opening schools in May, when their daily new cases were at an all time low. New cases skyrocketed after opening schools [1], with nearly 50% of new cases being traced back to schools[2].<p>5. Closing schools in the spring is estimated to have saved 40,000 deaths in the US[3].
