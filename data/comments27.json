I live alone. Great family and friends but over the past few months I was completely isolated.<p>One morning, I felt a tickle in my throat, I was able to tell myself that it was just from post nasal drip and not COVID related. Well, later that night I started to experience shortness of breath, chest tightness&#x2F;pain. Then, my limbs started to tingle and go numb and lastly my face.<p>I walked outside for one and a half hours at 10:00 PM, identifying three sounds, three sights and three body parts. I finally calmed myself down from what I learned was an anxiety attack. I suffered multiple episodes of this for 5-6 nights. It was almost always triggered by a thought that I couldn’t breathe or I wasn’t getting enough air or that my chest was tight. It got to the point where I couldn’t function, broke down into tears and at twenty-six years old, I went back to my parents house.<p>I have been here for about a month. I had a couple minor episodes here, my parents were able to talk me out of it. I was also prescribed medication for the anxiety (so far this has been a tremendous help). One day, I didn’t feel anxious at all but I noticed that I couldn’t take a full deep breath most of the time. My parents told me it’s allergies, but the thought in the back of my mind that it was the virus or worse was always there.<p>I called my doctor again, he prescribed me singulair. It’s helped considerably but every time now that I take a deep breath I am extra thoughtful about it. I’ve been meditating and doing breathing exercises as often as I remember now and it has helped.<p>That being said, even if I don’t actually get the virus, this virus has taken a toll on me and my mental health. The isolation, not being in an office and hypochondria have negatively impacted me in ways I never would have imagined.

We had made the game in 9 weeks which was very fast from ATV Offroad, adding snowmobiles for the &quot;slednecks&quot; as they are called.  The game launched and while we were working on our next game, we tuned into the keynote as all devs did in 2010, it was Jan 27, 2010, we saw our game come up on stage and no one knew it was happening.  It was one of those killer moments that made the work worth it. Turns out it was largely because Steve Jobs was on the board at ABC&#x2F;Disney and ESPN properties got promoted.<p>We later made the first game on Apple GameCenter matchup&#x2F;networking in Ricky Carmichael&#x27;s Motocross Matchup. The early versions of the Apple systems were actually quite solid for matchup&#x2F;networking.  This was before Android had Google Game Play Services so we eventually swapped it for a platform agnostic networking system but still lots of fun.<p>I was lucky enough to be lead game dev on both and got to help with the direction&#x2F;game design as well especially on Ricky Carmichael&#x27;s Motocross Matchup which is still pretty high up in racing on iOS.<p>Overall, I really feel iOS was a more solid&#x2F;robust platform back then and trailed off after iOS 6 in terms of speed&#x2F;quality, I think that has alot to do with Scott Forstall.<p>I think Scott Forstall was required for Steve Jobs to really make NeXT and iPhone happen.

So, from a business perspective, when you want to build your match3 or hyper casual title, there&#x27;s no much of a choice in terms of engine."],"time":["2020-05-22 16:50:38"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["moron4hire"],"id":[23277847],"kids":{},"parent":[23271973],"text":["I&#x27;ve spent the last three years working in Unity.

Took a while to figure that one out. After figuring that out, I was able to remove that lock file manually, enabling me to start Unity again. That alone in itself already seems ridiculous. However, I could still not use it, because it kept crashing and not working. So my friend and I could not participate at all. She was running some Mac laptop, where it also had issues. I tried reinstalling multiple times, updating graphics card drivers, switching between proprietary and Nouveau, all kinds of shenanigans, I tried for at least 2 hours to get this stuff working before giving up.

It is a mess.<p>There has never been a time in Unity where systems aren&#x27;t changing.<p>APIs should be simple facades to ugly systems underneath, abstracting away the pain, but Unity puts it right in your face. Their editor is pushed over code first solutions.<p>I thought when they went subscription that it would calm down, as before that it was a mad rush to justify you upgrading to the next version. It has only gotten worse.  From the dual particle systems (which Shuriken wasn&#x27;t even code accessible for a time), killing off simple legacy animation APIs, the UI years and years of delay and still not really as good as NGUI in terms of simplicity and mobile performance, the multiplayer systems have never been great they should have just kept RakNet&#x2F;enet based reliable UDP and been done with it only Photon is worth it, the bulky editor first solutions that really should be code first and then editors that use that and on and on.<p>Compare that with Unreal that is wonderful in terms of networking&#x2F;replication, solid platform that is C++ first, decent platform support, Unity has more but lots of issues.<p>Unity is what we develop most games on but Unreal starting to become more regular. Unity is caught in a pickle. Unreal is winning high end, Unity wants to be them, but they are leaving their smaller developers that do mobile&#x2F;2D&#x2F;simple 3D and making everything overly complex, while Godot is out there taking that space. I&#x27;d be worried if I was Unity. They still win on platforms available and they are making good efforts, but right now, and many times in Unity&#x27;s history, there are so many systems now that it isn&#x27;t simple for the low end, and high end you&#x27;d be amiss to not go with Unreal. This is coming from a Unity developer since 2008 Unity 2, before they even had Unity iPhone, back when it was just WebPlayer (which I miss the simplicity) and Desktop.<p>Unreal is doing high end much better than Unity [1] and Unity is losing what made it hit huge, mobile, web and desktop games and simplicity.  At this point Unreal is more simple because the systems work and there aren&#x27;t these one direction only changes or dual system problems. So much of the Unity API is in flux right now and you never know if they are going to drop them.  UI was worked on for YEARS and now they are doing UIComponents and don&#x27;t even try trusting a Unity networking solution.<p>Back in 2013 Unity was going to go C++ [2] and I wish they had, it was when Apple forced AOT on everyone and they backed off but Unity went into IL2CPP just a year or so before Mono was bought by Microsoft and had AOT baked in. They spent so much time not wanting to pay Mono&#x27;s license but later it was all moot and not needed fully. Since that time Unity has been a constantly changing beast, and not for the better, painful wholesale updates with little or no benefit, only to see that system disappear soon and on to the next.<p>Unity needs to calm down, lock down API signatures&#x2F;facades, focus on atomic operations, make simple APIs as abstractions and change the underlying systems when it evolves. They do parallel changes which is good, but the surface changes quite a bit.  Unity has become one big leaky abstraction. I have used it almost everyday since 2008 and it would be fine if they made things more simple, but even the transition is painful.  Like when they removed their legacy particle system (which had a decent API) and one day just pulled it from a new build, every old game just crashed on open, no warning.  They are getting better at that but it should not be like that.<p>I am in the middle of a bunch of NGUI to UnityUI upgrades and that is already going to be replaced with UIComponents ... UI constructs (types, textures, fonts) really don&#x27;t change that much and they spent years on that UI update. Why are users having to concern themselves with surface changes?<p>A major difference between Unity and Unreal is Unity doesn&#x27;t build games on their engine, Unreal does.  While that sometimes makes Unreal solutions more FPS&#x2F;BR format and closer to their games, it makes for a solid engine.<p>Another difference is leadership, Unity was extremely simple and small before, once they got John Riccitiello it become a management&#x2F;business focused company over engineering leaders in terms of power and direction.<p>Unreal has Tim Sweeney, and old school guy that understands how to make a game engine and has done it over and over. They learned alot from Unity, and are now doing it better than them once they turned towards simplicity over complexity.<p>When Unreal 4 swapped out UnrealScript for C++ it went into overdrive in terms of performance and clean. Unity is nice that it is C# as well, but the extra weight of constant changing systems that seem half done and not code first is tiresome.<p>I love Unity, I make a large part of my living from it, I hate to see them not understand that breaking changes constantly, gets a bit old and it essentially offloads technical debt to every user of the system. I am using Unreal more because of some of these issues.<p>People use a market engine to offload the engine team. That engine team should do whatever it takes to make transitions easy, and when difficult there needs to be immense benefits. Some of those are questionable in recent years. The desire for Unity to want to be Unreal is losing the mobile side and web is essentially not even a focus anymore which is more the whole market not Unity&#x27;s fault. Unity started really as a better Flash, now they want to be Unreal. Right now Unreal is winning that and the Unreal 4 rewrite with C++ backed is really clean. Unity still more simple but with the new DOTS&#x2F;Rendering Pipelines it is not.<p>Unity, let the engineers&#x2F;product people lead over the managers, you are losing a good thing.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=oDQl9gw_fRM\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=oDQl9gw_fRM<\/a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogs.unity3d.com&#x2F;2010&#x2F;07&#x2F;02&#x2F;unity-and-ios-4-0-update-iii&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogs.unity3d.com&#x2F;2010&#x2F;07&#x2F;02&#x2F;unity-and-ios-4-0-updat...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-22 16:52:56"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["pjmlp"],"id":[23272779],"kids":[23272807,23272825,23275297],"parent":[23271973],"text":["Looking at its adoption by Hollywood and TV channels for 3D based animations, Unity is getting lots of stuff right.<p>I guess there is always Godot for those that don&#x27;t feel the same way."],"time":["2020-05-22 16:56:51"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["randtrain34"],"id":[23273877],"kids":{},"parent":[23271973],"text":["Godot Engine <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;godotengine.org&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;godotengine.org&#x2F;<\/a> is much more user-friendly in my experience."],"time":["2020-05-22 18:31:40"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["avilay"],"id":[23277376],"kids":[23277786],"parent":[23271973],"text":["What do folks here think of Panda3D (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.panda3d.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.panda3d.org<\/a>)?<p>Its just a game engine without any IDE.

When you do a concert you don&#x27;t just have to pay for the composition and arrangement and such, you also have to pay for the secondary exploitation rights (i.e. the performing musicians), and if someone sings, you also have to satisfy the collecting society responsible for the lyrics.

I’ve sent a note asking my district representative to support reform, and would encourage everyone to do the same:<p>&gt; In Green v. AOL (2003), the court established:<p>&gt; There is no real dispute that Green&#x27;s fundamental tort claim is that AOL was negligent in promulgating harmful content and in failing to address certain harmful content on its network. Green thus attempts to hold AOL liable for decisions relating to the monitoring, screening, and deletion of content from its network — actions quintessentially related to a publisher&#x27;s role. Section 230 &quot;specifically proscribes liability&quot; in such circumstances. Zeran, 129 F.3d at 332-33.<p>&gt; There is immediately a question why this &quot;quintessential relation&quot; only works in one direction, i.e. why even when &quot;monitoring, screening, and [deleting content]&quot;, a provider should not be considered a publisher, and thus ineligible for immunity under Section 230. The courts may not agree with that argument, but I would say that it highlights a serious deficiency, and the law needs to be changed in a similar manner as Josh Hawley&#x27;s bill: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.congress.gov&#x2F;bill&#x2F;116th-congress&#x2F;senate-bill&#x2F;1914\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.congress.gov&#x2F;bill&#x2F;116th-congress&#x2F;senate-bill&#x2F;191...<\/a><p>&gt; In fact I would argue that his bill does not go far enough. Getting an FTC rubber-stamp certifying &quot;no political bias&quot; seems like a vague and squishy system that will be easy to game. Perhaps the law should state that any provider above a certain size which takes action to &quot;monitor, screen, or delete content&quot; that is not illegal, and does not respond to an appropriate claim by reversing this decision, should forfeit immunity under Section 230. This would be very controversial, because it effectively bans e.g. YouTube from having their own &quot;code of conduct&quot; independent of US law. But I think that is exactly what needs to happen - YouTube is far too big for a &quot;community standard&quot; to make sense, and any attempt to do this will be abused for censorship. These companies should be forced to engage with all of us in the making of laws about free speech, they should not effectively be able to declare what free speech is by fiat."],"time":["2020-05-22 23:23:07"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ken"],"id":[23277330],"kids":[23279108,23277973],"parent":[23274094],"text":["This happened to a friend of mine recently, who didn&#x27;t care to fight it, so we all lost.<p>The part that I don&#x27;t understand is: Shazam is really bad at classical music.

Just glass, but at that angle that just reflects and doesn&#x27;t let you see in. Faux-invitational, Terry called it. The front door was frosted glass. It was that special kind that would be clear when you put a voltage to it. The giant windows directly next to the door were like that too. Or so Terry heard. He&#x27;d never seen them frosted all at once. Some would be, some wouldn&#x27;t. Faulty wiring, he guessed.<p>Terry stood in line to get into PrezsHub. There was always a line. They got rid of the badge scanners, too unsanitary. His turn. He waited as some scanner somewhere read his face. At first Terry had smiled every time he stood in front of the door. The massive door of plate glass on tiny little hinges with a tiny little motor to swing the thing. The smiling stopped soon enough though. Terry had thought his boss actually cared to see the smile, or that maybe someone did. Nope. The scanner took it&#x27;s time, you never could tell how long it would take. Terry shifted his face this way and that. Finally, the door defrosted and tried to open. Slowly, inch by inch, all the way open. Terry ducked inside long before it had taken the full three minute twenty-two seconds to complete a cycle of opening, pausing, and then closing and refrosting.<p>After passing by the Wellness-Entrepreneur-And-Sanctuary-Expert team&#x27;s front desk, the cavern opened up. PrezsHub was ultra cutting edge. The CEO was one of those unicorn people that really believed he wasn&#x27;t going to die. He had escaped taxes, so why not death too? So, slowly at first, he had gotten rid of almost everything at PrezsHub.<p>First it was the cubes. That move was nice at first, a bit more air. Long tables sure. Then the noise, the chattering, the gossip, the microwaved fish. Ghastly. After covid21 subsided, everyone came back to the office to find, well, nothing.<p>The CEO had ripped up the floor, put in charging ports and wifi, and then covered the whole thing in hardwood. No desks, no chairs, nothing. Even the toilets had been replaced with Japanese ones, bidet and all. The walls slowly sloped up to the roof too, it made a great half pipe, but there was nowhere to put a back against. The whole company was now &#x27;floor gang&#x27;. The CEO said it was great for your body, just you and the hardwood. He sat there for three hours in a yoga position that first day back. By the end of the week, he was working from home for a bit. He almost never came in anymore.<p>Terry&#x27;s butt had gone numb before the first 15 minutes had gone by. Everyone&#x27;s had. People started bringing in camping chairs and card table desks. Then one day the Wellness-Entrepreneur-And-Sanctuary-Expert-Team said no more camping chairs. The CEO was concerned about them scrumming up the hardwood floors they had paid for. People started to bring in cushions and even more low budget camping equipment. Again, the Wellness-Entrepreneur-And-Sanctuary-Expert-Team stopped people after getting past the door. Those were creating dust and some were staining the flooring. The CEO was &#x27;wigged out&#x27; about it. As his video address echoed off the walls of the empty building, he said everyone needed to be health conscious and just sit. So for the rest of the week, thats all Terry and the rest of PrezsHub did, they just sat. The CEO was adamant that no work be done, so that the chakras could align with Mars or something. Of course, half the company got put on a PIP for failing to meet deadlines.<p>So Terry went to find a working outlet on the floor and sat down with his bag and personal laptop, a perk. He plugged in, saw that it wasn&#x27;t working and had to go get up and hunt around the room for a working outlet. Like at the airport, but more cliquey. He found a group, the Support And Development team; they weren&#x27;t too Slack-y. He could get those tickets closed, maybe. He put on his carpal tunnel splints, opened his laptop, changed his password in the system yet again, hunched over, and got to work.<p>Terry&#x27;s back hurt."],"time":["2020-05-23 19:46:10"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["SlipperySlope"],"id":[23274664],"kids":[23276020,23279043],"parent":[23273758],"text":["Need private offices with UV-C lamps sterilizing the air going into each office.<p>Less sick days will pay for the private office floor space, plus productivity increases."],"time":["2020-05-22 19:30:33"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mmsimanga"],"id":[23271242],"kids":[23278089],"parent":[23270581],"text":["Interesting the author mentions he is inspired by MVP.css[0].

Building new solar would routinely be cheaper than operating already built fossil fuel plants, even in the world of ultra-cheap natural gas we live in now. This is what I’ve called the third phase of clean energy, where building new clean energy is cheaper than keeping fossil fuel plants running. Even in places like Northern Europe, by the later 2030s we’d see solar costs below the operating cost of fossil fuels, providing cheap electricity in summer months with their very long days in the high latitudes.

After years of waiting for jobs to communicate other then relying on file artifacts this is somewhat disappointing.<p>I would like to see parent&#x2F;child pipelines recive some love as currently it does work but quirks are all around. For example, its not easy (or sometimes even possible) to pass pipeline variables from parent to child, pipline UI behaves differently when being part of relation (and many times unusuable or shows a wrong thing), not being able to repeat manual jobs with the same var initially passed, not even being able to run it again with any other var unless you delete all previous executions, strange limitations on masked secret vars, $ in your password will get evaluated as variable etc ...<p>Seems like an afterthought, rather then a carefully designed feature set.

It makes it very easy to extend your type if needed.

Evaluating whiteboards for a 60-year-old and two 5-year-olds to use together with video chat was.... not super fun.<p>What we&#x27;ve settled on:<p>We do the video chat on an old fullscreen iMac we had lying around. My mom and each kid all have their own iPads. For the first couple of weeks we used a webwhiteboard, but the littles were having a LOT of trouble with it. It&#x27;s not optimized for iPads. It&#x27;s easy to click on links in the nav. Different size screens see different regions of the whiteboard. My niece and son kept clearing each other&#x27;s work and causing fights.<p>I ended up building a little prototype for them with rails&#x2F;websockets that tried to solve all the dumb stuff that makes it hard to use it on iPads. Apple really doesn&#x27;t make it easy, though. You can bookmark a page to your homescreen to get rid of the Safari chrome (URL bar is the worst for 5yos), but then you can&#x27;t have cookies and regular usage (maybe just while fullscreen?) will prompt you that the webpage is trying to steal your passwords (fake keyboard warning). Guided access gets rid of most of the obnoxious gestures they were triggering by accident. I disabled most of the multi-touch events in javascript.<p>I fixed the board size with selectable orientation (portrait&#x2F;landscape) and set it to scale + aspect-fits to everyone&#x27;s device. I added a simple host&#x2F;guest permission model so my mom has a few teacher permissions that the kids don&#x27;t have. She can either be in teacher mode (she can draw&#x2F;clear, they can&#x27;t), class mode (anyone can draw&#x2F;clear), or student mode where each kid gets their own private board that she can swap between (she can still draw&#x2F;clear on student boards).<p>I was starting to work on more teaching features -- the ability for her to save&#x2F;load sketches so she could do lesson plans ahead of time, the ability for her to &quot;broadcast&quot; saved boards to the student boards so she could make assignments for each 5yo to fill out.

Even in their use in integration they were kind of a mystery to me, if I recall correctly we just defined integration on subset of R^n, where differential forms played the same role as d_{x_1}d_{x_2}...d_{x_n}, which is known from the riemann integral, but then to define integration on manifolds, we just used the pullback of the charts, which didn&#x27;t alleviate any of the mystery and didn&#x27;t add anything about why differential forms themselves are supposed to be important. I wish I had taken some physics courses, where vector calculus is used heavily and that might have helped some, but in the end I was somewhat disappointed, because even though taking the course certainly did make me a better mathematician, I still didn&#x27;t have the feeling of really completely grasping the concepts, even though I could prove statements."],"time":["2020-05-22 13:31:26"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["bmitc"],"id":[23270163],"kids":[23270988,23270331],"parent":[23269351],"text":["For anyone wanting to learn more about this, I highly recommend <i>Advanced Calculus: A Differential Forms Approach<\/i> by Harold Edwards and <i>An Introduction to Manifolds<\/i> by Loring Tu.

I haven&#x27;t read the full thing yet, but any talk of displays is EXTREMELY premature.  This isn&#x27;t even <i>one pixel<\/i>- it&#x27;s steerable in only one direction.  In order to steer in two directions, you&#x27;d need to stack up hundreds of these.  That would give you a pixel... one that&#x27;s at least a millimeter wide, or 10x wider than a color block on the screen I&#x27;m typing this into.  Certainly it would be incredibly expensive to make an entire display out of this.<p>It&#x27;s even pretty premature for lidar- for safety reasons lidar is in the infrared, usually around 1 micron wavelength, which makes a big difference in terms of manufacturability and price.  One of the biggest problems for solid state lidar is the beamwidth, which can be a couple degrees or even &gt;10 degrees in some cases.  This is .17 degrees, which is a fantastic result, but still quite large compared to conventional lidar.  Top end lidar has angular resolution below .1 degrees and you can integrate data over time to find edges as sharp as the beamspot, which can give you some really insane precision.  If we used this system, the intense blur over the spot would require deconvolution and strongly limit precision.<p>Back of the envelope math: at .75 m (2.5&#x27;), .17 degrees between pixels would give you ~2.25 mm pixel pitch.  Even at that distance, the blurring will be intense- the middle picture here[1] is semi-accurate. Obviously fidelity wasn&#x27;t the goal and this doesn&#x27;t represent the limits of the technology!  Don&#x27;t give up hope.  Just expect to see someone demonstrate something that exceeds the requirement for fidelity before it actually gets made into a consumer product.<p>This paper has similar results to an MIT paper[2], but with 3x higher wavelength.  Naturally, 3x higher wavelength way more than 3x harder.  This device is also smaller- the MIT device is ~1 mm by .1 mm vs. ~1 mm by ~10 nm.  That&#x27;s mostly due to the fact that the MIT device can steer in two directions- the first direction works with phase shifters just like this device, but the second direction works by heating up the emitters so that they change size (genius).<p>The device here basically just pipes laser light out through the side of the wafer, which syncs up excellently with the MIT approach.  MIT used very long (500 micron) antennas that have a thin-thick-thin wavy pattern[3]; at each wide part (IIRC) refraction causes light to escape at a particular angle.  Changing the length of the wide parts changes the resonance of the light inside and therefor the angle light escapes at, and that&#x27;s how they did beamforming.  Normally this would require atomically-perfect manufacturing, but the long antenna averages errors out (although you still end up with just under 1 degree of beamwidth).  With a suitable intermediate layer you might be able to plug this work into the MIT antennas and get full steering without needing to stack arrays.<p>This is all way better than current commercial solid state lidars, which mostly use rectangular patch antennas to project lasers.  The optical properties of those systems are really bad.  It&#x27;s a shame there isn&#x27;t more money in research like this, because it&#x27;s necessary to make that final jump.<p>[1]: \n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Gaussian_blur#&#x2F;media&#x2F;File:Cappadocia_Gaussian_Blur.svg\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Gaussian_blur#&#x2F;media&#x2F;File:Capp...<\/a><p>[2]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.researchgate.net&#x2F;publication&#x2F;320235900_Coherent_solid-state_LIDAR_with_silicon_photonic_optical_phased_arrays\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.researchgate.net&#x2F;publication&#x2F;320235900_Coherent_...<\/a><p>[3]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;spectrum.ieee.org&#x2F;image&#x2F;Mjc5NjU5MA.jpeg\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;spectrum.ieee.org&#x2F;image&#x2F;Mjc5NjU5MA.jpeg<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-23 02:01:27"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ISL"],"id":[23277607],"kids":{},"parent":[23276789],"text":["Very cool.<p>OSA press-release here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.osa.org&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;about_osa&#x2F;newsroom&#x2F;news_releases&#x2F;2020&#x2F;chip-based_device_opens_new_doors_for_augmented_re&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.osa.org&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;about_osa&#x2F;newsroom&#x2F;news_releases&#x2F;2...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-23 00:06:00"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mysterEFrank"],"id":[23277761],"kids":{},"parent":[23276789],"text":["Awesome, this could enable cheap high-resolution 3D displays"],"time":["2020-05-23 00:24:55"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["cryptonector"],"id":[23277866],"kids":{},"parent":[23276789],"text":["Solid state LIDAR?"],"time":["2020-05-23 00:37:16"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["madengr"],"id":[23278505],"kids":[23279781],"parent":[23276789],"text":["With an aperiodic spacing, I wonder how high the grating lobes are?

We have a freemium browser extension that acts as a grammar checker. Couple thoughts below:<p>1. Source code. You are allowed to minify source code. Chrome actually recommends minifying source to improve performance. If you require certain permissions you&#x27;ll have to submit un-minified source for security review.<p>2.  Cloud&#x2F;subscription based models are the way to go if piracy is an issue, but it doesn&#x27;t make sense for all products. Licensing hasn&#x27;t been an issue for Sapling fortunately because the &quot;brains&quot; of our app are in the cloud. I know hacker news is very privacy conscious but our language models are too large to run on a user&#x27;s end machine right now. Spier Pro seems like a useful web-scraping helper. People who can pirate a chrome extension probably can probably run xpath scripts or a free xpath testing extension themselves so if I were Amy I wouldn&#x27;t worry _too_ much about piracy.<p>3. Forked Code. There should be no reason to do it. Firefox and Edge have done a lot of work to support most of the chrome apis. You can handle minor edge cases build time with a variable toggle. Keep the same manifest, even. Browsers are good about ignoring keywords in the manifest they don&#x27;t recognize. My recommendation is to pretend they are the same platform until you find bugs&#x2F;issues and hard code around them.

Look at the recent build of Super Mario 64 for the PC. The game went from being able to run on a handful of systems (13.56 million Wii U&#x27;s, 101.63 million Wii&#x27;s, 32.93 million N64&#x27;s) to nearly every modern x86-based computer.

Novice or careless implementations lead to accounts that tweet at the same time or based on the same trigger words. Tweets made on a routine basis are the easiest to detect (e.g. Tweets at 5PM CST every day)<p>But things go much deeper. There are even companies that now develop bots tools essentially, increasing the randomness or human-like qualities of bots. These are much harder to detect with the standard methods.<p>There are other proxies, like not getting organic replies or having no friends. But the sophisticated bot networks have already figured this out. You have to realize that sometimes human labor even goes into the effort, where someone will maintain hundreds of fake accounts, and attempt to make them look organic.<p>From these points, it&#x27;s easy to underestimate the number of actual bot accounts.<p>On the other hand, these same methods don&#x27;t usually control well for a certain type of Twitter user. There are actually some really obsessive twitter users who will spend 12+ hours a day active. They typically produce a ton of content, and a lot of replies. I notice this on celebrity&#x2F;political accounts especially. (Apparently people are calling this the &#x27;reply-guy&#x27; now)<p>Those accounts are susceptible to appearing as bots because they deviate far from what one might imagine the &#x27;average&#x27; Twitter user looks like. Speaking anecdotally, I think this relates closest to politics, and hot topic issues (Hence the topic in this research). Take a Tweet from the US President for example. You will notice the same few dozen accounts reply to <i>every<\/i> Tweet of his. Some may be bots, but others are most definitely human.<p>But these often get classified as bots.<p>If I had to make a guess, I would say the bot detection models fail more often to account for the true number of bots.<p>At this point, it&#x27;s an arms race. Obvious bots are becoming increasingly less obvious. Overall, I think bots are only going to get better, and it worries me for the fate of social networks. The thing most frightening is finding an obvious bot and seeing a large number of organic users interacting with it as if it were real.<p>Edit: One more thing I forgot to mention. An increasing number of bots are getting verified now. I have no idea how the verification process works, but apparently the botters have figured out how to game it successfully."],"time":["2020-05-22 06:57:43"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["newyankee"],"id":[23269360],"kids":{},"parent":[23268521],"text":["Although not a fan of exposing real identity on social media i wonder if there is a mechanism where twitter can acknowledge that an account is real based on some behind the scenes Zk-snark like validation."],"time":["2020-05-22 08:57:51"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[23268865],"kids":{},"parent":[23268521],"text":{},"time":["2020-05-22 07:17:30"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":["tiagobraw"],"id":[23269489],"kids":[23269612],"parent":[23268521],"text":["why don&#x27;t Twitter require a capcha before tweeting? it would reduce the number of bots by a large factor...<p>it could also have a way for legitimate bots to be registered and easily identified as such"],"time":["2020-05-22 09:22:38"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[23270600],"kids":{},"parent":[23268521],"text":{},"time":["2020-05-22 12:37:36"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":["dannyeei"],"id":[23269178],"kids":{},"parent":[23268521],"text":["You cut out the rest of the title! &quot;...

We have applications running on both PostgreSQL and MongoDB and I find that working with MongoDB is just more pleasant. I think it mostly boils down to my preference of document databases as opposed to relational ones. It feels much more natural to me to embed &#x2F; nest certain properties within a document instead of spreading it across several tables and then joining everything together to get the complete data. MongoDB makes working with these sometimes nested documents easy (I mean, it better) and there&#x27;s always Aggregation Pipeline when you need it (something that I again find much more pleasant and readable over SQL).<p>What always irks me is when somebody suggests PostgreSQL&#x27;s json (or jsonb) types as an alternative to using MongoDB. All it&#x27;s saying is that the person hasn&#x27;t really invested a lot of time into MongoDB because there are things that PostgreSQL simply cannot do over a json type, especially when it comes to data updates. Or it <i>can<\/i> do that but the query is just overly complicated and often includes sub queries just to get the indexes into the arrays you want to update. All of that is simple in MongoDB, not really a surprise - that&#x27;s exactly what it was made for. The last time I worked with PostreSQL&#x27;s json I sometimes ended up just pulling the value out of the column entirely, modified it in memory and set the it back to the db because that was either way easier or the only way to do the operation I wanted (needless to say there are only exceptional cases where you can do that safely).<p>Lastly, if you can easily replace MongoDB with PostgreSQL and its json types or you&#x27;re missing joins a lot (MongoDB <i>does<\/i> have left join but it&#x27;s rarely needed), chances are you haven&#x27;t really designed your data in a &quot;document&quot; oriented way and there&#x27;s <i>no<\/i> reason to use MongoDB in that case."],"time":["2020-05-22 13:49:29"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["StavrosK"],"id":[23270723],"kids":[23271005],"parent":[23270429],"text":["No, I had a sour experience in 2009 where it ate my data, the devs were rather cavalier with &quot;there&#x27;s a warning on the download page&quot; (I got it through apt), it ate my data again when the OOM killer killed its process.<p>I didn&#x27;t like the project attitude of a database being so lax with persistence, so I never used it again."],"time":["2020-05-22 12:59:17"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["niffydroid"],"id":[23270886],"kids":[23270931],"parent":[23270429],"text":["Yes, it&#x27;s our main DB.

Almost everything moved to PG. The abstract issue we had with mongo is the purported &#x27;best practices&#x27; with using it were seemingly in conflict with its actual implementation. I should note that these are issues across the last ~5 years so it&#x27;s likely some of this has changed, it&#x27;s also likely my recollection of the details are not perfect.<p>Mongo pushes the idea of keeping related data in a single document. So if you have a hierarchy of data, keep in all in a nested document under a &#x27;parent&#x27; concept, say an &#x27;Account&#x27;. The problem with this is that there is a document limit of 16MB and key overhead is high. At one point we had to write a sharding strategy where by data would be sharded across multiple documents due to this limit. This also broke atomic updates so we had to code around that. We also ran into a problem where for some update patterns, mongo would read the entire document, modify it, then flush the entire document back to disk. For large documents, this became extremely slow. At one point this required an emergency migration of a database to TokuMX which has a fast update optimization that avoids this read-modify-write pattern in many cases, as I recall it was something like 25x faster in our particular situation. This same issue caused massive operations issues any time mongo failed over as the ram state of the secondary isn&#x27;t kept up to date with the master so updates to large docs would result in massive latency spikes until the secondary could get it&#x27;s ram state in order. In general we just found that mongo&#x27;s recommended pattern of usage just didn&#x27;t scale well at all, which is in contrast to its marketing pitch.<p>I think at one point we had something around 6TB of data spread across 3 mongo clusters. After migrating most of that to PG or other stores and reworking various processes that could now use SQL transactions and views, the data size is a small fraction of what it was in mongo and everything is substantially faster. In one extreme example there was a process that synced data to an external store as the result certain updates. Because we couldn&#x27;t use single documents and had no cross document update guarantees we would have to walk almost the entire dataset for this update to guarantee consistency. It got to the point that this process took over 24 hours and we would schedule these update to run over a weekend as a result. With the data moved PG, that same process is now implemented as a materialized view that takes ~20 seconds to build and we sync every 15 minutes just to be sure. Granted this improvement isn&#x27;t just a database change but rather an architectural change, however mongo&#x27;s lack of multi-doc transactions and document size limit are what drove the architectural design in the first place.<p>Then there are bugs, of which there were many, but the worst of which was a situation where updates claimed to succeed, but actually just dropped the data on the floor. I found a matching issue in mongo&#x27;s bug tracker that had been open for years at that point. Ultimately I just can&#x27;t trust a datastore that has open data loss bugs for years, regardless of its current state."],"time":["2020-05-22 17:20:15"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["collyw"],"id":[23273697],"kids":{},"parent":[23270429],"text":["Sadly my work is on Mongo."],"time":["2020-05-22 18:17:53"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["RyanGoosling"],"id":[23275436],"kids":{},"parent":[23270429],"text":["MongoDB is for devs who don&#x27;t respect data"],"time":["2020-05-22 20:40:15"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["pjmlp"],"id":[23271018],"kids":{},"parent":[23270429],"text":["I never used it and don&#x27;t plan to."],"time":["2020-05-22 13:40:18"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["lcfcjs2"],"id":[23273116],"kids":{},"parent":[23270429],"text":["I love MongoDB, but recently I have been favoring CouchDB for my projects, its a quick and easy setup."],"time":["2020-05-22 17:26:17"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["fag_rape"],"id":[23277638],"kids":{},"parent":[23270429],"text":["JavaScript is shitty, and JSON is even shittier.

You have to specify more which you assumed was common knowledge. Also things like meeting hours are somewhat more flexible in other places than in N&#x2F;W Europe.<p>Timezones: many things have been said about it but it didn&#x27;t work for most companies combining Europe with (South)-East Asia. Ukraine and Russia was not a problem.<p>Management capability: a managerial job locally is not the same remotely and most could not adapt or required more people offsetting the cost savings. This tended to count more for smaller businesses.<p>Emotional: lack of affinity with the product, remote workers are counting just hours spend and thus the TCO was ignoring the hours local people spend in their own time working on the product. This is not a given for all but was one of the reasons companies switched back.<p>These are just some examples. Most companies, especially the smaller ones, switched back to local hiring. Some made it work but not at the expected savings. The most successfull were the bigger businesses and my guess would be they had&#x2F;took a longer time to prepare and hired the correct people for the job instead of relying on already hired employees which is not something you can always do in smaller businesses due to continuity.<p>I really wonder what is going to be the effect this time as everybody is forced at least to train all the soft skills like remote communication and scheduling."],"time":["2020-05-22 09:26:32"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["lifeisstillgood"],"id":[23269233],"kids":{},"parent":[23268581],"text":["You know people keep talking about how to &quot;recreate Silicon Valley at location X&quot; - here is an idea for making your small country &#x2F; tourist hotspot way less reliant on tourism<p>- implement world beating virus testing and tracking\n- invest so heavily in child care and education it makes your head swim\n- build out offices for rent and look at your building codes<p>Now start saying you are a remote work friendly area.<p>My wife and I choose to sit in London&#x27;s metro area for one main reason - kids schools.

It&#x27;s just not going to happen en masse. I&#x27;m sure some companies will try it and learn the same lessons others have previously about engaging in this behaviour.<p>It would also be political suicide, if not worse, if world leaders saw their companies trying to move locally held jobs outside their borders and did not drop the hammer on the companies involved. We&#x27;re already in a time of mass unemployment, in which:<p>- many were already heralding the death of globalism<p>- we&#x27;ve learned very dear lessons about outsourcing the supply chain<p>- people are become so much more aware of the risen inequality that even formerly hardline capitalist media are running headlines about the billionaires profiting massively off the pandemic while millions register for unemployment checks<p>So if the leaders want to prevent large scale social unrest, a gun which I believe we&#x27;re already looking down the barrel of, then they would be wise to keep a very close eye on the movements carried out by companies within their governance.<p>That said, I do foresee some significant, lasting consequences should there be a mass shift to working from home or even a 4 days at home &#x2F; 1 day in the office situation:<p>- Today&#x27;s cities face a real threat of ending up as Detroit did.<p>-- People will flee for better pastures immediately. Why live in a shoebox in the sky when your money gets you far better elsewhere?<p>-- Commercial real estate, and nearby residential real estate, has the potential to collapse and rapidly so. If I were living in Toronto, working for Shopify and owned a condo now I would likely be putting it on the market ASAP.<p>-- Taxes, be it through indirect sales taxes or VAT, land transfer taxes, property taxes, etc. would crater leaving a massive hole in public funding through which no reasonable measure will fill.<p>-- Public transit fare revenue will evaporate.<p>-- Small businesses, restaurants, retail etc. will be wiped out with the lack of casual foot traffic<p>When the above potentially happens, those who wanted to live in a city for the benefits of living in a city would also likely flee.<p>- A permanent, wide scale loss of jobs in retail, food &amp; beverage, etc.<p>You could argue that those jobs will be replaced by new demands for new supply in the new areas previous city dwellers move to, but if everyone is WFH I would imagine they won&#x27;t be frequenting such stores in anywhere near the volume that was provided previously.<p>Given the above I believe it&#x27;s pretty self-centered and reckless of large companies to be making such announcements as Shopify, Facebook et al. have made at a time where cities and countries are merely trying to ward off a pandemic and are already facing an employment and budget crisis as a result of it. They&#x27;re essentially doing one of the most damaging, potentially impactful things they could be by doing so right now.<p>These announcements, for me personally and despite my previous hopes of seeing more remote opportunities become available over time, are only furthering my cynicism toward this industry in general at this point."],"time":["2020-05-22 10:17:25"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["buzzkillington"],"id":[23269040],"kids":{},"parent":[23268581],"text":["Sounds like the writer is scared that their bullshit job is on the line.<p>People have tried outsourcing programming forever.
