The qualifier &quot;strictly&quot; is important, because without it you get kind of the opposite of what the article is actually saying, which is more along the lines of this quote: &quot;<i>You’re going to still see your doctor, but now you’ll be adjunctively cared for virtually as well<\/i>&quot;<p>It&#x27;s a subtle distinction, but it&#x27;s consistently surprising how small nuances in titles produce widely divergent discussions.

Ask any economist why deflation is a bad thing and they will generally tell you that it is because they want to avoid a deflationary spiral with collapsing prices and high unemployment, which is why they want to ensure that consumers mindlessly consume and ensure that prices are kept &quot;stable&quot; (in their opinion, stable prices mean a positive inflation rate of 2%, which in my humble opinion does not make sense in pure mathematical terms).<p>However, there are two fundamental and overlooked errors in the assumptions that underlie this theory:<p>a) there is an assumption that consumers&#x2F;agents are homogenous in their preferences and that people would rather starve to death than give up the opportunity to spend their money when it is worth more in the future. No sane person is going to wait one year to wait out some insignificant appreciation in the value of the money. People will still need to consume food and many of them would prefer to buy things now than in the future (consumer time preference, i.e. the desire to want things now rather than later, is <i>always<\/i> positive). For some inexplicable reason, time preference is completely ignored in the foundations of the theories that underpin modern monetary policy.<p>b) the second main assumption is that money saved is money that is unproductive. This is false: savings lead to investment in the economy as resources that would otherwise be consumed are redirected into lengthening production structures in the economy. Put simply, this means that if more people put money in the bank, the bank will have more money to lend out and interest rates would fall, allowing entrepreneurs and companies to invest in production structures which in the long-run will lead to higher quality goods and cheaper prices.<p>Of course, in the current highly distorted economy, deflation is disastrous as companies which are addicted to debt will need to be liquidated as there is no longer a steady stream of money coming in through inflation. This will likely lead to a severe recession, but this is not a bad thing as in the long-run the economy is better off as inefficient businesses who are addicted to debt and cheap money will no longer be able to operate, and clever entrepreneurs will be able to take their place.<p>It is savings that build up capital structures in the economy, not consumption which largely distorts and even destroys said structures, and the faster we stop this destructive inflationary monetary policy the faster we return to sustainable, fair, and <i>real<\/i> economic growth."],"time":["2020-05-24 10:23:36"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jacob9706"],"id":[23293772],"kids":{},"parent":[23289042],"text":["&quot;Average people are saving enough for an emergency.&quot; Am I missing something here?"],"time":["2020-05-24 21:02:56"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["digitaltrees"],"id":[23294585],"kids":{},"parent":[23289042],"text":["On balance this is a good thing but any trend taken too far is a problem.<p>That being said the time to safe is when the economy is good not in the heart of a crisis.

Everyone hates Jerks so why does a Jerk even exist at all? Everything a Jerk does will lower his individual chances of survival by making people hate them. Humans are social creatures and an anti-social person likely will not survive if the group hates them.<p>Group dynamics of humans will ultimately select out Jerks. That is unless the Jerk has something to offer beyond making everyone hate them.<p>Obviously Jerks exist in our world, so their continued existence must offer something beneficial to the group. What would that be?<p>So imagine this situation. There&#x27;s a software engineer at a company who&#x27;s well liked. He&#x27;s super nice, friendly, good-looking BUT he&#x27;s ultimately not a very good software engineer.  His skills are well below average, his boss knows it, everyone who&#x27;s worked with him knows it, the only people who don&#x27;t seem to know it is he himself and people who haven&#x27;t directly worked with him. His skills are so poor that he would be fired if he wasn&#x27;t so well liked.<p>Therein lies the problem. His Boss likes him but is unable to be honest with him about how his skills are so horrible that he&#x27;ll be fired if everyone knows about how shitty his skills are. The person is so nice and well liked that not only is his career getting protected but his feelings are being protected as well because nobody wants to be a Jerk and hurt those feelings by telling him the reality.<p>Then a real Jerk of a person is suddenly assigned to work with this nice guy. The Jerk immediately sees the problem and reveals the truth to everyone. The Jerk regularly says things along the lines of: &quot;This guy is useless, he doesn&#x27;t know shit, the guy can&#x27;t even code properly. His code is complete garbage.&quot; The Jerk publicly says these things and reveals to everyone the reality of the situation.<p>These are very toxic words that introduce aggression into the workplace.<p>But the Jerk introduces truth into the workplace. The Jerk was the only person who tells things like it is at face value. If the Jerk wasn&#x27;t there, the well liked person would continue to be in that role and function as a parasite with the person himself and most of the company oblivious to the reality of the situation.<p>The cost of empathy is a mask placed over reality.<p>If your organization doesn&#x27;t have Jerks then I almost guarantee that there is very likely to be huge issues within the organization that are masked by etiquette. The Jerk is essentially telling the truth and revealing big issues at great cost to himself. It&#x27;s almost a form of self sacrifice.<p>In my my mind the Jerk exists because he benefits the group, but his actions come at great cost to his individual survival because Jerks aren&#x27;t well liked.<p>Additionally I would argue that the term &quot;Jerk&quot; is a misnomer. Someone who is explicit about the truth should not be called a Jerk, especially when the truth comes at such a high cost.<p>The real Jerk is someone who deliberately covers up the truth. A manipulative person is never called a Jerk. A company without a single Jerk, a company where people have nearly perfect etiquette and friendly communication is also a company with a high number of manipulative people and likely deep problems that aren&#x27;t discussed.<p>I don&#x27;t know about you, but I&#x27;d rather deal with an oblivious Jerk than a well liked manipulator."],"time":["2020-05-24 19:08:35"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["blfr"],"id":[23292261],"kids":[23292422,23292429,23294005],"parent":[23291427],"text":["We have seen decades of general stagnation compared to decades of new inventions and growth before that.

A majority of the issues stem from horribly strict enforcement of policies. What these sites expect from us mere mortals is to do a tightrope walk every time we create and launch something. And some of these policies are actually ridiculous. I understand the fallout of Cambridge Analytica has caused all these sites to give more importance to policy enforcement but the solution to that problem does not lie in automating it through use of technology alone. Business and people&#x27;s livelihood depend on these policy enforcement. God forbid your business Ad account is shutdown for good because you used a word that causes some stupid algorithm somewhere trigger an automatic ban.<p>It has happened to me. And worst part is you have no recourse. I have spoken directly with Google Execs who were assigned to a client of mine for managing a big ad account. Even they were clueless as to why the system suspended the account. After a lot of digging around I realized that it was because I had used the same credit card in two different accounts. I mean really? Come on! I am lucky I had a Google Exec who was in contact with me because the client was high value. What would small businesses be going through if the same thing happened to them? I shudder to think.<p>All these sites need to relax with their enforcement of policies. Deploy humans for this.

I had created a &quot;brand account&quot; to use with YouTube, and for some reason the new account was flagged for suspension within the first day. I was annoyed, but it didn&#x27;t bother me too much, and I submitted my appeal (aside: I always feel wonderful having no clue what I&#x27;m appealing - I&#x27;m pretty sure even the Soviet Union or Nazi Germany would have given me the dignity of knowing what I&#x27;d been convicted of before the trial + execution&#x2F;Gulag). Two days later, I woke up to two emails from Google: the first indicating that my main Google account - the one where I have my email, several domain names and YouTube TV - had been suspended; the second indicating that the team reviewed my appeal and had found I hadn&#x27;t violated any policies and my account had been reinstated, but that I&#x27;d need to login soon. I logged in posthaste and found that my brand account was still disabled, but at least I could read and backup my email. (At the time I also happened to be in salary negotiations with my then-client and now employer. Really wonderful timing.)<p>I tried to submit another appeal on the brand account suspension, explaining that I&#x27;d received a reinstatement email referencing the original ticket number, and that all their team had done was erroneously disable and reenable my main account. This time, I got a response saying that I already had an appeal pending so I&#x27;d need to wait for it to be resolved. If I really cared that much, I could have tried again to explain again that actually it was their mistake, yada yada, but it wasn&#x27;t worth it. I didn&#x27;t want my account to be suspended again with very little recourse other than trying to use my network to get something done internally. Like with a corrupt cop, the prudent strategy was to just walk away and avoid conversation.<p>I&#x27;ve since stopped using Chrome, and I find that I prefer DuckDuckGo to Google (DDG feels like Google Search used to before $GOOG started blindly trusting deep learning to solve everything). I have hardened my resolve against ever touching an Android device, and I use an adblocker zealously. I haven&#x27;t fully moved my mail or DNS stuff away, but I am much more cautious. I didn&#x27;t realize in 2004 when I signed up for Gmail that I&#x27;d be entrusting my life&#x27;s records to an organization that makes the DMV look like an expert at efficiency and customer support.<p>I&#x27;d hope that OP and the various other developers here could maybe band together and maybe consult a lawyer. I have a feeling that given the legal realities of discrimination law and the like, Google&#x27;s policies and enforcement procedures are bound to be in violation, especially considering the law in its home state.

They avoid a lot of dark patterns, and this latest action of not charging customers who don&#x27;t watch is a very upstanding action, especially since it cuts into their profits in a really direct way.<p>There are still complaints I have about Netflix[3], but the real heart of  the issue is that this <i>cannot<\/i> last forever. There&#x27;s simply too much counter-incentive for a company to walk away from a revenue stream like this. And with a subscription business model, there&#x27;s nothing to keep them honest, because Netflix has all the control.<p>[1] This is a term I&#x27;m basically inventing on the spot, based on something I&#x27;ve been thinking about lately. Physical print newspapers were subscription based but they weren&#x27;t revocable-access: you received the newspaper on subscription, but once you received it, you owned it. This differs fundamentally from web-based subscriptions. With web-based subscriptions, if you let your subscription lapse, the site revokes your access to content which you previously had access to.<p>[2] Most people around me have Netflix subscriptions, so I end up watching a lot of Netflix with people, despite not having an account myself.<p>[3] a) Patterns that manipulate dopamine response. b) Glossing over credits so content creators don&#x27;t get credit. c) Monopolistic practiced with regard to tethering content creation and content distribution together."],"time":["2020-05-23 14:40:33"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jaakl"],"id":[23280618],"kids":[23281651],"parent":[23279160],"text":["It is not just ”altruistic”.

I can see a lot of really cool things coming from this once it&#x27;s multi platform.<p>2. Jai Language by Jonathan Blow. I&#x27;m not sure when it will come out but what&#x27;s been shown looks promising, a game specific language could cause other innovations that could later carry over to other languages.<p>3. Next Gen Consoles. X-box Series X and PS5 are both doing some cool things with memory management, SSD&#x27;s and GPU&#x27;s. Many of these innovations will make it to PC&#x27;s later.<p>4. New Email features (superhuman and HEY - by DHH) It seems like innovation is finally actually happening in this space.<p>5. Game Engine Innovations. Hammer 2 has some really cool UI for level design, Unreal 5 has some great lighting and handling of 3D, ID tech is using 3D decals to cool effect while not being expensive. A lot of the technology happening in games will spill over into other areas, Unity is doing stuff with the automative industry, Unreal with Architecture.<p>6. AI in use of Making Art. A good example is Unity&#x27;s new artengine (artomatix). <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;artomatix.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;artomatix.com&#x2F;<\/a><p>7.

You can see recent logged &quot;assessment&quot; checks logged in &quot;Mac Analytics Data&quot; with the search &quot;process:syspolicyd&quot;. You can use the same search to watch log messages (including all of the TLS negotiation etc.) for the checks in the device log.<p>The part that seems weird is that, if it is transmitting a hash (which seems possible&#x2F;logical) the caching behavior doesn&#x27;t appear to care or respect it?<p>The article suggests the following test:<p><pre><code>    echo $&#x27;#!&#x2F;bin&#x2F;sh\\necho Hello&#x27; &gt; &#x2F;tmp&#x2F;test.sh &amp;&amp; chmod a+x &#x2F;tmp&#x2F;test.sh\n    time &#x2F;tmp&#x2F;test.sh &amp;&amp; time &#x2F;tmp&#x2F;test.sh\n<\/code><\/pre>\nI tried this test and got real runtimes of 0m0.289s and 0m0.006s. Then, I changed the file:<p><pre><code>    echo $&#x27;#!&#x2F;bin&#x2F;sh\\necho Hellok&#x27; &gt; &#x2F;tmp&#x2F;test.sh &amp;&amp; chmod a+x &#x2F;tmp&#x2F;test.sh\n<\/code><\/pre>\nWhen I re-ran the script, both runs are under 10ms. The content changed, but it didn&#x27;t bother re-checking. I wrote the original script to a new file path:<p><pre><code>    echo $&#x27;#!&#x2F;bin&#x2F;sh\\necho Hello&#x27; &gt; &#x2F;tmp&#x2F;test2.sh &amp;&amp; chmod a+x &#x2F;tmp&#x2F;test2.sh\n<\/code><\/pre>\nThis ran with runtimes similar to the original (0m0.232s and 0m0.006s). Same content, new path, new check. Here too, if it cares about the hash, it either isn&#x27;t bothering to use it for caching decisions or the hash includes the path.<p>Then I tried rming the file, writing it again, and running it. Once again, it checks on the first request. I think this suggests it may be caching the result by inode? The author said they saw new checks after saving changes in TextEdit--I don&#x27;t know much about TextEdit, but I&#x27;d guess it is doing atomic write&#x2F;rename here.<p>Other random details I noticed:<p>1. it holds the connection open for a minute, presumably to minimize connection overhead for executions that&#x27;ll generate many checks. My first checks were all in the 280-300ms range, but I tried one additional check within the minute and it only took 72ms. Making multiple requests in less than a minute may make it harder to notice<p>2. The device log has a &quot;summary for task success&quot; entry with pretty precise timing details on all parts of the request.<p>3. On my system, each of these attempts produces a &quot;os_unix.c:43353: (2) open(&#x2F;var&#x2F;db&#x2F;DetachedSignatures) - No such file or directory&quot; error in the log from the libsqlite3 subsystem after the response comes back.<p>4. The &quot;Mac Analytics Data&quot; log entry for each request has a good summary that looks like:<p><pre><code>    assessment denied for test.sh\n    com.apple.message.domain: com.apple.security.assessment.outcome2\n    com.apple.message.signature2: bundle:UNBUNDLED\n    com.apple.message.signature3: test.sh\n    com.apple.message.signature5: UNKNOWN\n    com.apple.message.signature4: 1\n    com.apple.message.signature: denied:no usable signature\n    SenderMachUUID: ...snip...\n<\/code><\/pre>\n5. When I add Terminal to the Developer Tools exemption on the privacy tab it does appear to kill the check. I&#x27;m not sure if there&#x27;s genuine protection this check provides at some level, but I&#x27;ll be considering adding either Terminal or at least some specific build tools to the exemptions I add on a new system.<p>6. After adding the Developer Tools exemption, if you have the app open, it&#x27;ll ask if it can quit it for you. I took the hint and restarted Terminal. It&#x27;ll do the same thing when you remove it from the list. But I didn&#x27;t see the checks actually return until I rebooted. Also, my system froze during reboot. Hopefully a coincidence. :)<p>7. To put a better number on how this performance impact can compound for the kinds of builds I do all of the time, I ran `nix-build ci.nix` in the local directory for one of my projects before and after enabling the Developer Tools exemption for ~&#x2F;.nix-profile&#x2F;bin&#x2F;nix. The run took 1m22s before, 45.5s after.<p>8. Looks like this is the same check as is run by `spctl --asses -v &lt;path&gt;` (at least, per the Console.app logs).

Shannon limits to fiber transmission have pretty much been reached experimentally a long time ago. Muxing several wavelengths together is also of course the backbone of fiber optics transmission since its very origin. The current buzz in the field is to use micro-combs like they did as opposed to an array of lasers to provide the multiple wavelengths - but it still comes with its particular set of challenges to make it practical. The micro-comb provides the other wavelengths from a single source through a nonlinear process.<p>My understanding from just looking quickly at the paper is that they don&#x27;t modulate all the wavelengths independently, meaning that they duplicate the info they send several times to reach that high terabit rate. The laser source is only one part of a transceiver, and once you have 400+ independent modulators&#x2F;receivers, the laser source becomes a much smaller concern when it comes to make it practical. A conventional laser source can be made very compact too (in a semiconductor platform) and integrated with the rest of the transceiver on the same chip. This is still where the industry is putting its efforts. These micro-combs come with some disadvantages too, relating to stability, low SNR, and uneven power among the wavelengths (that then need to be equalized)."],"time":["2020-05-23 18:24:24"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["PopeDotNinja"],"id":[23282483],"kids":[23284531,23285051],"parent":[23282209],"text":["And even it that speed, I bet pre-roll ads on videos still end up buffering."],"time":["2020-05-23 14:46:31"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["vaer-k"],"id":[23283958],"kids":[23284039,23284005],"parent":[23282209],"text":["According to <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hpbn.co&#x2F;primer-on-latency-and-bandwidth&#x2F;#bandwidth-in-core-networks\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hpbn.co&#x2F;primer-on-latency-and-bandwidth&#x2F;#bandwidth-i...<\/a><p>&gt; As of early 2010, researchers have been able to multiplex over 400 wavelengths with the peak capacity of 171 Gbit&#x2F;s per channel, which translates to over 70 Tbit&#x2F;s of total bandwidth for a single fiber link!<p>So why&#x2F;how is 44 Tbps an improvement?"],"time":["2020-05-23 17:56:32"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ganzuul"],"id":[23284044],"kids":[23284597],"parent":[23282209],"text":["I have this funny idea about a waveguide interconnect, where MIMO radios address each other inside the manifold.

Like, the article notes, it worked for the iPod. For the iPad, it landed much softer than its predecessors, even if they still made a killing on sales.<p>The large format was awkward to hold as a content consumption device, and while it could have made for a neat content creation device, that never became a mass-market phenomenon. Later, smaller models were then eclipsed by phones that grew in size. Then, recently, the line was repositioned to import some more traditional computing expectations, after the Surface line proved that there was demand for that paradigm.<p>If you squint, you&#x27;ll notice that the iPad wasn&#x27;t a failure, but the critiques leveled against it at the time that challenged whether consumers would recognize that an iPad was something they needed turned out to be right. Those who waited and never bought an iPad were rewarded by phones that grew in size until they could reliably satisfy much of the iPad&#x27;s usecase. Those who used the iPad for content creation found that software was a significant part of their workflow, which translated poorly to competing platforms that later emerged to innovate with hardware -- so their long-term retention was a blend of lock-in and merit.<p>At first, the high price of the product initially contributed to a significant self-selection of its customer base -- by dissuading unsure prospects from an impulse buy; but this gatekeeping effect was lessened when smaller, cheaper models were introduced later. Gmail achieved gating through invitations; Facebook achieved gating through requiring an &quot;.edu&quot; email address. The iPad, Gmail, and Facebook all benefited from the marketing value of gating, but in the latter two&#x27;s case, the network effect kicked in in earnest once the gating was lifted. In the iPad&#x27;s case, once less-invested people began buying iPads, that now-shifting market of people began moving closer and closer to the consensus that it&#x27;s simply a Really Big iPhone, with all the benefits and drawbacks that come with that.<p>I&#x27;d generalize that lesson to say that your product must appeal to a self-selecting, highly-invested fan, so that it&#x27;s profitable to solely cater to them and ignore everyone else. Then, to survive an intentional or unintentional pivot to a more mass-market appeal, your product must readily offer a smooth and coherent way to satisfy a set of usability needs people currently have. Gmail, Facebook, the iPod, and the iPhone did this, but the iPad fell well short."],"time":["2020-05-23 09:37:47"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["zuhayeer"],"id":[23279537],"kids":{},"parent":[23275053],"text":["&gt; We took a similar approach when launching Gmail...
