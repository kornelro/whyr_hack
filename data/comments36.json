The main ones:<p>- Projects with distinct supporter bases will receive more funding if they join forces as a single project with more supporters<p>- Projects with few supporters that give a lot of money&#x2F;endorsement will receive very little boost from this<p>- You can also implement the possibility of &quot;negative votes&#x2F;funding&quot; that allow people to &quot;short&quot; the projects that they consider a net negative<p>Over the past year a grant matching mechanism using quadratic funding has been trialed in a platform called Gitcoin, which supports crowdfunding Ethereum development projects: \n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitcoin.co&#x2F;blog&#x2F;everything-you-need-to-know-about-gitcoin&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitcoin.co&#x2F;blog&#x2F;everything-you-need-to-know-about-gi...<\/a><p>A post by Vitalik Buterin describing quadratic funding is here:\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vitalik.ca&#x2F;general&#x2F;2019&#x2F;12&#x2F;07&#x2F;quadratic.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vitalik.ca&#x2F;general&#x2F;2019&#x2F;12&#x2F;07&#x2F;quadratic.html<\/a><p>Vitalik also wrote about the last 3 rounds of this funding on Gitcoin, they’ve been making tweaks and the results are extremely promising:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vitalik.ca&#x2F;general&#x2F;2020&#x2F;04&#x2F;30&#x2F;round5.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vitalik.ca&#x2F;general&#x2F;2020&#x2F;04&#x2F;30&#x2F;round5.html<\/a>\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vitalik.ca&#x2F;general&#x2F;2020&#x2F;01&#x2F;28&#x2F;round4.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vitalik.ca&#x2F;general&#x2F;2020&#x2F;01&#x2F;28&#x2F;round4.html<\/a>\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vitalik.ca&#x2F;general&#x2F;2019&#x2F;10&#x2F;24&#x2F;gitcoin.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vitalik.ca&#x2F;general&#x2F;2019&#x2F;10&#x2F;24&#x2F;gitcoin.html<\/a><p>The idea of quadratic funding came from quadratic voting, which was discussed in the 2018 book Radical Markets: \n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vitalik.ca&#x2F;general&#x2F;2018&#x2F;04&#x2F;20&#x2F;radical_markets.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vitalik.ca&#x2F;general&#x2F;2018&#x2F;04&#x2F;20&#x2F;radical_markets.html<\/a><p>In september 2018 Vitalik together with one of the book authors and another person put out a preprint describing their ideas for quadratic funding, which is very interestingly written:\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;1809.06421.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;1809.06421.pdf<\/a><p>The broader field under which this fits is called &quot;mechanism design&quot;, which means inverse game theory: instead of specifying the rules and seeing what the outcome is, you decide which outcome you want and try to design a game that leads to it...a very enticing idea.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Mechanism_design\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Mechanism_design<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-17 06:16:37"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["godelski"],"id":[23209788],"kids":[23211917],"parent":[23208235],"text":["If you like this, you&#x27;ll probably be interested in STAR[0]. It has a really high voter satisfaction efficiency[1]. Pretty much it is the best if you want to account for strategic voting[2] (Condorcet methods don&#x27;t handle these as well, but do have a higher VSE when it isn&#x27;t accounted for, but we&#x27;re talking pretty close anyways).<p>So why Cardinal systems? They are a lot easier than ranked systems. You like two people equally? You hate two people equally? No worries, just give them the same number. You basically have all the advantages in this case (I&#x27;ll mention that Gibbard&#x27;s[3] is an extension of Arrow&#x27;s and it applies here). But why we would want this system is because it makes for the best of both worlds between the &quot;we need parties&quot; and &quot;fuck parties&quot; groups.<p>Let&#x27;s take an example: Pick your favorite outside candidate: Bernie, Tulsi, Warren, Yang. If the general election was using STAR it wouldn&#x27;t matter who the Dems pushed. You could still vote for these candidates and it wouldn&#x27;t help you&#x27;re candidate win. So I&#x27;d imagine a HN ballot could look something like this<p>Biden: 5<p>Gabbard: 7<p>Sanders: 10<p>Trump: 3<p>Warren: 9<p>Yang: 8<p>If Bernie, Tulsi, Warren, and Yang did not get enough votes to win, it would still be like the same election where we are choosing Biden v Trump, even though Biden wasn&#x27;t your first choice. This means you can vote honestly (i.e. which candidate is closest to your opinion and not which candidate you think can win). It entirely removes the &quot;electibility&quot; question.<p>Why cardinal over ranked? One simple answer is that when cardinal breaks down it turns into approval voting. Approval voting is &quot;I like this candidate&quot; vs &quot;I dislike this candidate&quot;. It is essentially the way we pick where to eat with friends. Everyone says &quot;I don&#x27;t know&quot;. So you start listing off places and once enough people say &quot;sure&quot;, you pick that. It doesn&#x27;t get you the best place to eat, but no one is really unhappy either. What STAR does is basically give you the options: &quot;Hate it&quot;, &quot;no&quot;, &quot;ehhh&quot;, &quot;I guess&quot;, &quot;fine&quot;, &quot;yes&quot;, &quot;hell fucking yeah&quot; (that&#x27;d be STAR06).<p>STAR is simple to understand, leads to high voter satisfaction, removes the electibility issue, let&#x27;s parties exist without parties dominating (i.e. other parties can actually compete), easy to pick a winner, and more qualities we like in voting systems (if you&#x27;re trying to make a fair system where people get representatives that represent their ideals). Of course, this does not fix the issues of money in politics, people lying, and all that.<p>This is just one component, but I think an essential component that will have huge effects on any democratically elected system and I think it is something that we really should fight for. It is also easy to sell the idea because everyone wants a more fair voting system.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;STAR_voting\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;STAR_voting<\/a><p>[1]<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;electionscience.github.io&#x2F;vse-sim&#x2F;VSE&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;electionscience.github.io&#x2F;vse-sim&#x2F;VSE&#x2F;<\/a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Tactical_voting\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Tactical_voting<\/a><p>[3] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Gibbard%27s_theorem\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Gibbard%27s_theorem<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-17 07:26:37"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["sandworm101"],"id":[23209684],"kids":[23209997,23210021],"parent":[23208235],"text":["&gt;&gt; Using this anonymous ballot system provides identity protection from vote buying or trading since these exchanges cannot be verified by the buyer or trader.<p>I&#x27;m really split on that one.

In last few version of NodeJS, many security flaws have been addressed, see their changelog if you dont believe me. But most importantly, security flaws with native JS is handled by V8 which is common to both NodeJS and Deno. On top of that, most of the libraries and frameworks in NodeJS during their various releases sorted out many security issues in their code. If someone is still doubtful they can use eslint-plugins for sanity and security checks in their JS files. Adopting Typescript also helps if you cant live without types.<p>3.

You have arrived at a kind of limbo that in all likelihood you will end up at again in the future. I congratulate you, because you have arrived at the point where you have &quot;synced&quot; -- that is to say, you have processed material from your desired channels from the post to the present moment such that this feeling you are experiencing, an almost emptiness or that of negative space, encapsulates and closes in upon the definition of &quot;present moment&quot;.<p>Give it a day, and new content will arrive in your familiar channels. You&#x27;ll consume it, and return to this familiar, interstitial area.<p>Perhaps now is as good a time as any to consider directionality. Is it a good time to go back on material you&#x27;ve previously processed and re-process it for refinement? It will only deepen your intuition and the firmness of your intellectual grip. Is it time for you to seek out a new channel, as you&#x27;re doing here? That too, is a new adventure. Is it maybe time to begin forming your own channel? So too could that be a new adventure.<p>And if none of those sound appealing? Well, perhaps that is even more appealing. Perhaps you, like many other folks, have finally come to that point where you ask &quot;what&#x27;s next?&quot; to a deafeningly loud internal silence. This is good. This is where the interesting stuff happens.<p>If I can give you a word of advice -- don&#x27;t feel so inclined to have to come up with an answer immediately. It&#x27;s possible that you may need to keep your internal eyes and ears open for when the answer finds &#x2F;you&#x2F;.<p>And to answer your question in a more literal manner -- take a look at what you&#x27;ve liked, commented on, and favorited on Hacker News. You can probably identify some areas that you tend to enjoy exploring. Try and find folks&#x2F;communal spaces on Twitter and Reddit (maybe YouTube too, if possible) that  also explore those areas. From there, you can branch out, whether it&#x27;s talking directly with those folks to get a sense of what they think is interesting that you might not know about (this is the best way, IMO) or following new paths out further.<p>But, I will stress: try and soak in the feeling and fully absorb it.

In terms of your tech stack choices, this would mean technologies that will be easier to maintain, require fewer updates in the future and have a sufficient level of performance.<p>In contrast, &quot;power-ups&quot; are extremely useful right now, but not so broadly applicable or evergreen. In terms of learning, this means things like the knowledge of the hottest social media growth channel of the moment, frequently changing JavaScript frameworks, popular 3rd-party tools and platforms (i.e. Firebase APIs, Auth0, various &quot;back-end as a service&quot; offerings, etc).<p>Keep in mind, the &quot;engine&quot; vs &quot;power-up&quot; concept is more of a spectrum than a dichotomy.

How do you pick a subject or tool to learn?<p>To the last 2 questions: I don&#x27;t really.<p>But to the first question: I read widely, but I also add an accelerant to the process -- Pluralsight. (or, insert your favorite screencast&#x2F;tech pedagogy site here)<p>Pluralsight has videos that are of high pedagogical quality -- low or variable quality sites are a waste of time -- because instructors are curated (and I hear, auditioned).  Sometimes I just want to see how something is done by an expert. I hate to admit it but I&#x27;m partial to learning by mimicry (at least at first).<p>Docs are good as a reference, but it&#x27;s tedious and slow to mentally parse step-by-step instructions and scaffolding code in docs -- there&#x27;s just too much context switching for my liking. Much easier to watch a video at 1.5x speed, where someone is doing it and explaining at the same time.<p>For instance, I tried learning K8S by reading blogs and docs but didn&#x27;t really see how everything fit together until I watched some videos of an expert actually explaining and assembling stuff starting from zilch all the way to a working setup.<p>Downside: these sites only cover established technologies.

Thorough learning meaning, for important things I try to understand the system end to end by reading unabridged and quality documentation, taking the time to comprehend along the way, realizing that this is a slow process but in the long run worthwhile. Reflection meaning that after a learning period I&#x27;ll take time to reflect, on the meta level, how things are going and what I could do to improve. I reflect by keeping a log, with an entry for &quot;thoughts&quot; and an entry for &quot;lessons&quot;. In the thoughts section I just freeform write whatever I felt about the recent learning period and in the lessons section I summarize any actionable things from my thoughts, if any (and I don&#x27;t force myself to come up with lessons if there aren&#x27;t any). Generally, if I struggled a lot with something I&#x27;ll pull lessons out and if it was easy I may not have anything in the lessons section.<p>For example, last year I started using python more at work. I&#x27;ve known python in the sense that I could write scripts in it and generally understand it, but my knowledge was mainly based on having seen python scripts, intuition, and Google searches - and mostly python2.<p>Putting my first principle into play, I looked at the python documentation and read it end to end. I tried to read one section a day, though some sections are more or less dense so that was very flexible. As I read I had a Jupyter Notebook open and played around with every concept the documentation described. When I was done reading I would spend a few minutes writing my notes as described above.<p>This took maybe 30 minutes a day, most days, for a little less than a month.

So you have to iterate over a topic in order to feel familiar with it&#x27;s vocabulary. Just think of those Wikipedia rampages where you go deeper and deeper down certain words until you don&#x27;t know where you originated from: that&#x27;s because you are not familiar with the vocabulary of the field. So my first step is to learn the vocabulary of the topic by 1: reading a short book about the basics (or the first 100 pages or something) and 2: I find a place (online) where people working in this field hang out (e.g Reddit, HN etc.) and just read what kind of problems they have, which kind of words and tools they are using which kind of projects they work on. I do this daily, multiple times, and follow on things that really spark my interest and try to understand as much as possible. My brain works very interest based. I try to answer simple questions in forums, and try to get involved but only in simple stuff (since obviously I am just learning). At this point I try to apply the very basic things i&#x27;ve learned and iterate myself further by asking basic questions about stuff I don&#x27;t understand etc. After having reached a certain familiarity with vocabulary and basics I try to explain why does tool X exist, what problem does it solve, what pros and cons exist. I think about how I would explain the necessity of X to someone who is not in the field. After that in the second phase I learn mostly like everybody else from books, online resources and just doing what I learn. But now I can read books a lot faster and with much fewer frustration because my brain is familiar with it, knows why X exists and which cool projects X is applied to. Thinking about it, my strategy is mostly tricking my brain into not being bored or overwhelmed.<p>2. How do you decide what to learn:\nI learn because my job requires me to be familiar with Y. That&#x27;s one part, can&#x27;t really change much about that. The second part, for me personally is purely interest based. I always try to learn concepts&#x2F;methods instead of tools. Don&#x27;t care if it is useful or you will ever really apply it, BUT: if I learned a useful concept instead of a tool, I will always be ready to apply it somewhere else. We humans are masters in generalizing things and applying concepts we have seen somewhere else.<p>Since you asked about HYPE-TECH-A vs something that truly interests you: I always in my life picked my interests not the hype, and it always worked out. If you are motivated to learn something you can gain knowledge several times faster compared to force feeding yourself something that you might apply maybe somewhere in the future.<p>4. How do you handle the pressure of that huge mountain of stuff you don&#x27;t know:<p>Just have a good mental health. Be aware that staring to long into the abyss of stuff you don&#x27;t know will never lead to anything good. You have to be aware of the things that you don&#x27;t know, but let it give you a joyful humbleness instead of fear. Just think about it this way: you will never run out of interesting things to learn. The joy of learning will always be available. Your mind is not a commodity of your future employer, instead learning new things should be your privilege and bring you joy."],"time":["2020-05-17 14:58:05"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["lallysingh"],"id":[23211630],"kids":[23211739],"parent":[23211184],"text":["My learning strategy has a few parts:<p>(1) Projects as the top-level structure.  [Lookup: Ultralearning - a book&#x2F;website (get the book).  It covers designing learning projects.]  This is the backbone of how to learn anything technical - you have to build using it.<p>(2) An Injest Feed - When you read something, put together a process to preserve and organize what you take in:\n  (a) Organize the information against some current or future learning project.  Direct your learning with intention.\n  (b) Capture the interesting parts for later study. One direct output of reading should be notes and review cards.<p>(3) A Review Process - I use a combination of Anki and Readwise. To review them later.<p>(4) Personal Tooling - I do <i>not<\/i> try to keep it all in my brain.  The review process is to keep things fairly fresh, but I&#x27;m only keeping the big points and indices in-core.  The rest is out in my tools.  Evernote, readwise, and anki are basic elements.<p>Then I set up software for specific tasks.  I don&#x27;t have to do much: just organize what I can get off-the-shelf and then organize it, with little bits of glue to do what I need.  E.g., org-mode for writing and planning (I&#x27;m currently experimenting with integrating taskjuggler), calibre for book management, polar for injesting papers, etc.<p>--<p>For your list of topics, it sounds like you need to build a small go app to run on AWS, perhaps on minikube.  That&#x27;s all fine.  Now put it together with a subproblem you want to actually solve.  Say a prototype of something you think you should build at work, or just a toy you want to make for fun, or a startup idea.<p>I&#x27;ve focused on a process for learning instead of strategy because I&#x27;ve done this stuff for decades.  You have to be efficient, strategic, and retain what you&#x27;ve learned.  You need to have enough of it out of your head -- into text you can review and think about -- that you can continue to update your strategy as you go into the project.  It&#x27;s too easy to get flooded with technical minutiae if you don&#x27;t keep the top-level objectives in front of your face.  Keeping notes will prevent you from dumbly reading forum posts late at night, because you know there&#x27;s no useful notes to be made from them.<p>Doing a few of these projects and not retaining their output is demoralizing.  In absence of an intentional retainment plan, you&#x27;ll remember whatever obstacles you hit more than the things you wanted to learn.  Those will be muscle memory and feel good for a little while, but that memory will whither 2 projects later, and you&#x27;ve lost the point.<p>The feeling of heavy work and little work can burn you out.  This is a marathon, not a race.

In the course, myself and a bunch of aspiring bureaucrats (I was living in Canada at the time, where French accreditation opens up advancement opportunities for government employees) met twice a week and did as little work as possible to get a passing grade. We did the usual second language learning things: memorizing the names of animals (as if we were all preparing for a career in agriculture), watching low budget educational films, and filling out verb conjugation worksheets. Our instructor was good - she could explain concepts clearly and managed to stimulate a fair deal of discussion. But she was bound to a curriculum that heavily emphasized grammar and a particular vocabulary, and neither could motivate me.<p>Last year I decided to learn Swedish. Instead of signing up for community college courses, I started taking private lessons over Skype. I found a tutor with whom I share similar interests. We discuss things we&#x27;ve read, our favourite tv shows, and philosophy. I also started reading American mystery novels in translation. It turns out this is a highly effective learning mechanism, because you have a lot of context. It works especially well if there is a series you like, for the same reason.<p>Once I started asking &quot;what is most enjoyable way to make this happen,&quot; and stopped worrying about what learning methodologies are efficient, scientific, or conventional, I saw a lot more progress. I only reach for Google translate a couple times per page when I&#x27;m reading a mystery, and I have about half my 1on1s in Swedish.<p>[0] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.paulgraham.com&#x2F;love.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.paulgraham.com&#x2F;love.html<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-17 16:12:23"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["topkai22"],"id":[23213318],"kids":{},"parent":[23211184],"text":["I actively think about three levels of knowledge that I need to acquire-\nBroad- keeping up with changes in the overall industry. At this level I&#x27;m just trying to learn all the new things that  are popping up, when they would be  applied, alternatives, and  maybe strengths and weaknesses. I mostly use podcasts for this, supplemented by reading HN and  other tech news, easier to read books (like the Phoenix project), tech conference keynotes and  detailed schedules (there is a ton of information to be gained just reading what people are  presenting on), occasionally attending a conference, and  occasional community meet ups, if those start happening again.<p>I do broad learning constantly, several hours a week, and it&#x27;s mostly fun.<p>Deep- occasionally I&#x27;ll do a deep dive into a new technology that I learn about I&#x27;m doing my broad learning. This happens because I&#x27;ve identified it as a broad industry trend that I simply need to understand (containers and kubernetes a few years back), something that I sense might be applicable to a current or upcoming project (most recently React), or just because I&#x27;m interested (augmented reality.) I use a mixture of training courses (pluralsight and  o reilly because work gives me a subscription, or vendor provided learning material from the likes of  Apple or Microsoft) and some hobbyists level effort capstone project. This  takes about 40-80h and I often do the project as part of a hackathon. I rarely do this level of learning more than once a year and sometimes less than that. The goal isn&#x27;t too become an expert, but just to be able to accomplish work in the new technology.<p>Immediate- learning as part of my day to day job. This is learning I get from having to figure out tasks (deeply reading the docs of our current tech stack to figure an obscure error), to evaluate a technology or technique against our current needs, or to learn a new technology that is part part of the job &#x2F;a new project or team I&#x27;ve joined. Most of this is one the job learning or learning from others on my team, but sometimes there are relevant trainings. There is no real time metric here- it just happens.<p>As for your concern about being up to date on every single technology that might be listed on a job  description, don&#x27;t be. Most job descriptions are &quot;aspirational.&quot; Few hiring managers expect to be able to get the &quot;perfect&quot; candidate. What they are  really looking for is high potential and a short ramp time.

You are 5 years in. Most likely there have  been people you genuinely like that have moved on to different teams, roles, or companies. Reach out to them, find out how they are doing, what they are working on, chat about whatever you used to chat about. Trust me, people are happy you thought about them enough to reach out to them and are generally happy to talk. What your friends are working on should give you a good idea of what&#x27;s actually important to know.

You can do this using the Foucault knife-edge test [1] [2].<p>&gt; It measures mirror surface dimensions by reflecting light into a knife edge at or near the mirror&#x27;s centre of curvature. In doing so, it only needs a tester which in its most basic 19th century form consists of a light bulb, a piece of tinfoil with a pinhole in it, and a razor blade to create the knife edge.<p>Of course you don&#x27;t need a light bulb. A candle will do. This means that once you have a level of technology that can make glass discs, candles, something opaque with a way to make a pinhole in it, something opaque with a thin straight edge, abrasive grit in a range of sizes, and some way to coat a glass surface with a thin layer of metal, you can make telescope mirrors.<p>Much of that could be done in ancient times. The only things on that list I&#x27;m not sure about are abrasive grit and coating the mirror.<p>You want a series of grits from coarse to very fine, and I have no idea when grit making became refined enough to have such a range of sizes.<p>Coating a mirror can be done with silver. Here are some instructions for doing it at home [3]. You need silver nitrate, ammonium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, detergent, acetone, and nitric acid if you follow this instructions, plus assorted hardware like stirring rods, absorbent cotton, beakers and bottles, and that kind of thing.

On windows desktop GUI front I was using Delphi since 90s and barring few easily fixable hick ups what did work then works as a charm even now. So instead of wasting my time on their infinite ever changing set of front end tech I stayed on a proven path and that saved me a ton of money.

The real problem is the ecosystem. I&#x27;ve hardly used rust enough to feel like I&#x27;ve got a really broad feel for the ecosystem, but the feeling I have at the moment is that its quite possible to hit deal breaker levels of problems when attempting to combine differing libraries into the same application. Particularity when one is using threads in an application. I needed to pass one libraries reference into a thread, where another library needed to have the instance used in a closure. It turned out to be impossible without either using unsafe code or adding additional traits to both libraries. A trick made much harder because I then had to wrangle cargo to pick up internally maintained versions of libraries instead of the main cargo repos.<p>So, I get the distinct feeling that rust is great if you can stick to a single threaded programs, or you don&#x27;t rely on 3rd party libraries.

Lots of other systems have similar parameters. The fundamental idea is that randomness sources are sometimes subject to failure, especially as you ask for more and more random data (e.g., until recently, &#x2F;dev&#x2F;random on Linux would block if it &quot;didn&#x27;t have enough entropy&quot;, and there have been plenty of issues related to code NOT CHECKING for short reads). The NIST spec suggests using things like serial numbers, user IDs, MAC addresses, software versions, timestamps, module and applications, even random numbers derived from other sources as parts of the personalization string. The idea is that each PRNG created will always have at least one unique input to it, so you at least avoid repeated outputs if the seeds and the nonces get hosed up.<p>So there&#x27;s a case to be made for hauling in low-randomness data, even if it doesn&#x27;t help accumulate enough randomness. The hostname certainly isn&#x27;t perfect (think of all those Raspberry Pis with the same hostname), but it doesn&#x27;t HURT as long as we&#x27;re honest about what that input is providing (distinction versus randomness).<p>Also: the author notes that some of the random sources they tested are highly biased. While biased output from a random source isn&#x27;t GREAT, it isn&#x27;t necessarily a showstopper. The key thing for security in this context is not a lack of bias, but a lack of predictability. Suppose I have a biased random source, with a 1&#x2F;3 probability of outputting a 1, and a 2&#x2F;3 probability of outputting a 0. If there&#x27;s nobody out there who can predict the NEXT output with probability greater than 2&#x2F;3 (i.e., it&#x27;s not backdoored or subject to some nasty attack), then it&#x27;s just fine as a random source. We just can&#x27;t treat each bit we read as providing a &quot;full bit&quot; of random into the system. In the example above, you could just seed your 256-bit PRNG with about 280 bits of biased input. Alternatively, you could just do the old &quot;read twice: discard if results match; otherwise take the first value&quot; trick to get an unbiased source.<p>Also, it&#x27;s important to remember that &quot;entropy&quot; in these conversations is used in a squishy way, and it&#x27;s easy to mix up different definitions of the term. Folks talking about &quot;entropy&quot; in the context of PRNGs usually mean unpredictability, unstructuredness, unrecoverability, or some combination thereof. They typically do <i>not<\/i> mean Shannon entropy, which is essentially a measure of UNIFORMITY of output . If you feed the numbers 0 through 255-- in order-- into an entropy calculator, it will report exactly 8 bits of entropy, even though the input was clearly structured and predictable. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;ve tried to avoid using the term &quot;entropy&quot; and focus on &quot;random&quot; or &quot;randomness&quot;.<p>As for backdoors-- it&#x27;s theoretically possible that things like RDRAND or a USB key or whatever can be compromised. Standard, non-dedicated randomness inputs (like keystroke timing, network packet arrival times, disk I&#x2F;O info, interrupt timing, clock drift, etc.) are still included in OS PRNGs, and PRNG state is periodically updated to fold in that randomness.

The time on all contemporary computers is always Unix Epoch Time, which is close to (but not exactly) UTC. Setting your timezone doesn&#x27;t actually change anything about how time works on the computer. It just changes how time is printed. That&#x27;s it.<p>So the second problem is that our text-based server world, for all its benefits, doesn&#x27;t cope well with per-user parameters. I mean ... timezone support on Unix is basically buggy. It doesn&#x27;t matter what TZ I set in my .profile, nevertheless the timezone of logs is in whatever TZ the server is running in. That&#x27;s pretty stupid. And even simple calculations like &quot;how many seconds elapsed between this log entry and this one&quot; - which is really common - are very difficult, regardless of the TZ setting.<p>In my own personal perfect world, all logs would be printed in the first column of log files using the epoch time in seconds, and we&#x27;d have a command which would convert from the epoch time to the local timezone. So we could do something like:<p><pre><code>   tail -f &#x2F;var&#x2F;log&#x2F;messages | grep &#x27;panic&#x27; | timestamp\n<\/code><\/pre>\n...in which case I would be able to choose the timezone and format of the timestamps to meet the needs of the job i was doing.<p>So for me, this whole argument over UTC is dumb. It doesn&#x27;t matter what timezone the system is set to; any zone can be &quot;default&quot;. The real problem is that different users have different time formatting requirements, and to date we haven&#x27;t had tools which deal with that properly.<p>(even logging all timestamps consistently in ISO format would be a big step up...)"],"time":["2020-05-17 09:25:45"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mattlondon"],"id":[23210577],"kids":{},"parent":[23209955],"text":["This is a common view I&#x27;ve seen.<p>It usually starts like this &quot; but we&#x27;re all in &lt;tz&gt; so we should just use that so no one needs to do any maths.&quot;<p>Then later when operations spread to elsewhere it becomes &quot;but <i>most<\/i> stuff is still done in &lt;original tz&gt; so we will still use that and everyone in other places will just need to deal with it and use our &#x27;real&#x27; tz.&quot;<p>Then when you are operating in 3 or 4 or 5 or more locations it is too late to change anything and you are screwed because now you are in some provincial timezone for 50% of your systems - complete with clock changes - and the rest are a mess of either in UTC <i>or<\/i> some other TZ local to that server with their own <i>different<\/i> clock changes to the original TZ.

One says that this is great, and we should continue every effort possible to stop the spread, presumably for an unlimited number of months or even years. That means staying locked down with minimal economic activity and somehow dealing with the consequences as they come. This is the &quot;wait for the vaccine&quot; camp, which I find hard to join because even <i>if<\/i> a safe vaccine can be created, it could be a year or two before it is sufficiently tested and deployed. California seems to be leading this camp in the US.<p>The second camp says that excess healthcare capacity means we should begin reopening the economy until capacity becomes strained. This is the &quot;let the virus spread&quot; camp, and implicit in the argument is that we should allow more people to die from the virus. This camp is winning. Most states and Western nations have started to ease restrictions knowing full well that it means the virus will spread. The hope is that less stringent restrictions can still allow the rate of transmission to be controlled enough to avoid catastrophe.<p>(There is also a third, fringe camp in the US of right-wingers, and while it is easy to dismiss them, they are actually winning in states like Georgia and Texas)<p>My understanding at the start of lockdowns was that these were intended to &quot;bend the curve&quot; so we could get control of the situation and then allow the virus to spread at a rate that would not overwhelm healthcare capacity. But more and more people I know seem to be in the &quot;wait for a vaccine&quot; camp. Personally, my imagination struggles to comprehend what another 12+ months of lockdowns would mean for civilization.

Electron supports Objective-C, C++, Rust, and obviously WASM (amongst others). If you want to build native code (and native UI) in any of these languages, go for it. Countless Electron apps have native components.<p>&gt; It has no type safety, memory leaks are common and it’s slow due to its dynamic nature.<p>TypeScript has been a thing for a while now. [Citation needed] for the statement that memory leaks are more common than in, say, C++. Slow: Yes, it&#x27;s slower, but probably by _a lot_ less than you think[1].<p>&gt; And it’s laughable how weak the browser platform itself is. SQLite is available on raspberry pi, embeddable systems, mobile platforms and just about every other platform on the planet.<p>I agree, SQLite is fantastic. We don&#x27;t really have to argue whether IndexDB will get thee job done, because native bindings to use SQLite with Electron exist. Just... use it.<p>And lastly...<p>&gt; These days to send a text message over Slack I need over 1GB of RAM.

Even if you&#x27;re a heavy user, your memory _should_ be below one GB. To be clear, I&#x27;ll say it again: Yes, things should be better and we&#x27;ll keep working on performance. The post mentioned Instagram earlier, which I&#x27;d say goes a bit beyond the most basic app, and it&#x27;s using a humble 40MB on my machine.<p>Disclaimer: I&#x27;m one of the maintainers of Electron and an engineer at Slack.

I also happen to think that&#x27;s a good thing.<p>The issue is that developing for a particular OS is, generally, more difficult than developing for the web. The app delivery mechanism is also more convoluted (for native apps) than simply entering a web address in the browser. The web also seems to have more ubiquitous standards that abstract away the differences between OSs - you can, with a high degree of certainty, ensure that your app is usable by 99% of computer users, given the current software they have on their device - with native apps, there is no such guarantee, especially if you&#x27;re relying on shared libraries.<p>Browsers are also becoming more feature rich. This has had a negative impact on their memory consumption, but given it&#x27;s 2020, some may retort &quot;memory is cheap&quot; (I totally disagree with this way of thinking personally). And while some browsers (Chrome, looking especially at you) do a <i>very<\/i> poor job of memory management, I believe the competitive nature of the browser market will force a reawakening soon, where a lot of the inefficiencies in memory management will have to be eradicated (or vendors risk losing market share). Think back to 2014&#x2F;15 when Node.js was really becoming established - the PHP team suddenly felt a need to re-optimise their engine for PHP7 (and with dramatic results)... Point is, only after ~20 years at the top did something spur PHP&#x27;s team on enough to do something about their inefficiencies.<p>Finally, I can see a future where the line between web and native apps is even more blurred. WebAssembly is the first step, however things could get even more elaborate. Perhaps we could end up with the ability to start docker-like containers from within web apps (given the right permissions, of course) to spin up servers for audio&#x2F;video&#x2F;image processing on the client itself, and interact with them via a web page. If we get to this point, native apps may feel even more obsolete.<p>I know this post relates primarily to the current state, but I felt the need to talk about the future to highlight the marked difference in the rate of innovation in the web ecosystem (fast) vs the native ecosystem (slower). It would not surprise me if the web ecosystem ends up winning in the end. If I was building an app today, and it only requires features I can deliver via the browser, I would almost certainly go the web app route.<p>Now, if I was building a video processing app today, I&#x27;d almost certainly go native, but in a couple of years, my answer may be very different."],"time":["2020-05-18 00:19:38"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jwilliams"],"id":[23216151],"kids":[23216218],"parent":[23215882],"text":["This is an interesting debate, but I don’t think this is useful framing:<p>“And it’s laughable how weak the browser platform itself is.”<p>Which begs the question of why then do developers use web&#x2F;electron?<p>Ubuiqity, cross-platform, distribution, updates... and, yes, some developers also prefer web api.<p>Perhaps the question is how do we bring a web&#x2F;election experience to native apps?"],"time":["2020-05-18 00:36:25"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["thethethethe"],"id":[23216078],"kids":[23216169,23216324,23216098,23216096],"parent":[23215882],"text":["Seems like the only argument here is: “web apps are slow and use a lot of resources”<p>This isn’t a great argument by itself.

If using advanced tools like SPA frameworks is the only way to retain my sanity, I&#x27;m going to use them. (And yes the author also parodied the churn of web technologies, not going to deny that)<p>Perhaps there should be a fast alternative to the current web, where the biggest goal is to serve pages with lighting speed. It could be architected from ground up to come with built-in SPA support, that would load the pages in chunks while offering a smooth browsing experience. It could automatically adjust to the device and the network speed of the user, and have all the legacy cruft of the old web removed. So basically like AMP, but without Google&#x27;s greedy fingers.<p>Yet the chances of that happening is probably zero, as where&#x27;s the money in that. A secondary web just for power-users?

With Github pages, Blogger, Netlify, and many more platforms, the only cost you&#x27;re going to incur is a domain name and even that isn&#x27;t mandatory.

Premade templates, static site generators, WYSIWYG editors and more have made the barrier to entry lower than ever.<p>Which brings me to my last point, audience. Audience is one of the most recurring themes of woes and, I would say, the most childish. Wanting to be heard is a reasonable wish, along with wanting to belong and many other basic traits. However, demanding to be heard is something else entirely. Your blog wont attract thousands of regular readers from day one and in hoping so, you&#x27;re simply setting yourself up for failure. The truth is, if you write good content, the readers will come.<p>Even with that said, I would argue that having readers isn&#x27;t a good end for your means in and of itself. Much like chasing popularity just because, obsessing over SEO, analytics and all that other jazz is simply trying to feed your ego. Tame your ego, and write about what matters to you.

Not just the popularity of it, but the expectations of both the writer and reader. When Twitter launched, it was described as a &quot;micro-blog&quot;, because that&#x27;s what it is, really, before morphing into its own thing: a tweet.<p>We all know what a tweet is: A short polemic statement, usually emotional, biased or opinionated, but expressed as self-evident without any justification, explanation or thorough analysis, which simply wouldn&#x27;t fit.<p>I was an avid blogger at the time Twitter started, thousands of daily readers, and relatively influential in my tech niche. I had every reason to continue. And yet after I started tweeting regularly, my blogging slowed and then stopped. That day had passed, and now my blog sits on my website like a monument to the 2000s. Many others were like this as well.<p>The reason is pretty simple: When you blog regularly, there&#x27;s a certain itch to express an idea or an opinion that builds up and you want to scratch it by writing a post. But you&#x27;d ruminate on it for a while, so that it could be a decent sized post with rationale for your thought.<p>But tweeting could scratch that itch instantly - no need to save up enough of an idea to write a full blog post of a few paragraphs, you could just write, &quot;Wow, foo sucks. Totally prefer bar instead.&quot; And the feeling was satisfied.<p>You&#x27;d think at the time that you&#x27;d save up some ideas and write a longer post later, and at first you did, but as time went by, later never seemed to come. And then, when it did, you&#x27;d be so used to culling your opinion down to the essential idea for a pithy tweet, fully expressing your thought became harder. Besides, the more open-ended a tweet was, the more opinionated, the more it would get reactions. It seemed that expressing fully formed ideas wasn&#x27;t worth as much.<p>It was a vicious cycle, you&#x27;d blog less. And others who used to blog their ideas or leave comments wrote less as well, and that great feedback loop stalled as everything moved to tweets. Intelligent analysis was replaced by emotional exclamations and hard opinion. There&#x27;s no room for nuance in a tweet.<p>And that&#x27;s where we are now. With a president who&#x27;s a master of tweeting unjustified, irrational opinion and lies and a society that responds in kind because doing otherwise takes too much time and effort.<p>Blogging is never coming back.

No need to redo the layout or apply the latest design trends. HN is fine as is.<p>- Respect the original design. The dark version uses the same color hierarchy as the elements in the original design.<p>- No-nonsense. All colors are pure grayscale.<p>- Simple. Only minimally adjusted the CSS ( <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;monokai.nl&#x2F;lab&#x2F;hacker-news&#x2F;news.css\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;monokai.nl&#x2F;lab&#x2F;hacker-news&#x2F;news.css<\/a> ). This can be easily implemented in the current CSS using some media queries. I only added one thing in the HTML which is a span around the karma points at the top.<p>- Keep the orange. This was a puzzle. I think the original bar is too jarring on a dark background. But, HN is not HN without a touch of orange. I decided to style the top links only. This keeps the soul of HN.<p>- Readability. You should be comfortable reading this dark mode in low light. Too much contrast doesn&#x27;t read nicely, but the original HN text has a lot of contrast with its #000 on an off-white background. My dark background is off-black and the text is turned down a notch from pure white. If you need less contrast, you can turn down the brightness of your display.<p>- The upvote triangles are unicode now inserted via CSS. Saves a request and doesn&#x27;t render pixelated on Retina.<p>- Best thing. All comments are placed on a big slab of #2a2a2a.
