I was doing fine with no problems from lack of sleep, and then one day after about a year I stopped being able to think clearly. I was having real trouble thinking or learning new things and had a bad headache. I went to my doctor and she immediately scheduled an MRI because she thought I might have a brain tumor. I was scared shitless, but I was able to get the MRI the next day. After the results came back negative for brain tumor, I thought maybe it&#x27;s sleep, so I left work in the middle of the day and fell asleep and slept for about 16 hours. I realized right there and then I was sleep deprived, so I stopped trading immediately and focused on trying to sleep properly.<p>These days I need close to 7.5 hrs of sleep a day and if I get less, I&#x27;ll feel it pretty quickly as opposed to 10 years ago when I felt nothing."],"time":["2020-05-19 00:09:33"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["gregwebs"],"id":[23226409],"kids":{},"parent":[23211068],"text":["This study can lead one to conclude that at least some people can function well for short-term periods of sleep deficit, at least when performing stimulating activities.<p>However, we also have studies showing that people are very poor at recognizing when they are being affected by sleep deficit, so you would need to run this experiment on yourself first before concluding it applies to you!"],"time":["2020-05-18 20:25:52"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["hpoe"],"id":[23226042],"kids":[23232327],"parent":[23211068],"text":["I am fascinated  by this, when I was younger I was obsessed with cutting out sleep, experimenting with polyphasic sleep, energy drinks etc.<p>I&#x27;ll add one other anecdote that I don&#x27;t know what it means, but I had a project I was working on that was tight deadline, as a result I was only able to get two hours a sleep a night for about a week.

Of course, there have been no real studies done on polyphasic sleep and it must be taken on anecdotal evidence alone. However, I don&#x27;t feel any ill effects after a year. My schedule is tamer than others, however; the Everyman 2 consists of a 4.5 hour core sleep and two 20 minute naps [0]. Schedules like Uberman (six 20 minute naps equidistant in time, every 4 hours), Dymaxion, Tesla, and other nap-only sleeps do not seem to be stable, at least for most people who are not genetically mutated to sleep less [1].<p>There are quite some pros as well, such as more time for one; instantly falling asleep (got rid of my insomnia); removal of substances such as alcohol, marijuana, and caffeinated drinks like coffee; and lucid dreams with nearly every sleep. The latter is very useful for me as I can test out ideas in dreams and see how they could fare, a sort of omnipotent virtual reality.<p>As I wrote in another comment, the fact that many think polyphasic sleep is only Uberman or other nap-based schedules with ~2 hour total sleep time is disappointing to see. There are other schedules on that site that are far tamer, such as Everyman 1: sleep 6 hours at night, one 20-min nap during the day, which you could do on a lunch break. There are whole gradations from 9 hours (two 4.5 hour sleeps, not necessarily reduction of total sleep time, but it gives better sleep for some) to Uberman or Tesla (~2 hour total sleep time), which by the way is not known to be stable over a longer time period, a fact that the polyphasic community willingly accepts.<p>It is particularly disappointing to see because, as another commenter said, I&#x27;d like to see more research on sleep and perhaps synthesizing its effects into a compound, but if people dismiss these alternate sleep schedules, we may not fully understand what the brain is doing during sleep, as fewer researchers are incentivized to study it, thinking it&#x27;s just BS, which hurts the field overall.<p>I do wonder though if the main advantages of polyphasic sleep are that it enforces a more rigid structure than monophasic sleep; if you miss a nap, or you oversleep, you&#x27;re done for. If one could enforce the same level of scheduling in monophasic sleep, I wonder if they wouldn&#x27;t have the same advantage of increased time. It&#x27;s too easy to make excuses with monophasic sleep however, saying that you&#x27;ll just sleep after one more drink &#x2F; turn of a game &#x2F; line of code, so polyphasic sleep acts as an enforcer of such a schedule, and here is where its true strength lies.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;polyphasic.net&#x2F;schedules&#x2F;everyman&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;polyphasic.net&#x2F;schedules&#x2F;everyman&#x2F;<\/a><p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nih.gov&#x2F;news-events&#x2F;nih-research-matters&#x2F;gene-identified-people-who-need-little-sleep\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nih.gov&#x2F;news-events&#x2F;nih-research-matters&#x2F;gene-id...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-18 22:56:28"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["sebow"],"id":[23233895],"kids":{},"parent":[23211068],"text":["This is highly subjective and depends from person to person.Da vinci for example had an absolutely insane schedule(something like working 4 hours, sleeping for half an hour and repeat).<p>For stronger, more &quot;effective&quot; sleep hours, exercise is needed ,alongside good oxygen and adequate temperature.This is almost a fact and other factors like caffeine(which slow your brain when you&#x27;re not consuming it) must be considered.<p>All in all, i think most people forget to &quot;debug&quot; themselves and the needs of their bodies by being pressured by time &amp; career.

Even going to bed a bit too late is much less of an issue ;-)<p>- When I wake up around 06:00, I reward myself with a morning run (I love running), no one is out on the streets at 6 AM where I&#x27;m from.<p>I am now experimenting with using my positive momentum to get into full workout&#x2F;stretching routines.<p>I really like the idea of acquainting myself with topics by having a simple place (shower, living room) and trigger response (end of shower, leaving the living room). I thought of it myself, I never heard anyone about it. And it feels quite unlike doing a &quot;30 day experiment&quot;, because I am actively looking for the fun of it.<p>I hope it works. I got inspired by it by reading Atomic Habits by James Clear.<p>Everyone has their own system as the author said, so I&#x27;d encourage more of us share our systems. As having more systems to read from might be more inspiring to some procrastinators to take action and experiment.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.verywellfit.com&#x2F;thmb&#x2F;gliK2-_bmUZk-YpGJRua9YSEtTk=&#x2F;1500x1000&#x2F;filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()&#x2F;StandingHamstringStrethBothLegsAtOnce2-d6fde12460994b968dc65e63f5fa4dc6.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.verywellfit.com&#x2F;thmb&#x2F;gliK2-_bmUZk-YpGJRua9YSEtTk...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-18 22:18:32"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["hnick"],"id":[23230612],"kids":{},"parent":[23227331],"text":["&gt; Finish every task immediately which takes less than 2 minutes to do<p>OK.<p>&gt; Categorize tasks by project, time, and context, and store it in a tool that you can trust<p>That takes more than 2 minutes :(<p>Occasionally I&#x27;ll start a todo list, but usually I just stop using it because it gets too big and scary.

Rituals. &quot;OCD&quot; like rules. These rules are born out of personal pain, trauma and disappointment with myself. Stupid Rules that I must follow even when it doesn&#x27;t make any sense to follow. Inviolable rules. Unbreakable rules.<p>Here is how a rule is born. Be natural and live your life without any rules. Whenever you screwup and feel a deep emotional sense of failure you create a permanent rule that lasts for ever as long as you live. The beauty about this approach is that the Pareto principle kicks in. 90% of your screw-ups come from 10% of causes. As you start integrating rules into your life your life becomes dramatically better. Your mind doesn&#x27;t care about intentions. It understands intentions but it bypasses them. Your mind doesn&#x27;t care about rules that you import from other people. It doesn&#x27;t care about rules that are not deeply connected to your personal experience.  If you find yourself violating rules repeatedly you must discard them for they are not for you at this stage of your life.<p>There is only one key insight regarding procrastination for me.<p>Procrastination only occurs when there is something else more important that is in a &quot;live&quot; state in the background. Procrastination is like the branch of a tree. The trunk is the main task.<p>If you get rid of the trunk the branch cannot exist. This was the key insight for me.<p>The only reason you are browsing HN or Reddit or Facebook is because you have something else in the other tabs that you are not doing actively.<p>For example: You need to work on your PhD thesis. You have it open in one tab. This gives your mind the permission to procrastinate via HN&#x2F;FB or watch motivational videos without feeling guilty.<p>So, if you install a tab limiter and limit yourself to one tab or two tabs where the second tab is for listening to music, you will be forced to close the &quot;work&quot; tab. Now you won&#x27;t enjoy reading HN or FB anymore because you are consciously not &quot;working&quot; on anything else.<p>Coming back to RULES.<p>I frequently run out of gas and then I panic and reach the gas station just in the nick of time. I find this very annoying. I hate the feeling of the anxiety because it is self inflicted.<p>The rule that I created is that I must always (regardless of the circumstance) as soon as the fuel reaches below 20%. I have to get it to 100%. There are no exceptions.<p>After I created this rule, I never ever ever encountered a situation where I was running out of gas.<p>For a normal person this seems very unimportant and ridiculous. And it is. But for me I feel great joy and happiness because I know I avoided so much personal pain and anxiety just with this one simple rule.<p>Coming back to conquering procrastination.<p>The way my mind works is that it will at any moment ALWAYS choose the most interesting option of the available options automatically. And I don&#x27;t really have any control over my mind. I can&#x27;t tell it to focus any more than you can you tell a husky or a raccoon or a wild monkey how to behave properly. This is something you need to respect and understand.<p>Strangely, my mind follows rules without any issue. These rules must be formed out of personal experience and must come from deep within and must be acceptable to my mind ahead of time.<p>This is what I do. I create a ritual that combines two different things: This ritual is unbreakable and it can&#x27;t be reasoned away. I follow this ritual even when it doesn&#x27;t make any sense. Especially if it doesn&#x27;t make any sense because the alternative is this: I will lose my job&#x2F;friends&#x2F;social support&#x2F;money and will end up on the street or worse.<p>So, the choice is really between: a) Following the ritual and choosing life b) Self Destruction or Death.<p>1. Rules + 2. Cutting off the Tree Trunk == Life.<p>So here is how I create my work ritual.<p>There are only two major sources of distraction: 1. Phone 2. Internet.  3. (minor) chatter inside my head.<p>Step 1. Setup constraints.<p>I use the Forest App&#x2F;Flora App to disable my phone for 2 to 3 hours.<p>I use the tab limiter to limit myself to a max of 2 tabs. One for the main task and the second one to LISTEN to Youtube music.<p>Step 2. Rules that are acceptable to my mind.<p>These are the Rules. \na. I can choose to work on the main task. \nb. I can choose to not do the main task and do nothing. \nc. I can choose to not do the main task and listen to music. \nd. I cannot browse on multiple tabs. If I do want to browse HN, I can do so but not within the 2 to 3 hour time window.\ne. There are no restrictions. I can read HN all day. I can watch Netflix all day. I can only not do them in this particular time window.<p>Because I already decided these rules in advance ahead of time  and these rules are born out of personal pain my mind accepts it. Another reason it accepts it is because it is cognizant of the fact that these rules have worked well in the past and I  am building a new track record of success. Past success breeds more self confidence regarding future success.<p>Coming back to the most interesting option theory. My mind always chooses the most interesting option out of available options.<p>So, lets say I want to do my taxes today. This is work. Which means it triggers ritual in my mind. I don&#x27;t work without a ritual and that&#x27;s the rule.<p>I create a 2 hour major window which contains the above mentioned rules. Because the option to browse HN&#x2F;FB is not there my mind has a choice of choosing between doing nothing or doing taxes. Doing taxes is very boring but only when compared to reading HN. Once my mind realizes that the only options are doing nothing or doing taxes it will choose doing taxes delightfully.<p>And here is one final key: The 2 to 3 hour window seems big but 2 to 3 hours passes by quickly like a few mins. And when you realize you are getting things done you will be filled with happiness, joy and accomplishment because you KNOW how miserable you felt when you procrastinated on things and achieved nothing.<p>The 2 to 3 hour window is a major window. And within this major window you have minor Pomodoros. You spend 5 mins creating a precise 30 mins action plan and you start your pomodoro. Even if you are distracted it is fine but how will you get distracted and by what? Your phone is disabled and you only have 1 tab. You will be distracted by your internal chatter which is an issue but you will be massively more productive and much happier when you compare yourself to your past self.<p>This HN Story was posted 11 hours ago. I am only posting a response now. Why? I was working within a Time Window of 5 hours that blocked out my use of HN.<p>If you struggle with ADHD or procrastination I urge to try creating rules and see how your life changes for the better. I seems very stupid and obvious but it worked really well for me."],"time":["2020-05-19 08:45:12"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mehdix"],"id":[23232278],"kids":[23232531],"parent":[23227331],"text":["I used to maintain a zero inbox, until I read an article by the author of the technique (apologies for not remembering the source) that my mailbox is a TODO list that anyone can put an item on that.

Couchsurfing has been one of the most important things in my life, so I&#x27;ll do my best to explain why it&#x27;s so special.<p>The basic idea is you stay at a stranger&#x27;s place, or you host a stranger at yours - completely for free, no money involved. Everyone does it differently. Some people plan their trip meticulously months in advance and give arrival times to the minute, while others send a message at 9pm the same night asking if you&#x27;re free. Some people ask to stay one night, some three, some far more; some bring bags of delicious food and artwork of their culture and some bring nothing.<p>I mostly host, and I&#x27;ve had all of the above - and then some. You have an incredibly diverse group of people. I&#x27;ve met artists, musicians, dancers - everyone from a Syrian man who lived under ISIS for years to an evangelical Christian woman who wanted to try shrooms.<p>The beautiful thing is that it&#x27;s anything you want it to be. People have profiles that are often filled out with a good amount of detail (I usually skip the skimpy profiles) so you can pick out whoever or whatever you want. You want a pastry chef? You want a violinist? You want an architect? You want someone tidy and on-time or a hitchhiking hippie? Simply search for one to host or stay with.<p>The friendships and relationships I&#x27;ve made through Couchsurfing have been some of the best and most interesting I could have asked for. And the best part - you can do it all from home, traveling the world from the comfort of your couch.<p>Anyway, that&#x27;s the beauty of it. I really hope that the network of people can be saved. Long term, I think it can, with something like BeWelcome, but of course it&#x27;s a network effect problem - no hosts=no guests.<p>If anyone is curious about Couchsurfing (or wants to couchsurf my boat in the Netherlands - seriously, anyone is welcome, please come!) then feel free to send me an email (it&#x27;s in my profile.)"],"time":["2020-05-18 03:16:46"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["MattGaiser"],"id":[23216799],"kids":[23217771,23216842,23217102],"parent":[23211495],"text":["&gt;If community powered websites like Reddit can survive<p>Reddit is backed by venture capital and shifted heavily to be more advertiser friendly."],"time":["2020-05-18 02:15:52"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["PopeDotNinja"],"id":[23219537],"kids":[23221971],"parent":[23211495],"text":["Couchsurfing, I love you, but y&#x27;all have a horrible business model.<p>Between 2017 &amp; 2019, I hosted about Couchsurfers.

One of the things that made it work was profile reviews and couch requests. The second thing was the community forums.<p>The profile reviews and couch requests acted as a quality filter. Bad reviews lead to much lower community engagement. An interesting profile and good reviews, combined with community instruction on how to compose a good request, leads to acceptance of couch requests. The system works as long as the community polices itself, teaches its values to new members, and encourages good behavior.<p>The community forums were a huge part of facilitating all that. Profiles would often include instructions on how to behave, but the forums filled the gaps by adding social pressure to enforce standard conventions. They also ensured there was constant user engagement and content, which we know from modern social media sites is imperative for a vibrant community.<p>All of that got flushed down the drain when Couchsurfing reorganized and annihilated their old site. All the community engagement fled to private Facebook groups. That caused profile quality to crash, and the result is anti-community behavior, like how the majority of single men on the platform now host only single women, which besides being sketch as hell, just makes it harder to find a reliable host.<p>After I literally flew across the country just to have lunch with the Couchsurfing team and discuss the community problems I&#x27;d collected, I got the impression that they were not going to change. My concerns were mostly considered bug reports, and the problems that drove the community away were never addressed. Years later, it looks like no work has been done at all.<p>I was grandfathered in as an older user so I never even realized they started charged you to send more than a certain number of couch requests. But why would any new user seriously commit to a community <i>now<\/i>? It can probably still be a place to meet amazing people, but you can also just meet amazing people anywhere you go in the world, without Couchsurfing.<p>The saddest part of all of this is that now there won&#x27;t be an amazing platform to show people how insanely generous humans are all over the world. Hopefully BeWelcome or another site can pick up the mantle and restore the old ways, so we can go back to showing more people the inherent goodness of strangers - when those strangers are tied together via community and purpose."],"time":["2020-05-18 07:51:57"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["teruakohatu"],"id":[23217027],"kids":[23218745,23217129],"parent":[23211495],"text":["Couch surfing is not dead.

By definition. Meeting people is a huge value add, and the longer you stay on the platform, the more you gravitate toward the &quot;community spirit&quot; and less &quot;saving money&quot; side of things. But you are kidding yourself if you think that first time CS users are on the platform for any other reason than squeezing a few more days out of a thin backpacking budget.<p>Not only are they broke, but even the community often has an anti-money ethos. Just look at the outrage (as the article points out) when they switched to a B corporation. And it makes sense -- taking an inherently capitalist product (lodging) and building a community to make it free creates a very specific narrative.<p>Therefore, the expectation that CS users, especially first-time, will pay even a dollar on the service is DOA. They need to make money (exactly how much is up for debate), but this isn&#x27;t the way to do it.<p>But that doesn&#x27;t mean there aren&#x27;t any other choices! CS Event sponsorships, cross-product integration (language learning, travel deals FFS), other corporate sponsorships, a more Airbnb-like private experience (maybe the community would hate that too, who knows), partnerships with local tourism authorities, discounted tour &#x2F; event packages... None of these were even close to tried.<p>I&#x27;m not at all advocating that Couchsurfing should have become Tripadvisor, but to barely even consider a few alternatives to nickel and diming a bunch of broke backpackers just shows that CS was on its way out long before COVID-19..."],"time":["2020-05-18 02:29:02"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["vvpan"],"id":[23217198],"kids":[23217472],"parent":[23211495],"text":["An aside: Why does Medium add a login wall to some articles?

It&#x27;s a manually managed piece of memory, and (IMO) the system would have been much better off if it were actually a cache rather than having to load an entire texture in regardless of what was being sampled.  Nowhere I&#x27;ve seen in Nintendo&#x27;s literature do they call it a cache either.  The crazy hacks that Rare did to subdivide their geometry on texture boundaries wouldn&#x27;t be necessary for instance.  I&#x27;d maybe even be into a 2KB cache over a 4KB chunk of manually managed memory.<p>One other aside is that I think the system still has tons of unlocked potential.  So much of unlocking it&#x27;s power seems to be centered around memory bank utilization.  Switching which page of DRAM within a bank is expensive in terms of latency, but it seems like if you allocate your memory in 1MB bank chunks you can get around a lot of the limitations of the systems having the slow memory that developers complained about at the time.  I don&#x27;t blame developers at the time, they were coming from SNES where it was single cycle access to RAM, to the N64 that had a very deep, very modern memory hierarchy  and what all that means for your code.  The industry as a whole didn&#x27;t really catch on until about halfway through the PS2&#x27;s development cycle.  But applying some of those PS2 techniques back, the system really purrs when you have dedicate a 1MB bank to each streaming source or destination.  I can&#x27;t wait to see what crazy stuff happens when the demoscene folk really start to get their hands dirty with it."],"time":["2020-05-19 01:08:45"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["twic"],"id":[23227224],"kids":[23229618],"parent":[23224840],"text":["One of my favourite little easter eggs in Goldeneye is that during the Silo mission, two of the satellite components you have to steal are the N64&#x27;s RSP and RDP:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;007goldeneye25&#x2F;status&#x2F;1098294154919071745\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;007goldeneye25&#x2F;status&#x2F;109829415491907174...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-18 21:25:36"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["r0bbbo"],"id":[23225430],"kids":[23226264,23226363],"parent":[23224840],"text":["For someone just starting to learn about computer architecture at a low level (rather embarrassing for someone who&#x27;s been in the industry for over a decade), this is a really interesting read, and it&#x27;s helping concepts like pipelining and caching to gel."],"time":["2020-05-18 19:25:43"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["castratikron"],"id":[23226731],"kids":{},"parent":[23224840],"text":["Someone made a pin-compatible Controller Pak with FRAM that doesn&#x27;t require a battery.

They make dubious claims and effectively sabotage their own application (more on that below).<p>The solution to Android 10 problems — a software wrapper called &quot;proot&quot; [1] — has already been found. That solution would allow to keep all of Termux functionality and preserve existing package managers (such as apt). Proot allows Android user to compile C code in Termux (which they currently can do) and does not require major changes to Termux itself.<p>Termux developers refused to adopt proot as solution and even removed it&#x27;s mention from their wiki on Github. Instead they are insisting that all Termux packages should be distributed in Android apk files, published on Google Play. That &quot;solution&quot; has major usability issues, does not scale (it uses shoddy Android PackageManager to track all Termux packages) and would prevent users from using Gcc and other compilers in Termux. The only claimed upside of using apk files is that it would better comply with Google&#x27;s policies.<p>Termux developers justify their actions by following arguments:<p>1. Termux packages require a lot of bandwidth to host, and Termux does not have money to pay for their mirrors; hosting packages in Google Play would be preferable. That statement is nonsense — even fringe Linux distributions like Artix can find FREE mirrors, willing to host their packages. This is usually done by contacting curators of existing servers, that host Linux packages, and asking them for support. Termux is more popular than some of Linux distributions, but it does not look like Termux devs even TRY to do that — they apparently just sit on their hands, occasionally begging their sole mirror provider (JFrog) for more bandwidth.<p>2. Termux currently does not comply with Google&#x27;s policy and it&#x27;s developers are afraid, that this will result in removal from Google Play. They are technically right, but they are making mistake by downgrading experience of their app in attempt to pacify Google Play censors.

I see a new wave of iPhone&#x2F;Android apps, WhatsApp&#x2F;Twitter official accounts, etc. creating the same monopolistic synergy where the government decides what apps the citizens have to install and what Operating Systems to use. The abuse of monopolies is not fight against but government officials take sides and choose which monopolies to grow.<p>Finally, a point missed in the comments: WhatsApp is an American company. The misalignment between Europe and the USA has grown the recent years meanwhile the technological dependence of Europe towards the USA has increased. That will not end well. The USA is in a position to shutdown all the technological infrastructure of Europe (AWS, Google, Facebook, Azure, ...) and to openly spy its citizens. When the two blocks were in more friendly terms that was seen as acceptable, today that is creating an uneasy feeling.<p>As an European citizen I do not feel safe with such an American oversight of my private and job-related activities. And, this is the most important point, when citizens feel threatened they will react or over-react to the situation. The USA has not been a trustworthy partner for some time. And ,the rise of TikTok and other Chinese apps are bringing that fear to public attention.<p>The solution is trivially easy and has existed for long: open standards. Mail has been around as long as the Internet and proven its value, the same applies to the World Wide Web. The only reason for the rise of apps is that companies see them as a good way of lock-in customers, gather data and increase influence. All that reasons are bad for the economy, for the freedom of countries and individuals. Open standards should be pushed as a leveling field for competing companies, as a form to increase freedom of expressions and communication and to avoid single-points-of-faiulre that risk big parts of the economy.<p>I hope for a return to sanity and open standards.

You are always compromising on something.<p>Uneducated users just use what everybody else uses that is &quot;free&quot;. This tends to be stuff that is provided by big US based companies like Google, Facebook, Apple, etc. Free here is primarily about pricing and convenience. Recently, people value encryption a bit more but most users lack the expertise to make good decisions for this. So, they&#x27;ll use something that supports encryption without realizing that might need configuration or turning on.<p>Companies have to deal with employees using non-sanctioned devices and solutions (i.e. uneducated users), which means the above tools are used. Additionally, they tend to have internal tools that are required to used for internal communication. Typically these too are provided by big US based companies (Slack, Microsoft, Facebook, Google) but are optimized for corporate requirements (better security, team features). A problem with these tools is that they are useless for communicating with people outside the company. Most companies are part of a complex supply chain involving companies that typically don&#x27;t align on this. So, things like Skype, Google Meets, Zoom, etc. are popular in this space. Or email. A surprising amount of communication still happens via unencrypted email.<p>Finally, educated users tend to pick solutions that are a bit more on the paranoid side of the spectrum when it comes to privacy, encryption, data ownership, etc. Additionally, open source clients and servers are important in this space. Signal, Matrix, etc. are some better known solutions in this space. Unfortunately, these solutions tend to be not widely adopted and make it harder to communicate with &quot;normal&quot; people in the above two groups. I have signal on my phone but less than 99% of my phone book actually is reachable via it (not counting sms messages here for obvious reasons).<p>Companies are increasingly valuing this type of solutions from a security point of view. Industrial espionage is a thing and it&#x27;s a thing companies with representatives in countries like China, Russia, or even the US have to worry about. These countries have very active intelligence agencies and a long track record of actively serving local businesses with basically any information they can get their hands on. Therefore companies that care about keeping secrets ought to be highly paranoid about popular solutions controlled by US incs that must be assumed to be actively under the attention of intelligence agencies.<p>IMHO OSS, federated solutions, with multiple implementations, clients, and no central control is what is needed. Unfortunately the dominant business models in this space favour closed source, non federated solutions with maybe some OSS clients but typically no independent server side implementations. Signal and matrix are exceptions in this space and neither has meaningful (&gt; 1%) traction in the any market. I guess matrix is growing nicely regardless. Also signal has one big flaw: it uses phone numbers for authorizing users. This gives a large amount of control to operators."],"time":["2020-05-18 13:32:02"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["captainmuon"],"id":[23219655],"kids":[23219803,23219848,23219737,23219775,23219920,23219752,23219802],"parent":[23217326],"text":["Generally I&#x27;m for stronger data protection, but German officials relationship to WhatsApp is a bit silly, I always wonder what their conrete worry or attack scenario is.

Tech investment in general was over saturated.<p>I was predicting last April (2019) that we would be heading into recession within 18-24 months even though we were in the strongest and longest running bear market in history. I wasn’t the only one predicting this as I was seeing several vaguely similar comments here on HN. I had no idea there would be a pandemic, a depression, or that any of it would happen within a year. Investments crashed earlier and harder that I anticipated because the cause of the crash was something I never thought of, but the reaction and result are similar.<p>The reason why people were predicting a recession is that there was&#x2F;is too much money tied to investment speculation that isn’t reflected in the revenue of a given organization. In more plain terms people were betting on growth even though growth alone couldn’t repay the investments at present, which looks like a Ponzi scheme. The idea of a Ponzi scheme is to bet on growth and then encourage additional layers of investment to drive up the value of the prior layers and then dump it before it implodes, like a game musical chairs. Here are some basic examples:<p>* Uber was a $60 billion unicorn. It was loosing billions every quarter though without any profit in sight and yet people were still investing in it. Now it’s shedding like employees and closing offices.<p>* Amazon is a less extreme and much less obvious example. For one Amazon is profitable, and two Amazon makes money on infrastructure which provides scalable growth. Amazon’s market cap is insane at $1.2 trillion. Amazon generates neither the profit, revenue, sales, or growth to account for anything close to that, which speaks to speculation. As an interesting side note has historically lost money on its retail business and on Prime. It took selling access to its infrastructure to deliver a profit.<p>* For an example of the opposite  Bank of America’s stock tanked as a result of the pandemic but it still reported a very strong first quarter a month later. It looks like the bank will continue to perform well in its earning statements even with consumer mortgage and loan forgiveness due to strengths in other banking segments. It will be curious to watch as last week Berkshire Hathaway started dumping its investments in the banking sector. The most notable are its dumping of Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs that are failing to perform to expectations but it is also the largest single investor in BAC and it is dumping that too. This loss of investments won’t impact current business performance relative to the marketplace in general or to its competitors specifically."],"time":["2020-05-19 00:16:02"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["davefp"],"id":[23228387],"kids":{},"parent":[23225147],"text":["A unicorn with wings is an Alicorn, thank you very much."],"time":["2020-05-18 23:07:57"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["TrackerFF"],"id":[23226520],"kids":{},"parent":[23225147],"text":["lmao, they actually put those pics in their presentation."],"time":["2020-05-18 20:33:14"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ykl"],"id":[23227755],"kids":{},"parent":[23225147],"text":["Metacommentary: Every time I see a Bloomberg link on HN, I cross my fingers that it is Matt Levine, and every time it is in fact Matt Levine, it’s pure gold and 100% worth the click.

The thing with emergent properties is it&#x27;s extremely hard to draw a line where the system that exhibits the property transitions from not exhibiting that property to exhibiting it.<p>Consider a cyclone, a mass of air rotating around a zone of low pressure in the atmosphere. Clearly this is an emergent property of air, or any gas really. But if you statistically analyse any mass of gas you will be able to find volumes where there are regions of lower pressure than the average and the particles nearby will have a (possibly tiny) net angular momentum around that low pressure region. Any volume of gas will have these, but are they cyclones? How long does such a state have to persist to count? How much angular momentum must be present? Must it be on the surface of the earth to count? What about near another similar surface?<p>You can do this with any emergent property, right down to the electrons orbiting a nucleus, does that make them cyclones? The thing is whether you say yes or not, it doesn&#x27;t really matter because it&#x27;s not a useful level of analysis if you want to understand the behaviour or nature of cyclones in global weather forecasting. It&#x27;s a context error.<p>Take the idea that an electron&#x27;s state is not random but chosen, per the article. Well to make a choice implies considering reasons or following a pattern of behaviour. However we can see experimentally that the states of electrons do strictly follow random statistical distributions. So you can argue that their &#x27;nature&#x27; is to &#x27;choose&#x27; a random state, but at this point youre jamming a useless and explanation-free definition on the term &#x27;choose&#x27;.<p>Now don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;m basically a materialist. I believe that my decisions as a free agent are determined by my mental, psychological and essentially neuronal state. I believe this is necessary for me to be considered to have free will, because for _me_ to have free will my decisions must come form me, and I am my state. If my memories, instincts, experiences, knowledge and values don&#x27;t influence or even determine my decisions, then those decisions don&#x27;t come from _me_ in any meaningful sense. I don&#x27;t care if that means my decisions are in principle deterministic, that&#x27;s fine, it just means I&#x27;m a consistent being.<p>So yes my behaviour comes from my state and you could argue that the behaviour of an electron comes from it&#x27;s state, or the behaviour of a gas comes from it&#x27;s state.

The dirty secret of open source is that much of it is powered by maintainer guilt.<p>If you’re looking to make money, I don’t recommend you get into open source. I wish this weren’t the case, but this is the current situation.<p>Unfortunately, it seems the best path if you want to do open source as a career is to do enough open source to get your name out there and then leverage that into a job offer at some megacorp. Maybe you’ll be able to get a role doing open source, but that’s rare. Hopefully you can continue to do open source in your free time at least.<p>That said, if you insist your goal is to get paid doing open source full-time, here are my tips:<p>1. Create a project that is end-user facing. No one is aware of which transitive dependencies they are using, so no matter how useful your software, you’ll struggle to get donations, sponsors, or consulting work unless the end user knows your name. Reliable, error-free transitive dependencies are invisible. Therefore, the maintainers are invisible, too. And, the better these maintainers do their job, the more invisible they are. No one ever visits a GitHub repository for a transitive dependency that works perfectly – there’s no reason to do so. But a developer investigating an error stack trace might visit the repository if for no other reason than to file an issue. At least then there’s a small chance they’ll see the maintainer’s plea in the README. (I wrote more about this here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;feross.org&#x2F;funding-experiment-recap&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;feross.org&#x2F;funding-experiment-recap&#x2F;<\/a>)<p>2. Make sure it’s something that the enterprise cares about. If you build a cool P2P project or a new programming language you’re gonna have a tough time. No matter how useful or innovative the project is. On the other hand, if you’re making a front end framework or a UI library for React or something like that, you’ll have a much better shot at getting companies to sponsor your project.<p>3. Don’t be afraid to ask for money. Contact companies that are using your library and tell them you want them to sponsor your package. One great hack for finding out who is using your package is to open an issue called “Who is using this?” and ask for testimonials or offer to put users’ logos or links in the README under a “Who uses this” section. Lots of developers will out their companies as users of your package if you do this. This gives you a good list of companies to initially reach out to. Without tricks like this it’s impossible to know who’s even using your package. That’s the first to step to finding sponsors."],"time":["2020-05-18 09:42:48"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ukutaht"],"id":[23220380],"kids":[23220459,23220944,23229253],"parent":[23218943],"text":["I&#x27;m working on an open-source web analytics tool over at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;plausible-insights&#x2F;plausible\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;plausible-insights&#x2F;plausible<\/a>.

Somehow we need to think differently about compensating indie OSS projects (code, docs, examples, analytics, slack, community, and cloud services) for their work. Free is not so easy.

We&#x27;ve got all the technology we need already.<p>(The trick is that we have to optimize globally, e.g. things like connecting all the world&#x27;s electric grids into one so that we can shift power around as the planet rotates.  A global grid has greater opportunities for efficiency.)<p>So, from that POV, trying to make a living from somehow selling software is counter-productive.

This is what worked for me:<p>1. University, some time after it. No much obligations. Take low-effort job to sustain yourself (maybe freelance), spend the rest of the time contributing to open source. Treat it as a time to learn. The main goal is to become good. You can learn very different things by contributing to OSS packages, as compared to working for some outdated local company. Try to internalize how popular software is organized, how people review code, etc. Find people you respect, work with them. You don&#x27;t need to have a shiny CV and pass technical interviews to work with great people you can learn from, developing great real-world technology, solving hard problems.<p>2. You need a real job. Try to find one which allows you to spend some time doing Open Source; have it as an important criteria for choosing a job, among salary, work environment, etc.<p>For me two types of companies worked as a &quot;real job&quot; which allows OSS contributions.<p>First, some small startups &#x2F; companies. They often don&#x27;t mind if you open source a few libraries from the codebase you&#x27;ve created, because usually it is not the code itself which is important for startups; they&#x27;re trying to find product-market fit. For them a benefit is that code become organized better (after an idea fails, code can be reused for the next idea), and developers are happier, so it can be win-win. You won&#x27;t be working on open source full time, but you&#x27;ll be able to create something useful, and spend significant amount of time on it.<p>Second, there are companies which are built around open source, or contributing a lot to open source. Often there is a company behind a popular OSS software (e.g. Elasticsearch for Elasticsearch, or Scrapinghub for Scrapy). Sometimes company&#x27;s github has many actively developing OSS projects, which is a good sign. Look for such companies, apply. There is a higher chance to be able to work on open source if you join such company. It is not given you&#x27;ll be allocated to work on OSS, but a previous experience maintaining Open Source and contributing to it helps. That&#x27;s good to be proactive here - use your experience gained from unpaid OSS work or small startup OSS work, start contributing without being asked.<p>According to my experience, working full time, having family and having significant Open Source contributions is very hard, unless an employer supports it, or unless the job is not really a full time job.<p>There are &quot;rockstars&quot; which are able to sustain themselves just by working on their own OSS projects, but I think currently they are outliers, not a norm. It may be possible to do this, but I&#x27;ve personally seen way more opportunities to do sustainable OSS work as a part of day job, as compared to donations or a new business."],"time":["2020-05-18 09:45:16"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["rado"],"id":[23219550],"kids":{},"parent":[23218943],"text":["My OSS project is a satellite to my day job."],"time":["2020-05-18 09:52:33"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["atum47"],"id":[23224385],"kids":{},"parent":[23218943],"text":["I usually support my open source work with my full time job. it&#x27;s not ideal, but it is what it is for now."],"time":["2020-05-18 18:16:17"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["johnthescott"],"id":[23241167],"kids":{},"parent":[23218943],"text":["by moving certain rich clients to open source for HUGE savings.  reps of a few well know software companies turn six shades of fuchsia when i walk into the room."],"time":["2020-05-20 00:42:09"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["robertlagrant"],"id":[23219736],"kids":[23220727],"parent":[23218943],"text":["I notice noone&#x27;s mentioned Tidelift.

It&#x27;s not always easy and sometimes I&#x27;ve questioned my sanity, but it&#x27;s been incredibly rewarding.<p>Here&#x27;s my (extremely shortened) history with FOSS:<p>Between 2005 and 2015 I worked at various small dev shops that built websites based on the open source Python-based Plone CMS (see <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;plone.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;plone.org<\/a>). We would modify Plone via plugins that we would (usually) open source and as I got better I also started working on the core Plone code as well. I also started contributing to various other FOSS Python libraries. Most of this was paid work as part of my day job.<p>In 2013 I started a side-project writing a web-based FOSS XMPP chat client called Converse.js (see <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;conversejs.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;conversejs.org<\/a>). This was purely for fun and I had no monetisation strategy. Over time people started contacting me with requests for paid work and I started to realise I could potentially work on Converse.js full-time. In 2015 I quit my job as Plone dev and started freelancing, trying to work only on Converse.js-related work.<p>Working on Converse.js has been extremely rewarding with diverse challenges. Here are some examples:<p>* Asynchronous frontend JS development that&#x27;s not HTTP-based, but XMPP-based<p>* Designing and creating UI&#x2F;UX for a product that many people use personally and professionally<p>* Developing a plugin system<p>* Developing an extensible API<p>* End-to-end encryption of messages via libsignal<p>* Standardized protocol development of XMPP via the XMPP Standards Foundation<p>* Managing an open source project with multiple technical contributors and many users<p>For a while I took on other jobs to pay the bills, but over time the Converse.js related work became the bulk, and in 2018 I worked the entire year only on projects related to my FOSS chat client.<p>In 2019 I accepted a full-time position at a company that is building out a chat solution based on Converse.js. I made it clear that I want to continue maintaining and running the project and that I want to upstream work into the open source project whenever possible. So far this has worked out very well and I continue writing a lot of FOSS code.<p>Concerning tips on how to start working on FOSS code:<p>* Look for a company that advertises the fact that they write open source code. Lots of smaller dev shops that use FOSS themselves also contribute back. Alternatively, ask the company where you&#x27;re at whether you can open source some of the code you&#x27;re working on.<p>* (Much, much harder, but very rewarding) Start a FOSS side-project and hopefully grow it into a size and scale where other people start to notice and use it. Once enough people use it, you&#x27;ll start getting paid work from the people depending on it."],"time":["2020-05-18 11:31:53"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[23219960],"kids":{},"parent":[23218943],"text":{},"time":["2020-05-18 10:46:08"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":["alexellisuk"],"id":[23219638],"kids":{},"parent":[23218943],"text":["Alex Ellis here - the author of Inlets and OpenFaaS.<p>If you want to work on Open Source as a full-time career, the best option is to find a company that is working on or invested in an OSS project and join that team.<p>Examples: VMware contribute heavily to Kubernetes.

In many ways, it probably aligns the most with the values of open source which you seem to care about, but except for a handful of people, this is clearly unsustainable and a road to sadness. And all the various efforts that I&#x27;ve seen over the last 20 years to &quot;improve&quot; this situation have failed.<p>Solution 2) is pretty popular around here, for obvious reasons. Especially on the &quot;open core&quot; side, it tries to find an equilibrium point between open source and making money. While I&#x27;m sure there are many successful examples, there&#x27;s also a pretty big tension between the two sides on terms of ideals, and they may not define what&#x27;s success the same way. You may not enjoy a successful exit.<p>Which brings the last 2 solutions which are pretty similar. One thing I&#x27;d say is that in general, there&#x27;s a lot of demand for software engineers. Many fields have needs for them (a lot of them outside the software industry) and, to keep this short, you probably have options to find something that you can accept (you may not want to work at Oracle !).<p>In my case, I&#x27;ve been taking care of a macOS screensaver[1] for a couple of years now. Since I didn&#x27;t start the project, I&#x27;ve always felt bad about asking for donations, but a few users insisted, so I&#x27;ve added a small donate button. Despite the stars and downloads, the donations are far from even covering my expresso addiction ;)<p>But I never expected otherwise. And sure, I could make the donation thing more prominent, some may even say put a button in the preference panel of the screensaver. I&#x27;m not sure it would move the needle by that much, and it&#x27;s probably not worth the extra guilt I&#x27;d feel about asking for those.<p>So in my case, I do freelance engineering jobs, surprisingly completely unrelated to the insanely niche field of macOS screensavers ! I also try to work on (unrelated) iOS apps for myself, although my expectations on that are mild, it&#x27;s not an easy path.<p>But I do have control of my time, and I enjoy being able to keep adding new features to Aerial (there&#x27;s weather in the latest betas !), although that effort tends to come in bursts depending on my free time.

However, that effort is still dependent on U.S. technologies,” said Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross.  “This is not how a responsible global corporate citizen behaves.  We must amend our rules exploited by Huawei and HiSilicon and prevent U.S. technologies from enabling malign activities contrary to U.S. national security and foreign policy interests.”<p>What? You just tried to bankrupt company by cutting off all of their suppliers and partners of business. Of course they will try to survive by trying to self-reliant. The company employs 100,000 people, is super important to the local economy and employment in the shenzhen area, and has over 50% of the shares in China&#x27;s entire core internet infrastructure. If Huawei does not get the supply it needs, it cannot serve the entire China&#x27;s core internet, do you know how much danger that causes to China&#x27;s communication infrastructure security? How much economic damage to the country it&#x27;s going to be? This actually directly harms China&#x27;s national security. Whereas the US claims Huawei harms its national security, when Huawei is not even in the US. When Huawei gets killed off, how do you tell the workers of Huawei and their families, that their livelihood is gone because by its killed of by you, which is a foreign government to them. Are you sure you can deal with the anti-American sentiment afterwards. There is a saying in Chinese &quot;cut of the way someone earns money is equal to killing their parents&quot; (<U+65AD><U+4EBA><U+8D22><U+8DEF><U+5982><U+6740><U+4EBA><U+7236><U+6BCD>)You also know that the average Chinese person is super proud of Huawei as a brand right?<p>This rule change effectively forces all companies in the world that is in the semiconductor industry to abide by US governments wishes. TSMC 7nm processes has less then 10% of US IP and technology. It was developed by Taiwan people with TSMC own investment. But they invariably could use a technology that is in the ERA. Hell, Intel processors is one, and god forbid if the production line has a computer that contains Intel chips. You could argue that this Intel chip assisted in producing Huawei&#x27;s chip no? Where do you draw the line? The US government can just decide how to enforce this based on their feelings of the day? Are you sure this the standard for international justice?<p>For alleged IP infringement against Huawei, get the evidence and sue the company at court. I am all for it, as long as there is trial. So far there are two cases IP infringement cases that I know of, 1 in 2003 with Cisco that settled out of court. 2 with T-mobile in 2013 with regarding a phone testing arm. But Huawei&#x27;s main business is base bands, routers, and consumer electronics. By the way, Ercission has cross licence agreement with Huawei to access Huawei&#x27;s 5G patents. Huawei has many invention patents in 5G, that is recognized globally. I don&#x27;t get where the theft of IP comes from that warrant the company to be killed off.<p>For security issues. Let the market decide, let the customer decide. Customer should be able to make a comprehensive product selection process based on their needs. And if the market says no to Huawei, then Huawei is dead. But let the market decide. US companies can also compete with Huawei, and say they are more secure. Huawei sucks. That is all fine. And I am also fine with the US government producing security assessments on Huawei, and telling every country on earth to not use Huawei equipment. That is US government&#x27;s right. But at least the customer can decide for themselves if Huawei is worth anything. If Huawei is dead because of that, then sure. Its all fair and square. The US can also form alliances with other countries and make sure the country ban Huawei equipment in their countries too. That is the US right too. There are so many ways to compete with Huawei.<p>US gov&#x27;s action is as if, China ordered that every country in the world shall not do business with Microsoft, and forces Microsoft to go bankrupt right now. Imagine if the Microsoft cloud and office365 stops running because of that. US would probably sent warplanes to China by then.<p>Huawei&#x27;s 4G technology worked really well for China&#x27;s environment and was affordable for mass development. It is key enabler in allowing the country to deploy 4G to almost everywhere in China, even the remote villages. This enabled everyone with smartphone to use the internet. And as result, services like mobile payment, shopping, gaming all flourished in China. It in turns create a massive cellphone market in China. Apple, Qualcomn, Xllinx, and host of consumer product providers, or Huawei&#x27;s US suppliers all benefited from this. Competitions in the phone space also pushed the innovation and pricing for smart phones. Huawei was one of the first to push smartphone camera quality and added multi-focal lengths to phones. It pushed Apple and Samsung to innovate on cameras too, look at where smartphone photography has become. I believe US and Chinese technology companies can work together in their respective markets, to make technology more useful, enrich the economy, and make people&#x27;s lives better. Its not a zero sum game. But the US government is viewing it as such. If US wants to win, China must lose.<p>With the US government essentially taking the world&#x27;s companies into hostage in killing off Huawei, I am not sure if US Gov is being a responsible world citizen."],"time":["2020-05-19 03:17:37"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["augustt"],"id":[23218556],"kids":[23218705,23218645],"parent":[23218263],"text":["Wow.

Even if maybe option B is very slightly better, clarity that we&#x27;re all doing A is arguably better than some do A and some B and all suffer.<p>Unicode &#x2F; ISO 10646-1 is an example like that. Some people don&#x27;t like Han Unification, some people think UTF-16 reserved codepoints is an abomination, but mostly everybody is happy to live in a world where Unicode and ISO-10646 are effectively the same thing seen from different angles, not competing standards (Yes that could have happened)<p>Other times though there is no single entity powerful enough and willing to insist on one way forward, and no natural agreement on whether to do A or B. Instead parties that want to do A, and parties that want to do B just agree either is fine. The result is &quot;standards&quot; like USB Storage, TIFF or DICOM that leave far too much as unresolved choices.<p>Example: Some scanner manufacturers agreeing TIFF had designed scanners that start from the top-left of the eventual document, others started top-right or even bottom-right. If TIFF said &quot;Images are top-to-bottom&quot; the bottom-right scanners become expensive because they need a huge RAM buffer. Vice versa if TIFF says &quot;Images are bottom-to-top&quot;. So... the actual TIFF standard says either can be true, you just flip a tag in the header to declare which way up the image is. Decoders have to carry all the burden of dealing with this, or be incompatible with some images to the confusion of users. (&quot;Why is this picture upside down?&quot;)<p>These standards are marginally better than nobody agreeing anything, but only marginally.

If you want a healthy society and to ensure that your next generation: is healthy, has more opportunities to climb the ladder, lower crime rates (more healthy home environments), etc, then you want parental leave.<p>I don&#x27;t think anyone on the left disagrees. But I don&#x27;t understand why the right shouldn&#x27;t. These things also make a lot of economic sense. It is like a mutual fund where we&#x27;re investing in our next generation. Returns are even proportional to your investment. If you&#x27;re wealthy you&#x27;re likely to either own a business or stocks (or both!).

That is to say, selling at a loss to drive down prices and then raising them once you&#x27;ve put your competitors out of business is only illegal in the last step -- the undercutting is not an issue. It should be -- the very act of anti-competitive behavior, like driving out competition or putting up barriers to competition in the form of uneconomic pricing, is written right into the text of the laws. But consumers are helped by low prices, and once the competitors are gone, who is going to say whether the prices are better or worse than they should be; there&#x27;s no benchmark.<p>The main problem with this viewpoint in my mind is that this is clearly unworkable -- a continuous pump-and-dump can&#x27;t work; eventually it has to come crashing down. Arguably it is now crashing down, so that&#x27;s fair, but historically we still have things like Amazon in the digital world, not to mention the traditional big-box retailers that have driven out anything resembling competition.<p>So do we need to have a working anti-trust regime in order to counteract this? Or will such monopolies naturally fail if they are exposed to external stresses? In some ways that depends on the theory of why we are seeing this happen; why there hasn&#x27;t been a huge undercutting of these companies. Or maybe the problem is just that we&#x27;re looking at the wrong timescale; and given long enough these will collapse under the weight of new entrants in to their markets.<p>One theory is that regulatory capture is the root of it; that once you have established your market position by burning money, you can then start spending money on codifying your business practices as the required standard for all competitors. Regulators like to deal with fewer entities rather than more, so the hobgoblin of a foolish consistency start to overwhelm more common-sense ideas in the space.<p>Another is that the power dynamics shift and allow you to treat government as your protector; on the state and local level looking for special treatment (tax advantages, preferential zoning), at the federal level sometimes even direct protection or pork barrel spending or even just being able to influence tax policy.<p>Another theory is that once you are large enough, the various tax and money-moving games that aren&#x27;t worth it for small companies start to scale up; it costs you a million to legally hide or disguise your profits, so until you are looking at revenues at that scale you&#x27;re screwed, so getting over the next size hurdle is the only thing you can focus on.<p>Some might say that this is just a consequence of corporate person-hood and limitation of liability; that in the desire to ensure that corporations pay taxes, we accidentally tacked on too much power by treating them as entities rather than collectives, and all such entities are intrinsically psycopathic.<p>The last theory, and the one that I most dislike (though it may well be true) is that this is just where capitalism ends up if you allow it to grow unfettered; r &gt; g, and all that jazz.<p>I don&#x27;t find any of these 100% convincing, though."],"time":["2020-05-18 23:38:23"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["kingosticks"],"id":[23228612],"kids":[23228762,23229159,23230404,23229353,23229578],"parent":[23228426],"text":["Giving zero days notice to your 3rd-party developers is one way to anger a relatively powerful bunch of your users.

The rationale is clear: Strava needs to achieve profitability. They&#x27;ve been around for over 10 years and have completed 6 rounds of fundraising. They see three paths to profitability: 1) ads, 2) sell user data, 3) subscriptions. They&#x27;re all in on option #3.<p>The biggest challenge they face with subscriptions, as mentioned by other posters, is that the majority of features that users want are available in the free tier. Most of the subscribers I know (myself included) pay the subscription fee because they want to see the platform survive, not because the subscription tier is dramatically better than free. This model works for non-profits (kind of), but probably doesn&#x27;t work for a company sitting on $42M in venture funding.<p>Therefore, they quickly need to a) make the subscription tier much better than free to pull free users over and&#x2F;or b) pull free tier features behind the paywall. Both are very challenging. If &#x27;a&#x27; was easy, you&#x27;d think they would have done it years ago.
