He then argues that the real problem designers and devs are trying to solve is the loss of control - that the browser controls loading, and the blank screen is &quot;bad.&quot;<p>He then says that the solution is using an iframe (called a portal.) which looks to be a proposed API. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.dev&#x2F;hands-on-portals&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.dev&#x2F;hands-on-portals&#x2F;<\/a> - this is available as an origin trial in Chrome 85.<p>So, he&#x27;s saying that SPAs are bad and we should invest in a Chrome-only feature or future feature that might make it through standards?

Portals would be useful here.<p>But it gets to the real problem: client side rendering in the past decade has had a lot more thought and effort in tooling, tutorials, and patterns on the client side than server side, especially with mixed mode. (Mixed mode: adding javascript on top of server-side rendering.) The problem is that server-side rendering and mixed mode is not a good development experience. The back button was never a fully solved problem and POST-redirect-GET is essentially an insufficient hack.<p>If someone wants to talk about making server side rendering for web applications a viable experience, we are likely going to need changes to the standards and we will need to build up a great set of tooling to solve the problem.

Jump to a new section, and the scroll position in the ToC is lost.<p>He describes how to use a portal to fix this.<p>Compare with desktop GUI toolkits. The ToC would be its own element (GtkListView or QtWhateverList or NSThisNThat). The contents would be their own element (GtkTextView or QtCanvas or whatever). Both are drawn independently of the other. You can call for an invalidation of part of the window. You do not need to consider them part of a single window rectangle that will always be redrawn in-toto for a page load.<p>Now, my (weak) understanding of why we&#x27;ve ended up with things like React is that in part they are an attempt to solve this by effectively creating the equivalent of a widget heirarchy inside the browser.

Amazing to launch after years of work.<p>Computers are fantastic things because they allow you to leverage much more evidence when making decisions than would otherwise be possible. It is possible to write computer programs that automate the ingestion and analysis of unimaginably large quantities of data.<p>If the data is well chosen, it is almost always the case that computational analysis reveals new and surprising insights simply because it incorporates more evidence than could possibly be captured by a human brain.<p>And because the universe is chaotic and there are combinatorial explosions of possibilities all over the place, evidence is always better than intuition when seeking insight.<p>As anybody who has grappled with computers and large quantities of data will know, it’s not as simple as that. The joy of analysis and insight is often crushed beneath a mountain of tedious data sourcing, preparation, management and cleaning tasks - ugly ETL scripts that are a horror to maintain and the double horror of trying to extract data with unknown character encodings from undocumented legacy systems - CP-1252 and its friends.<p>It shouldn’t be like this; it doesn’t have to be like this. Computers should be able to do most of this for us. It makes no sense that we are still writing the same simple and tedious data validation and transformation programs over and over ad infinitum. There must be a better way.<p>This is the problem that we set out to solve with TerminusDB. We identified two absolutely indispensable characteristics that were currently sorely lacking in data management tools.<p>The first one was a rich and universally machine-interpretable modeling language. If we want computers to be able to transform data between different representations automatically, they need to be able to describe their data models to one another.<p>The second major missing requirement is effective revision control. Revision control technologies have been instrumental in turning software production from a craft to an engineering discipline because they make collaboration and coordination between large groups much more fault tolerant - and boy humans produce faults. The need for such capabilities is screamingly obvious when dealing with data - where the existence of multiple versions of the same underlying dataset is almost ubiquitous and with only the most primitive tool support.<p>In October 2019, we released version 1.0 of TerminusDB - it contained the culmination of 4 years of building out the data modeling capacity that we needed - the W3Cs web ontology language with a closed world interpretation.<p>We chose this solution firstly because OWL is by far the best thing humanity has yet produced in terms of a rich, machine-interpretable data modeling interchange format. It is essentially first-order logic with set operations - when it comes to platform interoperability nothing beats mathematics! And adding a closed world interpretation to OWL turns out to be surprisingly easy and semantically unproblematic (closed worlds are contained within open worlds).<p>In January 2020 with version 1.1. we released the first version of our immutable revision control storage layer - with many of the ideas shamelessly borrowed from git, but expanded significantly because when dealing with data, you need to distinguish between things like schema and instance data and keep them aligned. It turns out to require a significantly more complex structure of internal pointers, but it can be done!<p>In June 2020, we release version 2.0 - this included the revision control API - push, pull, branch and merge fully integrated with the database, query, and modeling engine. At this stage the database itself was more or less complete in terms of features, but there was one more critical and important point before we could say we had managed to deliver on our vision.<p>With distributed collaboration technology there is always a bootstrapping problem - it’s no use having technology that allows you to collaborate on data in a peer-to-peer decentralized way unless there are other people out there to connect to and collaborate with. To overcome that problem, we needed to deliver an infrastructure that would allow people to get started, to share and find data and collaborators.<p>Today we release TerminusDB version 3.0 and at the same time we open the doors of TerminusHub. The database is now fully integrated with the hub, allowing all TerminusDB users to share, store, publish and collaborate on databases with other users and do so at the grand price of free. With this release, I think we can say that we have a product that delivers on our vision.<p>The product itself is only a means to an end. We built TerminusDB to take away the pain of building amazing evidence bases for computational analysis. Although we will relentlessly continue to focus on product and remove every pain point that shows up, we now have the type of tool that we wanted. Now we are going to build some truly wonderful data resources."],"time":["2020-09-08 17:26:48"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Naac"],"id":[24412863],"kids":[24413093,24417884],"parent":[24409334],"text":["Are you using a self-signed cert?<p>I&#x27;m getting a &quot;Warning: Potential Security Risk Ahead&quot; from Firefox."],"time":["2020-09-08 22:25:54"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["pfdietz"],"id":[24404652],"kids":[24419739],"parent":[24398048],"text":["This reminds me a bit of quadrupole ion (Paul) traps.<p>These confine charged particles using just electric fields.

There&#x27;s cool stuff like how picking up a digital mushroom results in a real world speed boost. It&#x27;s super fun looking. Definitely just a toy, but I think this is closer to a successful model of AR than most of the stuff people have made so far. Looking at stuff through a phone like a window is a terrible UI. Glasses are hard to make comfy, fashionable, and practical. Nintendo&#x27;s big brain moment here is that the AR parts aren&#x27;t where you&#x27;re physically looking and I think that&#x27;s really clever."],"time":["2020-09-08 18:29:33"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["wodenokoto"],"id":[24411462],"kids":{},"parent":[24409327],"text":["If you like me, don&#x27;t know how to read a twitter thread:<p>- Someone found a link and a title that appears to point to an Apple event.<p>- There is a link to a 3D file: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apple.com&#x2F;105&#x2F;media&#x2F;us&#x2F;apple-events&#x2F;2020&#x2F;4239dd5f-d9de-4352-9894-0c3ee56588ce&#x2F;quick-look&#x2F;apple_event.usdz\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apple.com&#x2F;105&#x2F;media&#x2F;us&#x2F;apple-events&#x2F;2020&#x2F;4239dd5f-d9...<\/a> INTER<p>- That file can somehow be viewed as AR, as recorded by another user: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;i&#x2F;status&#x2F;1303366736855486464\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;i&#x2F;status&#x2F;1303366736855486464<\/a><p>- The actual event is publicized here and not really mentioned in the thread: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.apple.com&#x2F;apple-events&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.apple.com&#x2F;apple-events&#x2F;<\/a>"],"time":["2020-09-08 20:40:14"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["xsmasher"],"id":[24409787],"kids":[24410101],"parent":[24409327],"text":["&gt; (Also neat, I didn&#x27;t realize the Mac Preview app supported 3d models.)<p>I had the same pleasant surprise browsing through STL files for 3d printing; it&#x27;s nice to be able to view them right in the finder."],"time":["2020-09-08 18:10:38"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["BrianHenryIE"],"id":[24410797],"kids":{},"parent":[24409327],"text":["I read that as &quot;we are launching a new product and you will be able to see it in 3D at home as soon as it is announced&quot;  not &quot;the product is AR&quot;.

We&#x27;re building a scalable and reliable UAV based delivery system with a focus on making medical supplies accessible to all humans that need them. We&#x27;re operating distribution centers in Rwanda, Ghana, and North Carolina, and I believe we&#x27;re still the only such system operating in production.<p>I&#x27;m an embedded software engineer, and I work on a lot on the firmware running in the vehicles, as well as in all the various ground equipment we&#x27;ve developed to make our system easier to operate. I also touch a lot of &quot;high level&quot; python to build out developer tools and when interfacing to the company&#x27;s broader software stacks. It&#x27;s important for our system to be as automated as possible so that we can hire and train local flight operators to serve their communities with minimal engineering support. I think that&#x27;s something really cool about Zipline. Our flight operators are the most awesome, dedicated employees, and they&#x27;re in the trenches launching hundreds of flights per day through extreme rain, heat and cold. I want to say that something like 1&#x2F;3 of flights are for medical emergencies, too.<p>I&#x27;ve been very happy working here, also. It&#x27;s a really good group of people. Everyone&#x27;s dedicated and self motivated to move quickly, without compromising family or work life balance. We try to keep communication within the company as flat and direct as possible, too. There&#x27;s no corporate politics or egos to maneuver around. Our CEO&#x27;s car is one of the crappier cars in the parking lot. For surprise medical reasons I had to take quite a bit of time off at a really quite terrible time in the schedule earlier this year, and my coworkers happily picked up the slack and sent me an embarrassing amount of very luxurious chocolate.<p>Since I joined, my team has grown from just me to about a dozen people, and all the growth has done is made us busier with all the cool projects we&#x27;re taking on. We&#x27;re generally always hiring across the company, and especially on the embedded engineering team. Since I&#x27;ve been around a while, I tend to focus on broad architectural work while helping out on whatever project is the most on fire, and try to give newer team members a chance to focus on projects that they can own long term.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;flyzipline.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;flyzipline.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;<\/a><p>This is what I&#x27;ve been working on improving this past week.

That&#x27;s useful for real time. A standard test for real time is to run a hard real time OS like QNX, and have a simple program which receives an interrupt from an input pin and restarts a high priority task that&#x27;s waiting for the interrupt. The high priority task turns on an output pin.  You hook the input and output pins to an oscilloscope. You want to see all the output spikes about the same distance from the input spikes. You don&#x27;t want to see output outliers way out there, late. If you see that, it&#x27;s not a hard real time system. You can do this with a standalone program to test the CPU by itself, but you really need to test it when the CPU is also doing other things.<p>Sources of CPU-level trouble include 1) rarely used CPU instructions that run slow microcode, 2) cases where the pipeline needs a total flush and that&#x27;s slow, 3) the board manufacturer doing something in system management mode and not telling you.

The driver had to drive it up to the ditch and stop. Then lock five legs, and, using a joystick, move one of the leading legs across the ditch and set it down. Then, with support in place, move the vehicle forward slightly with no leg lifts. Then lock five legs again, and place the second forward leg. Repeat until all six legs had made it across.<p>Cool, but not useful.<p>In the 1990s, a company in Finland got this right.[1] They built a six-legged walking timber harvester. It&#x27;s impressive.

Fixed in clang-11.  That was just the first found+fixed, but we have a good list of what to look at next.  The only real samples showing up in the llvm namespace (vs clang) is llvm&#x27;s StringMap bucket lookup but that&#x27;s from clang&#x27;s preprocessor.<p>* GCC beats the crap out of Clang in compile times of the Linux kernel; we need to start looking for top down optimizations to do less work overall.

Using instruction counts to compare the performance of two entirely different programs (e.g. GCC vs clang) would be foolish, but it’s reasonable to use them to compare the performance of two almost-identical programs (e.g. rustc before PR #12345 and rustc after PR #12345).

If the parallel version of the rustc front-end ever becomes the default, it will be interesting to see if instruction counts continue to be effective in this manner.<p>This is a supremely surprising conclusion, especially in 2020. Is instruction count really still tied to wall clock count?

The tide is (or should be) a familiar feature to any British holiday maker. Many of our nicest beaches are completely submerged at high tide, such as Tenby. At low tide beaches are revealed allowing safe passage to islands which were cut off only hours before. Conversely, some beaches are nicer at high tide. The low tide at Weston-super-Mare leaves a mile of treacherous mud in place of the sea.<p>But these flats are the most fascinating of all. On first glance these areas can seem boring: vast stretches of mud, sand and saltmarshes with just a glimpse of sea right in the distance. But it&#x27;s treacherous and mysterious. Apart from the odd samphire picker, nobody comes out here. Twice a day the landscape is utterly transformed by the tide. And it happens so quickly.<p>I recently visited a favourite place of mine in The Wash. There are two artificial islands here that were built as a failed experiment to build a freshwater reservoir. The smaller of the two is accessible across the saltmarshes which are usually dry. The path used to be a causeway, but these days the whole marsh is above mean high water spring. The larger island can only be reached by crossing the perilous mud flats at very low tide. But it&#x27;s riddled with deep tidal channels and quicksand. Legend has it King John lost his treasure out here as his baggage carts were consumed by the rising tide.<p>On my recent visit I decided to go at a very high tide. The highest of the year. I expected it to be more fun as the island would be more like an island, but I didn&#x27;t expect the saltmarshes to be completely flooded (even though this is well known by locals, and now me). We decided to wade across anyway. The water was knee deep and I was carefully looking out for tidal inlets. As the tide was now receding, these inlets begin to flow outwards like a river, and with enough force to carry you with them. I felt confident enough only because I&#x27;d been here before. We reached the island now an hour after highest tide. Within another hour the sea recedes enough to reveal bizarre looking fingers of water formed by the never ending tide as it gently washes in and out like clockwork every 6 hours.<p>When you read tide tables for an unfamiliar area the numbers don&#x27;t really mean much, other than one is higher than the other. But think about it: a metre of water. That&#x27;s how much higher the tide was on that day. If you live in a flat area just imagine how much would be covered with an extra metre of water. It&#x27;s scary. But fascinating."],"time":["2020-09-08 12:42:47"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["tpmx"],"id":[24403261],"kids":{},"parent":[24390353],"text":["Are there proper warnings for this place in Google&#x2F;Apple&#x2F;Microsoft map services?

Seneca&#x27;s letters have many different exhortations on &quot;preparing for death&quot;. Some choice quotes:<p>• &quot;Many people grasp and hold on to life, like those caught by a flash flood who grasp at weeds and brambles. Most are tossed about between the fear of death and the torments of life: they do not want to live but do not know how to die. Cast off your solicitude for life, then, and in doing so make life enjoyable for yourself. No good thing benefits us while we have it unless we are mentally prepared for the loss of it.&quot; — Seneca<p>• &quot;Epicurus says &#x27;It is a fine thing to learn death thoroughly.&#x27;  Perhaps you think it is a waste of time to learn something you will need to use only once. But that is the very reason we ought to rehearse: if we cannot test whether we know it, we should be learning it always.&quot; — Seneca riffing on Epicurus (not to be confused with <i>Epictetus<\/i>, a Stoic; he even has a discourse titled &quot;Against Epicurus&quot;)<p>• &quot;As the water clock does not empty out its last drop only but also whatever dripped through it before, so our last hour of existence is not the only time we die but just the only time we finish dying. Death is not one event; the death that takes us is our last.&quot; — Seneca<p>• &quot;Years are not given out by quota. There&#x27;s no way to know the point where death lies waiting for you, you must wait for death at every point.&quot; — Seneca<p>• &quot;Let death be before your eyes every day, and you will never have a base thought or an excessive desire.&quot; — Marcus Aurelius<p>• &quot;The torment we feel comes about through our own agency, because we become alarmed when we believe that death is close at hand.  But isn&#x27;t it close to everyone, ready in place and every moment?&quot; — Seneca<p>• &quot;Think about arranging the present as best as you can, with serene mind.

Which is why, when starting from scratch as CTO at two companies, I set it as a top priority from day one.  In both instances, onboarding was optimized as much as possible.  In one company, we used Okta, and 90% of accounts needed to be productive (Git, Jira, Confluence, the HR system, etc) were auto-created prior to the start date.   We reduced, as much as possible, the need to manually create or request access to needed systems.  Instead, based on your job function, we already knew what you would need access to and automatically made those requisitions.  I realize this is easier to do when you are starting from scratch, but it demonstrates that it is feasible.  It’s simply a matter of will and valuing the importance of a smooth onboarding experience.  After all, you spent a ton of time and money finding this candidate - why not get them productive as fast as possible?<p>Setting up the development environment was also scripted.  We had scripts for setting up and installing the tools needed for frontend and backend development.  Common aliases and scripts were shared via a shared “dot files”.  In most cases, it was possible to checkout the relevant repos, run unit tests, commit code and deploy to production on the first or second day.  There is no reason one can’t have all you need ready to go on day one.  Certainly things get out of date as time passes, but the expectation of every new hire was to improve the documentation and fix any flaws.  This “onboarding as code” mentality also made it easier when an experienced engineer needed to set up a new laptop.  Documentation is like a garden - it needs to be constantly weeded and pruned.<p>Finally, there’s the matter of learning the tech stack, code base and current toolset.  Again, this needs to be a deliberate, well thought out experience rather than an ad-hoc, thrown into the deep-end of the pool, sink-or-swim challenge.  A manager needs to make it their top priority to figure out how to get new employees (or internal transfers) up to speed and confident as quickly as possible.  This requires special skills in writing good documentation and figuring out the various learning styles of engineers.<p>I agree - if you onboard, and struggle getting code to compile, can’t find the right documentation about how things work - then it sours your experience with the company.  In some cases it feels like onboarding is a struggle and it’s a badge of honor to have survived.

Any single one could easily be read hundreds of times over during the lifespan of a librarian. Therefore, the book’s gibberish nature did not come of its own accord but simply sprouted out of its relation to us and our lack of knowledge concerning the Library as a whole. In other words, for any book to make any sense to any librarian, it must have recognizable patterns, like those in language. And since every possible book that could exist did, most of them were simply random, nonsensical strings of characters. Leaving the librarians themselves to search for the language or sets of languages that could bring meaning to them (them:themselves or them:the books no one was sure). This was reflected — maybe the same sort of reflection Tanner was searching for — in the various languages the librarians did know and use; the ever-evolving nature of them, incorporating and condensing larger and larger swaths of ideas that then needed to be condensed even further into shorter acronyms for quicker reference.&quot;<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@odell.brenden&#x2F;a-return-to-the-library-of-babel-cb8f479f6000\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@odell.brenden&#x2F;a-return-to-the-library-of...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-09-07 15:29:18"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Animats"],"id":[24396607],"kids":[24397234],"parent":[24395822],"text":["Prediction and compression as a way to encode data cheaply is a reasonable idea.

The more that data is compressed, the harder it becomes to compress it further (Chaitin, 2006).

Compression is relevant inasmuch as our brains perform lossy compression to capture the relevant regularity in our sense data. But this is only the start of the analysis; it doesn&#x27;t explain anything useful about our cognitive architecture. The problem is strong compression trades space requirements for computational requirements. But going all-in on compression is optimizing for the wrong thing in the context of a bag-of-neurons computational model.<p>von Neumann architectures are good at fast and precise state transitions. A bag-of-neurons is good at leveraging relationships to minimize computational requirements. Thus a plausible cognitive architecture for the mind should emphasize relationships rather than computation. A good cognitive architecture is one where relationships in the data are maximally revealed by the architecture, thus minimizing the computational burden to access and utilize the relationship. This explains why the visual system takes up so much volume of the brain. 3-dimensional sense data is packed with interrelationships and these relationships need support from the cognitive architecture to be utilized. The compression view is only useful to a point--after that the constraints on the bag-of-neurons model become dominant and must drive the architecture search.<p>When it comes to phenomenal consciousness, the question then becomes: is there anything it is like to be a process whose topological structure maximally captures external and internal state relationships? My intuition tells me the answer is yes. One functional requirement of a human brain is that it `believes` it is the author of its decisions. To manifest this `belief` requires a self-representation of itself distinct from the environment, i.e. a target of the attribution of authorship.

Foreigners don&#x27;t always understand the dictatorships use a two-pronged approach, one part being heavy-handed violence and the other being heavy-handed propaganda. Like it or not, there&#x27;s always a percentage of the population that buys into the propaganda, either by being stupid or by being centrist.<p>The protesters are very intentionally being careful to not give any excuse. That&#x27;s why you see 70-year-old grandmothers walking in the streets wearing pure white, they want the evidence to be obvious when the police shove down and beat grandmother&#x27;s bloody. They also want it to be impossible for the state to spin them as violent criminals<p>In short, these people are brave as f<i><\/i>*<p>Many do suspect this will end in all out violence, but everyone knows that would give Russia an internationally acceptable excuse to join the party. The current thinking is Lukashenko may make a mistake (it is widely reported internally that he is on heavy medication and typically takes an entire month away from office following the election period, which has been impossible with the constant mass protests). His family has begun to leave the country, excluding his young son who he takes with him everywhere.<p>The people are being careful to say, at least for the time being, they do not want him dead, they only do not want him in the country. They&#x27;re trying to give him every opportunity to flee and leave them to repair their own country<p>If you want to help, the biggest thing you can do is continue to give them international recognition. Share it on social platforms. After the first wave of violence, the international outcry caused Lukashenko to order the police to temporarily stop the beatings. The protests have continues to grow, and the violence has started again (as we all know, dictators have a really small playbook of possible control tactics). International outrage is more effective than you might realize.<p>EDIT: For those unaware, IT has grown significantly in Belarus. It&#x27;s debated why this is the case (e.g. perhaps the dictatorship just does not know how to extract value from a company where seizing assets just leaves you with an empty shell of a previously valuable company), but regardless multiple Belarusians are entering the world stage with a reputation for being competent&#x2F;capable&#x2F;innovative with technology. It&#x27;s been a interesting emergence of a new skilled class. Right now, Lukashenko is squishing that with his actions. Shutting of the internet is one example. Another example is retaliation, such as what is being done to PandaDoc (a Silicon Valley-based company). Their founders are Belarusian. After a statement by the founders, the state retaliated by raiding their Minsk offices and arresting employees.

I&#x27;m going to give you the keys to the PHI kingdom, I need to know who&#x27;s soliciting me. Are you two twenty-somethings with amazing skills and ideas, or 20 ex-Epic employees looking to fill a particular gap you found? Without this general information I wouldn&#x27;t know what sort of project to think about including you in.<p>2. Where are you? I&#x27;m under contract with numerous health agencies that require data to be on US soil. I have no idea if you are in Romania or Virginia. (Side note, government is the biggest purchaser of health care and therefore your paths will cross at some point, even if it&#x27;s simply being downstream of federal or state data.)<p>3. How compliant are you? Your one page tells me nothing about your understanding of HIPAA, nor how you ensure the security and privacy of the data you will be exposed to. It may seem as if anyone in the space _should_ know about this and the reader can assume compliance, but frankly it&#x27;s not the case. Yell at me about your third-party audits, your ability to transact PHI, as well as any SOC&#x2F;FISMA compliance you have.<p>4. What have you done before? There are a lot of corners in the niche, and I&#x27;d need to know what systems you&#x27;ve worked with, what you&#x27;ve built and who for, so I can get an understanding of whether or not you&#x27;d be a good fit.<p>As for leads, with most conferences going virtual your usual approach of HIMSS is buggered, but Healthcare Datapalooza just put out a call for presentations so they&#x27;re likely looking for (virtual) sponsors already.

I have no expertise in healthcare technology, so maybe that&#x27;s the reason, but I could not understand what types of problems you are solving and what you are doing from your website.<p>1. For example, &#x27;Reimagining Healthcare&#x27; is an empty phrase. All your sentences seem vague to me: &quot;Comprehensive Healthcare Solutions and Integrations with FHIR, HL7 and SMART&quot;, are you consulting on how to create these solutions?  are you developing these solutions? are you selling a created solution? Are you integrating somebody&#x27;s else solution?<p>2. There is not a lot of connection to your company in your texts:\n&gt; Healthcare Data Interoperability and Analytics\n&gt; Standards like SMART and FHIR allow healthcare providers to store and share data in an interoperable manner which enables organizations to derive insights to provide effective care efficiently.<p>This is a good description of these standards and why they are important, but what is your connection here? If you are using these standards, then mention it directly. Maybe something like this is better:\n&gt; We use standards like SMART and FHIR to allow healthcare providers...\nAll other texts in Services section have the same problem.<p>3. I don&#x27;t understand the Solutions section. It looks like a collection of icons and slogans. Let&#x27;s take one example: Cloud. So I can guess that you are developing your solutions to be deployed on the cloud. But why make clients guess? Write it directly and mention why this is good. &quot;Our solutions are deployed on cloud. This is good because &lt;...&gt;.&quot;.<p>4. This is just a suggestion. I would add a section of Problems that you can solve. Client come to your sites with problems. So I would write: &quot;1. You have problem X? We can solve it by doing Y.&quot;<p>Overall, you have to think from the eyes of the client. What is the client looking for?<p>But again, I do not know anything about your field. I don&#x27;t know who your clients, what problems they have, and what technology you are building. So you should be very quick to ignore this advice if you think I don&#x27;t have the necessary understanding.<p>But regardless, good luck :)<p>EDIT: typos"],"time":["2020-09-07 12:44:57"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ealexhudson"],"id":[24418941],"kids":[24420288],"parent":[24397821],"text":["So, I work in pretty much this exact area. The main issue is you&#x27;re trying to sell something that customers don&#x27;t buy - any integration, FHIR or HL7 or something, is only ever needed to get one product to talk to another. Usually a new one to talk to the old one; and the business selling the new product is the one in whose interest it is to get the integration working.<p>While it&#x27;s always possible to take existing kit and do more&#x2F;better automation, this kind of operational improvement tends to have little to no budget unless there&#x27;s some specific project being undertaken (e.g. going to structured reporting). Generally, although people are often unhappy with internal software, the business will be operating as-is pretty comfortably. You&#x27;d need to deliver an awful lot of value to make it worthwhile paying you what you need.<p>I would probably look to better define your customer. You might have a better shout trying to approach ISVs who are selling new healthcare products, and asking them to use you as a delivery partner. Many ISVs have weak deployment teams and cannot deal with complex integrations, but they will be the ones with a customer and a contract.

Things like full-disk-encryption for developers, password policies, hardware 2FA for ALL company accounts, SSO for all logins with a single place to delete a credential set, mandatory monthly&#x2F;weekly HIPAA training, etc.<p>Another thing you might want to consider doing is open sourcing some stuff to help setup FHIR&#x2F;HL7 integrations. Pretty much the only fully fledged HL7 &quot;solution&quot; you can get for free HAPI [0]. You might want to make some open source tools around all of this.

Lead generation: People in this space will know who you are<p>2. Trust: Hiring consultants is difficult if you cant see the quality of their work. If you do a good job on these OSS tools you can prove to people that your code quality is high.

Find a specific problem, create something that solves it, and sell that. Once you have customers for that you can move on to try and grow your business with them.
