Entire modern monetary system is based on a trusted party - a central bank. Blockchain provides a way to remove trusted party out of equation. One can argue that existing system just works, why would you want to change something that works? Answer is simple - it does not work in many countries and trusted parties&#x2F;authorities abuse their powers, sometimes in a ways that is not so easy to see.<p>First application of a blockchain is digital money which is free from a central authority. Here is real world scenario that happened in so many places. Your domestic currency is crushing, has lost 30% of it value already and is about to loose another 80%. You want to by US dollars and save what is left but you cannot because government temporary prohibited purchase of a foreign currency. I’m thinking about Russia, Belorussia, Venezuela and many many others.<p>Political activists get blocked by a banking system all the time. For example in Russia there is a “list of terrorists”, people on this list excluded form the banking system. This list probably has some terrorists in it but it also has quite a few activists in it as well. You can go to a protest, grabbed by a police and next day find yourself out of the banking system.<p>Decentralized money is at least partially a solution to issues arising form an authority abusing it powers as cryptocurrency cannot be blocked so easily. It does not have to be used much, it just has to be around.<p>Second blockchain application is smart contracts to simplify value transfer. For example shares offerings - when a company sells it shares to a bunch of investors. It often happens outside of an exchange, without IPO (search for Reg-A, Reg-D offerings). In this process a bank holds investor money until offering completes and a “transfer agent” hold stock in the name of an investor after. Bank and transfer agent are there only because of trust issues, someone has to guarantee that investor pays and receives shares. Investor cannot directly hand over cash to a company because it can fail to pay or company can fail to deliver it shares and then they will have to spend time and money in court. Both bank and transfer agent take their commission just because they trusted and licensed to hold value during and after transaction. These commissions are not small, a bank may take few percents for organizing an offering.<p>Shares can be issued on a blockchain and a smart contract can govern entire value transfer starting from escrow, to enforcing offering conditions and then to transfer of shares and money to counter parties. You can imagine banks might not be happy about loosing their profits but competition in democratic countries slowly but surely drives process in a right direction.<p>Similar examples arise all the time in international trade, trade clearing, interbank relationships, etc, etc. blockchain is a solution to all of this but maybe we need another financial crisis (when  “trusted parties” became not so trusted) to speed up it adoption."],"time":["2020-08-24 08:20:51"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["centimeter"],"id":[24241558],"kids":[24241645],"parent":[24241488],"text":["There are precisely two legitimately useful applications of the blockchain data structure that have been invented:<p>1.

As a dirt poor person from the <i>really<\/i> dirt poor part of Appalachia, if you wanted something, especially in a niche hobby, you built it from near raw materials.<p>At the time, a few of the things I needed had a surprisingly small supply chain&#x2F;availability in the U.S., and with asinine prices at that. One thing in particular, could be found practically nowhere aside from a single source in the U.S., and at something like $20&#x2F;pop with a business type account necessary to purchase.<p>Frustrated, and having been raised by the internet, I went to China, mainly Alibaba&#x2F;AliExpress for sourcing - Tangent: as I write out this comment, I was going to state &quot;back before everybody and their uncle knew about AliExpress in the U.S., atleast.&quot; - turns out, it was only a year after AliExpress had launched. Didn&#x27;t know that till now.<p>So, I found the specific thing I was after - needing only two of them. Two were $8 shipped, 10 was $17 - and these were the exact thing being sold for $20&#x2F;PC from one U.S. supplier, and a pain to purchase. Obvious what choice I made, luckily had an older friend to use their credit card for purchase. Since I only needed the two, I for some reason thought, hey, maybe somebody else might be in my same situation, put them up on eBay for $5&#x2F;PC + shipping, and hoped that maybe 2 or 3 would sell in a month and I&#x27;dve gotten what I needed for basically free.<p>By the end of the night, all eight of them had sold. Kinda shittered myself, and that&#x27;s how I became a go-to stateside supplier of a few very niche fans, some other RC-type hobby supplies, and most notably the second top-seller of quality multi-stranded silicone &quot;hobby&quot; (UL 3135) wire on eBay as a sick 13-15 year old.

I generally did not drop ship it, I ordered it in bulk from a wholesaler and then sold it on eBay, as well as on a website I maintained, which ran a heavily modified version of osCommerce.<p>Buying this one item, which I knew had regular demand, from a retailer allowed me to offer a price which was competitive, but from which I could also make a small profit.  With dropshipping, I was competing against others who could drop ship the same items, so I could not offer as competitive a price, nor have any kind of margin.<p>I used dropshipping for two scenarios.  One was if I traveled and was unable to ship out the item I had in stock.  In this scenario, I would drop ship the item and lose any margin (or sometimes even take a small loss).<p>The other scenario was to test new items to sell.  My main wholesaler (which I bought my 3M bulk item from) could drop ship a catalog of items at a decent rate from their one watehouse.  I also had accounts with two larger dropshipping wholesalers, both of whom had multiple warehouses with mostly the same catalog in stock - with items more likely in stock, but at a higher markup.<p>So what I did was for through my main wholesaler&#x27;s catalog and see what items they had.  I then checked that both other wholesalers had the same item in their catalog, and that all currently had the item in stock.  Generally my main wholesaler would drop ship for the lowest rate.  So I put the item up on my website, at a break even price.  I did this for many items.<p>Sometimes I would have a sale.  Often my main wholesaler still had the item in stock.  I would break even on the sale, but would know there was demand.  Sometimes they would be out of stock - then I would drop ship from one of the two backups and lose some money on the sale.  Maybe I would increase my sale price until I knew my main wholesaler had the item in stock again.<p>As margins were small, one goal was to sell more and increase margins.  If I bought boxes, tape and shipping labels in bulk, my margins increased a few cents per sale - I could decrease the sale price (and increase sales doing so) while also increasing my cut a few cents.  This worked for a number of things - with $3,000 a month in sales my Payapl fees would drop, with $10,000 a month in sales they would drop even more.  This would also allow me to offer more items at a competitive price.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how it works nowadays.  One lesson I learned was what to do when you succeeded.  I got to where I was shipping several items a day and making a small margin, and had the opportunity to ship even more.  But it would then outgrow my closet space - I would need to rent some warehouse space or something to receive shipments and store items.  Also, as sales grew, I spent less time programming my web site, and more time putting items in boxes, taping up boxes, weighing boxes, printing out shipping labels to attach to boxes etc.  I figured I eventually would have to hire someone part time to ship items out during the week.  By then I was familiar enough with the business to decide I did not want to make this leap, and decided to wound down my business.  Actually I stumbled out of the business like I stumbled into it - my friend had some familiarity with some of these wholesalers, knew I could sell online and suggested I try it out, which I did."],"time":["2020-08-22 20:58:28"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["foolinaround"],"id":[24244059],"kids":[24244344,24244319],"parent":[24243763],"text":["&quot;the fool and his money are soon parted&quot;<p>This has become quite a phenomenon due to the rise of the &#x27;influencers&#x27; and a generation that blindly follows them.<p>Even though this method may be legal, the onus is on the people to look for something like BBB certification, and this new certification, whatever form it may be, should be nimble and easy to initially obtain, and fast to update by the consumers."],"time":["2020-08-22 15:41:19"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["tedunangst"],"id":[24246116],"kids":{},"parent":[24243763],"text":["Are these revenues or profits?"],"time":["2020-08-22 20:27:30"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[24244129],"kids":{},"parent":[24243763],"text":{},"time":["2020-08-22 15:51:14"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":[true]},{"by":["twat"],"id":[24247308],"kids":{},"parent":[24243763],"text":["Dropshipping is like MLM, but the scam part happens after the purchase.

The idea of punk itself was the DIY music aspect that moved into clothing and zines, and built an aesthetic that spawned a network of cafes and bars and really is a subculture. The idea of an anti-establishment movement is one that is really just vying for establishment influence by defecting from it instead of negotiating within it, but it&#x27;s still very much a part of it.<p>What I call &quot;punk privilege,&quot; is that almost no punks were ever really poor, and it was a way for the poor to elevate themselves into an anti-middle class that was appendent to the middle class. In the 80&#x27;s and 90&#x27;s, punk and other subcultures were actually a path out of the underclass and into (the almost exclusively white) bohemian culture, and a way for technocratic up and comers to signify their skills. (e.g. &quot;I&#x27;m so good the establishment tolerates my green hair&quot;) It&#x27;s been through generations of co-opting, where now old punk aesthetics are a signal of membership in the new establishment, with pink and green haired people operating the administrative layers of academia and government, and the &quot;real punk,&quot; that is, the  independent creative networks that diverge from this new establishemnt are attracting outsiders and creating a primordial soup for the next wave of culture and innovation. What is surely true is that it will be a divergent reaction to the current establishment. I don&#x27;t think this particular Solar punk aesthetic has enough grit to survive, but not being a part of it, it&#x27;s not for me, it&#x27;s for the people who do it and participate, which is ultimately what makes it punk."],"time":["2020-08-22 16:07:03"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["nkrisc"],"id":[24243854],"kids":[24243908,24243930,24243954],"parent":[24230502],"text":["Unrelated to the actual substance of the writing, I was completely mystified by this passage:<p>&gt; In truth, solarpunk is functional AF.

Given a local repo, Codemap statically parses the code and renders a directed graph of all function calls in the least cluttered layout. It helps programmers familiarize with a new codebase, trace possible scenarios that lead to a bug in a function, or understand the scope of impact when making a code change. Codemap runs offline on your local machine and never sends any sensitive code data to remote servers.<p>I built Codemap because I noticed that good engineers always spend quality time understanding the code architecture before making changes. This process is crucial, and it usually requires drawing a function call diagram on a whiteboard or in the head. Some people use IDE &quot;Find usage of function...&quot; search box for a million times, some people ask senior engineers for tribal knowledge, and some just get lazy and start writing code with ignorance.<p>As a software engineer, I think there&#x27;s a better solution than this tedious and error-prone practice. I looked at existing code visualization tools and felt that the visualization tends to be overly cluttered and not that user-friendly. I believed that, with some level of design, I can build a tool that is pleasant to use, easy to navigate, and versatile for any codebase in the supported languages.<p>During the development of Codemap, I would sometimes grab a popular Github repo to test the Codemap app, and I often find myself exploring its call graph for hours to satisfy my genuine curiosity of &quot;How does &lt;popular project&gt; work?&quot; I&#x27;d encourage curious HN readers to visit the website and see screenshots of call graphs from React, Keras, Django, and Typescript (yep the one from Microsoft).<p>I would love to hear what you love and hate, as well as any questions you may have.

I only did the first part to some extent: parsed JS and rendered the AST into a treemap using WebGL.<p>What I actually envisioned in my mind is a 3d nested boxes rendered in a &quot;galaxy style&quot; where you can fly from one box to another, click on boxes to show their sub-boxes and see the lines that represent connections. The 3d space would allow to unclutter the image.<p>Edit1. While I think that nested boxes is the natural way to represent ownership, it&#x27;s often difficult to figure this ownership from the code. For example, class A is really the owner of B and C, but those are given to A as args in the constructor, so to an unsophisticated analyzer tool, B and C would be just deps. Perhaps the tool should allow the user to adjust the relationship status between objects based on some a priori knowledge. The changes would need to be saved, so next time the diagram is rebuilt from code, the visualizer would remember that A owns B and C. I believe this would be really useful in big companies that struggle to keep such diagrams up to date.<p>Edit2.

Do remember to cancel. Thank me later.<p>Second: The whole download&#x2F;install experience is a trip.  You need to download about ~90 GB of data (no problem!). However, the downloader is abysmal. It&#x27;s not optimized for throughput at all, each (often small) file is individually downloaded and then uncompressed in sequence. Is this 1997? My favorite bug: if you minimize the download window it starts using 100% of the GPU. This is kind of indicative of what you&#x27;ll experience later on - that special kind of randomness that stems from developer incompetence. Most people (including me) seem to need to restart the whole thing a couple of times. Loads of people are simply stuck at the download step.<p>Third: Loading times with this game are insane. It can take a minute or two (with a very fast 6-core CPU, 1 Gbit&#x2F;s network connection, M.2 SSD, etc) to load the main menu, because it seems to download the scenery for the stuff that is vaguely visible in the background scenery every time. Then another minute or two for actually getting started with your flight. And when going back from flight mode to the main menu: yeah, another 1-2 mins.<p>Fourth: When you actually get to start the aircraft:<p>- There are loads of bugs that cause insane FPS drops&#x2F;frameskips.<p>- There currently seems to exist an issue that causes FPS slowdowns <i>when the Azure-based geometry servers are slow<\/i>. Did they do blocking networking in the same thread as the rendering? :) No idea, but the propblem is for for real. The typical FPS is higher when fewer people are playing. All of those gorgeous youtube videos you&#x27;ve seen from before the launch? Yeah, those are no longer representative. Also, I think most of them have been carefully edited. There are just way too many random FPS \n and frame skipping bugs abound. It&#x27;s a mess.<p>I recommend looking at a recorded live stream (from recent days) to get a better understanding of the simulation performance.<p>(I&#x27;ve spent maybe 6 hours with MSFS2020 so far.)<p>Fifth: This is a very complicated application. There is no documentation.<p>Sixth: I&#x27;m running on a GTX 1070 with 8 GB of video memory, so sadly I can only run this at 1080p. When everything is working perfectly it&#x27;s kinda smooth - about 40 fps. Most of the time though, something is causing a severe FPS slowdown, so closer to 5-10 fps. It&#x27;s all kind of random. It seems like most of these issues are bugs, rather than the hardware meeting actual limitations. Changing the display quality (ultra&#x2F;high&#x2F;etc doesn&#x27;t really impact these random variations in FPS much.)<p>Seventh: The in-game credits start with this sequence: DESIGN, UI DEVELOPMENT, PROGRAMMING. Maybe I&#x27;m being overly sensitive here, but to me this order could sort of explain why this disaster shipped in its current form.<p>This is just the tip of the iceberg. So many insane bugs.<p>Most infuriating of all: The constant social media spam about how this is fantastic.

For those of us working in other countries and in unglamorous companies it has always been a very different kind of culture. Typically SV pioneers new ideas and new ways of working, and then over the next 5 to 10 years this slowly permeates global programming culture, but watered down.<p>Covid has changed this dynamic because for once everything is changing everywhere all at once. I noticed two major changes already. The first thing was freelance work drying up, because new projects were put on hold. With most of the economic consequences (and bankruptcies) still to happen, this could go either way. Either the tech sector has a lot less work, with wages falling and everyone trying to get the security of a salaried position, or there is a boom of software with businesses trying to retool and freelance work coming back with a vengeance. The second thing is obviously the shift to WFH. This move could conclude with everyone being ordered back to the office (once vaccinated), or with structural WFH being a thing for always, and many if not most developers rarely seeing the inside of an office. I don’t think anyone knows where it is headed, but the global impact of covid makes it that for the first time the changes to programming culture are likely to happen everywhere at once, instead of happening first in SV and then slowly rippling out.

Products like like Google Docs, social networks, messaging app, etc don&#x27;t depend on a proof of stake, and we shouldn&#x27;t be running miners to power such simple operations. All these applications need isa decentralized form of message distribution and log storage paired with public-key cryptography in order to build a CRDT log. I understand why IPFS in itself at first glance often seems over-hyped, since it is essentially just a hyper-distributed caching layer. However, I highly recommend looking at technologies built on top of it like [OrbitDB](<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;orbitdb&#x2F;orbit-db\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;orbitdb&#x2F;orbit-db<\/a>) and [Textile](<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;textile.io&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;textile.io&#x2F;<\/a>). When they work reliably, their API is as easy if not easier than other &quot;server-less&quot; products like Firebase or Parse to use. Once libraries like these become mature, I believe the way we build software will be flipped on its head within 10-15 years to be completely client focused with minimal backend infrastructure.<p>The main advantages I see are:<p>* Increased reliability. This allows developers to remove almost all of their centralized servers and rely instead on a common infrastructure and protocol.<p>* Much simpler codebases and infrastructure. You only need to write a frontend for most applications. Building on u&#x2F;searchableguy&#x27;s comment: I can see no&#x2F;low code tooling really taking off with decentralized-first applications, since there is no need to manage a complicated backend infrastructure with vendor lock-in.<p>* Real-time by default. Since IPFS databases run off of CRDT logs which rely on realtime syncing of new operations, they are benefit from immediate updates at all times – even when not connected to the main swarm out in the boonies.\n* Offline-first by default.<p>* Cost&#x2F;resource efficiency. No technology is magical, but [this](<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;withblue.ink&#x2F;2019&#x2F;03&#x2F;20&#x2F;hugo-and-ipfs-how-this-blog-works-and-scales.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;withblue.ink&#x2F;2019&#x2F;03&#x2F;20&#x2F;hugo-and-ipfs-how-this-blog-...<\/a>) article from March is an early real world demonstration of how well this technology works already.<p>* Transport agnostic. It&#x27;s completely feasible to have your watch, your phone, and your laptop have their IPFS nodes connected over Bluetooth, but never have to worry about if and how they&#x27;re connected together since IPFS takes care of handling that P2P connectivity automatically. Instead of writing code that says &quot;my watch created a reminder, upload this to the cloud for my laptop and also tell my phone this happened if we&#x27;re connected,&quot; I can just write &quot;my watch created a reminder, broadcast this operation to the IPFS network&quot; and your phone and laptop will automatically receive this update.<p>* Security. The less that is stored on centralized servers, the better. While OrbitDB is not built to work off an encrypted database yet (it&#x27;s in the roadmap for v1), Textile already is. Having everything be encrypted by default and optionally never leaving my device has many advantages.<p>The main challenges I see blocking this from going mainstream:<p>* Reliability still feels like the early days of the internet. The database-level libraries are still young, IPFS is slow&#x2F;unreliable at times, and browser support is fairly strong but still has a way to go, and native mobile&#x2F;native support is nonexistent.<p>* Filecoin is not ready yet. You still need to run your own IPFS node&#x2F;swarm in order to do anything serious. Existing pinning services can only go so far if you&#x27;re working with something like OrbitDB.<p>* Education. Security is of upmost important when designing technologies like this, so developers need to understand how a CRDT log works, how to build with merge conflicts in mind, and how to write&#x2F;manage custom ACL for complex interactions. It also takes a different way of thinking to design networks like this.<p>* Reliability and security audits.<p>* Transport protocols. At the moment, many of the advantages of P2P over things like Bluetooth have not been realized yet since the IPFS core is still where most of the development is focused at the moment.<p>* Cross-platform support. IPFS only has an official Go and JavaScript node implementation with a Rust implementation in the works. While Go has become fairly portable in recent years, it still has a very bloated runtime that doesn&#x27;t embed well on mobile and web. Once we have a reliable Rust port and some OrbitDB-like Rust-based libraries ports, I suspect we&#x27;ll start seeing ergonomic mobile and web APIs that bind to these popping up.<p>To be clear, I&#x27;m not saying centralized servers will vanish in to thin air. There are many tasks like indexing large amounts of data that are incredibly difficult and not beneficial to build on a distributed network. The decentralized web – if done right – will make developers&#x27; lives much easier for many common applications, but there should not be a need to port things that aren&#x27;t practical to run on the Dweb.<p>[Edit: Formatting]"],"time":["2020-08-22 16:36:29"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[24244528],"kids":{},"parent":[24243598],"text":{},"time":["2020-08-22 16:54:26"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":["UncleOxidant"],"id":[24245843],"kids":{},"parent":[24243598],"text":["Rapid tests you can do at home for a variety of viral illnesses, initially for COVID-19, but expanding to a wider variety of viruses and virus types.

This approach chimes with how (I think) community can be sustainably built and expanded in tech, both parties benefiting from possible out-of-band experiences. There’s no guarantee of that, of course, but that’s a risk people can assess when spending their time. People love talking about what they do, both for personal brand and personal enjoyment (Meet-ups and less corporate conferences are clear examples of this).<p>Wish the expectations of these conversations were more outlined, though.  “Get on the waitlist” is a bit of a black box.<p>Also, maybe this is personal bias, but allowing for non-Twitter handles (I think my HN handle better resonates with my technical leanings than my Twitter, which is mostly just me posting more or less random thoughts).  Looks like they’re using Twitter authentication, though, as well the “We met up” tweets have some virality, so I understand that design choice at the current moment.<p>After seeing a former teacher of mine ask about people who’d be willing to talk with his high school students, I think there’s also an extension of this platform to help match speakers with educators trying to help students understand what it means to work in technology (Or other fields).  When I was an undergraduate we’d run part of a summer program teaching high school students how to differentiate stem cells into beating heart cells, hard to say that example wouldn’t be formative for students trying to figure out what to pursue in the future."],"time":["2020-08-22 19:44:25"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["chrisdietr"],"id":[24246262],"kids":[24246285],"parent":[24244721],"text":["Hi, early cuppa user.

This of course through me off for the rest of the interview day, because I tend to chew on problems that I have trouble with and tend to not let go of them quickly until I have some better understanding of the issue (including perhaps my limitations in being able to do anything about it).<p>So after the interview, as I tend to do, I did a bit of research, and came across this article of Kernighan<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.princeton.edu&#x2F;courses&#x2F;archive&#x2F;spr09&#x2F;cos333&#x2F;beautiful.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.princeton.edu&#x2F;courses&#x2F;archive&#x2F;spr09&#x2F;cos333&#x2F;be...<\/a><p>which put everything into context beautifully<p>now, why do I think its a terrible interview Q?

Take a simple character by character string matcher as Rob Pike wrote, and ask the interviewee to expand on it, how would they add different functionality to it.  1) could they add &#x27;.&#x27;, 2) could they enable it to match anywhere in the text, 3) could they add anchors, 4) and if really good, could they add star support.  You get to see how the interviewee thinks about code, thinks to modify code, and being regex, still provides a good basis for thinking about tests.  I hope people I interview find this to be a tractable Q.<p>Getting back to my story, in order to prove to myself I wasn&#x27;t an idiot (and to learn some java, I was mostly a C programmer in the linux kernel at the time), I decided to take Rob Pike&#x27;s approach and try to implement as much of a regex matching engine as I could<p>which turned into <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;sjpotter&#x2F;regex\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;sjpotter&#x2F;regex<\/a>.<p>then when I needed to improve my Go programming skills (and explore possibly bad ways of doing Go programming), I ported it to <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;sjpotter&#x2F;regex-go\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;sjpotter&#x2F;regex-go<\/a><p>now, what&#x27;s the point of this story in regards to the article?

(My previous comments about this.[0][1])<p>- protocols do not provide humans assistants such as system administrators or a salaried staff of IT workers to run &amp; maintain decentralized systems for others.  (E.g. my previous comment[2] that us uber geeks on HN know how to run Git but it doesn&#x27;t matter because we don&#x27;t have the time nor enthusiasm to run decentralized git on our home laptop, or Gitlab on Raspberry Pi to serve our repos to others.  It&#x27;s easier to just use centralized Github.)<p>If you&#x27;re thinking that money and staffing are <i>&quot;out of scope&quot;<\/i> for a decentralized open protocol RFC, you are correct!  But that&#x27;s also why decentralized protocols don&#x27;t lead to the decentralized utopia that enthusiasts envision.  Consider that both the protocols TCPIP an HTTP are <i>already decentralized<\/i> -- and yet one decentralized node spelled &quot;thefacebook.com&quot; (and later changed to &quot;facebook.com&quot;) is now feared as too <i>centralized<\/i>.  Think deeply about how &amp; why that happened.  If your mental framework is limited to thinking about &quot;protocols&quot;, Facebook being centralized is a mysterious contradiction to decentralized tcpip&#x2F;http.  However, if your mental model <i>includes economic forces<\/i>, there is no contradiction.<p><i>&gt;web remains community-focused and user-oriented, just like it was originally intended to be.<\/i><p>Yes, Tim Berners-Lee developed the open http <i>protocol<\/i> and also open HTML language but he was originally trying to get scientists to share their data more easily.  He and his colleagues&#x27; salaries and their computers and servers to run http+html were <i>paid for by the government<\/i>.

We&#x27;re actually going backwards.  Look at history to see that open protocols do not achieve that goal as intuition would lead you to believe.  Instead, integrate realistic <i>economic incentives<\/i> into your predictions for a decentralized future and write new essays that take that into account.  Think about why the original Bitcoin whitepaper didn&#x27;t predict that mining would shift from a wide open democracy of home computers to a handful of miners in China.  Even the open protocol of Bitcoin blockchain couldn&#x27;t prevent economic incentives to consolidate into mining pools.  A protocol can&#x27;t stop a handful of miners in China to <i>spend more money<\/i> on custom ASIC chips and run thousands of them in datacenters to shift the balance of blockchain power from the hobbyists that mined on home computers with AMD graphics cards.<p>Maybe a thought experiment in a different domain to help break out of &quot;open protocol&quot; thinking:  The blockbuster film industry of English-language movies is too &quot;centralized&quot; in Hollywood.  Hmmm... so let&#x27;s create a new language (maybe Esperanto?) so that it breaks the power of Hollywood and 1000 decentralized film communities making Esperanto movies can flourish in places like Alabama and Montana.

This is an entity with a special position in the stock market which has the privilege of redeeming ETF units to obtain their underlying stocks, and well as parcelling up stocks and trade them for a unit of ETF.<p>See <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;viewer?url=https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.blackrock.com&#x2F;corporate&#x2F;literature&#x2F;whitepaper&#x2F;viewpoint-etf-primary-trading-role-of-authorized-participants-march-2017.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;viewer?url=https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.blackrock.com...<\/a> for details<p>But essentially, ETF act like stocks, but there&#x27;s always a flexible amount of outstanding units (unlike stocks in companies, which usually have a fixed number of units outstanding). Investors buy&#x2F;sell ETFs between each other most times, and the AP doesn&#x27;t get involved (and thus units outstanding doesn&#x27;t change). But at some point, demand for ETF units grow to be bigger than the numbers available for sale (everyone is holding it and not selling, for example), and the price of each unit grows. At some point, it makes sense for the AP to buy up the set of underlying stocks, parcel it up and trade them for an ETF unit (from the ETF issuer - like vanguard), and sell it for an arbitraged profit. This then increases the number of units outstanding for the ETF, and thus, reduces demand, and stablizing the prices.<p>The opposite also happens - when there are too many sellers of an ETF, the AP will purchase the ETF and redeem the underlying stocks from the issuer, and sell those stocks for an arbitraged profit. So the end result is that the value of each individual ETF unit almost exactly match the value of the parcel of shares it represents (as the AP is financially incentivized to buy&#x2F;sell and arbitrage any profit out of this difference)."],"time":["2020-09-21 06:31:52"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["RickJWagner"],"id":[24542238],"kids":{},"parent":[24539605],"text":["Old guy here.

It&#x27;s a beautiful time to be an investor, between zero-fee trades and easy access to a lot of excellent information and tools (in most cases now packaged with a common brokerage account).<p>My advice would be to do exactly what you&#x27;re doing in regards to index funds, since this is your first money going into the market. If this very richly valued market drops at some point, it&#x27;s going to sting, don&#x27;t let that dissuade you from the long-term course, which is: investing as a matter of routine over time, you&#x27;re in it for a lifetime, not a short-term flip; and during that lifetime, there will be many ups and downs. Always do your best to hold a long-term mentality about what you&#x27;re trying to accomplish.<p>Depending on your personality, your preferences for learning about investing and managing your own money (it&#x27;s incredibly boring to many people in my experience), you might consider setting aside a small slice of your investment money to invest into specific companies that you&#x27;re interested in (ideally sticking to higher-quality, well-known, longer track record companies, so as to improve your odds of avoiding the Nikolas out there). Use that stake as a self-interest booster to practice reading about a company, following their progress, read their financials, read their quarterly and annual reports, read some of their archived annual reports. Practice basic due diligence on an investment that you&#x27;re interested in (eg AMD, whatever it happens to be). Get used to the terminology, teach yourself to be able to digest financial information about companies rapidly, so that it&#x27;s second nature. Then with a better grasp, begin practicing comparing companies, which will help you build some baseline comparison capabilities (so you&#x27;ll be able to more rapidly grasp good or bad numbers from a company). Occasionally read business news, although don&#x27;t bother with the bulls &amp; bears type junk, the clickbait of the business &amp; financial news world; read about concepts and events (like mergers &amp; acquisitions, or stock issuances, IPOs, conflicts), to further educate yourself about how the markets work and get a feel for that world. This basic learning aspect doesn&#x27;t take a lot of time, an hour per week, kept up over time. The end result is extremely valuable: considerably improved financial literacy; it gives you a leg up, as the vast majority of populations even in affluent nations tend to have a weak understanding of financial markets and stocks.<p>I&#x27;m biased in my recommendations, I&#x27;m a modified value investor in terms of strategy. I look for what I perceive to be mistakes in price vs value in the market. If you have an interest in managing your own money over time, you&#x27;ll likely gradually learn to lean into what you&#x27;re good at.<p>I&#x27;d recommend a few introduction level books, from the perspective of my bias:<p>Buffett: The Making of an American Capitalist, by Roger Lowenstein. Not primarily to learn about Buffett, rather, to learn about the concept of value as it pertains to investing.<p>Business Adventures: Twelve Classic Tales from the World of Wall Street, by John Brooks.<p>The Little Book That Still Beats the Market, by Joel Greenblatt.<p>Margin of Safety, by Seth Klarman. This book is excellent, however it has been out of print for some time. You may be able to find a copy of it somewhere though (there have often been PDFs of it floating around).<p>Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits, by Philip Fisher.<p>Peter Lynch has a few worthwhile books as well. Some of this will seem out of date, it&#x27;s not. The lessons are eternal.<p>A lot of people will jump to recommending The Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham, I absolutely do not recommend his books for anyone new to investing. They&#x27;re extremely dense, even for an average investor with years of experience.<p>I&#x27;d read this article by Warren Buffett from 1984 (The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville):<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www8.gsb.columbia.edu&#x2F;articles&#x2F;columbia-business&#x2F;superinvestors\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www8.gsb.columbia.edu&#x2F;articles&#x2F;columbia-business&#x2F;sup...<\/a><p>There is always a wave of people that come around during the heady days in markets, proclaiming that value investing doesn&#x27;t work, that markets are too efficient or the like. In the 1984 article (linked above) by Buffett, he references this as well, it was being argued to be an out-of-date approach just the same four decades ago; one might be inclined to question the authors of those arguments for what they&#x27;re revealing about their particular interests. That&#x27;s all bunk. I made a killing buying in March during the brief crash, by doing nothing more than specifically taking advantage of the sudden and considerable price vs value discounts that were made available (like Square trading for a mere three to four times sales; a belligerent discount vs their growth and potential), an inefficiency event in the market. It&#x27;s down to being able to stand apart from the emotional crowd and make your own determinations about value. The approach will always work, and it applies to everything we do economically throughout life, not just investing in stocks."],"time":["2020-09-21 17:18:47"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["andreasmiller98"],"id":[24543188],"kids":{},"parent":[24539605],"text":["AlleAktien.de for high quality stock research and insights — its in German, however"],"time":["2020-09-21 15:33:55"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["JacKTrocinskI"],"id":[24540881],"kids":[24541728],"parent":[24539605],"text":["Open a Roth IRA, max out your yearly contributions and invest out of that.

Owning a diversified stock portfolio and holding is generally considered a safe long term strategy because stocks tend to trend upward and you can regain losses caused by bear markets by holding until times are good again.<p>If you want to be a passive investor then invest in ETFs like SPY or QQQ that have a lot of liquidity and represent a basket of stocks than will tend to trend upwards.<p>If you want to have more fun and take on more risk than some of the older guys on here then learn about options trading and hedging strategies which can really increase (or decrease) your YoY returns.

It explains how to convert screenshot and video capture provided by DOSBox into web-oriented formats, with some welcome considerations about pixel aspect ratio.  This is a good basis!<p>&gt; but in these screenshots we want to retain the crisp and jagged edges that is typical of DOSBox and the old CRT monitors. Therefore we use the -sample option that does not introduce any new colours. Instead it uses nearest-neighbour interpolation (point sampling) to decide the colours of the scaled image.<p>There are 2 ironic things:<p>* modern world drifts away from pixel-to-pixel rendering, and indeed the web page presenting the captures constrains it (img in a div in a main with max-width:42em. So, web viewing does introduce some smoothing<p>* the CRTs-based screens of the days were not that crisp! Especially the color ones, they had a &quot;shadow mask&quot;, a grid of RGB spots which had no reason to be aligned with the pixel locations (this is explained e.g. on &quot;How Analog Color TV Works: The Beginnings&quot; by &quot;Technology Connections&quot; <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=dX649lnKAU0\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=dX649lnKAU0<\/a> or jump straight to <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;dX649lnKAU0?t=576\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;dX649lnKAU0?t=576<\/a> for explanations and <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;dX649lnKAU0?t=665\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;dX649lnKAU0?t=665<\/a> for close-to-screen example )<p>&gt; The screenshots obtained in this manner have an aspect ratio of 8:5 which makes the output look stretched horizontally.<p>Because modern format and&#x2F;or modern displaying program tend to assume square pixels, which originals were not.  Same issue on Amiga (pixel aspect ratio was even different on North-American Amigas and European Amigas) and many others, until VGA then LCD with digital links became established.  Consider older CGA&#x2F;EGA PCs. You mechanically can&#x27;t fit 640x350 640x400 640x480 640x512 pixels on the same 4:3 area and still get square pixels in all cases.  Some machines had border, which somehow can help, but in a number of cases, e.g. the Amstrad CPC, users didn&#x27;t notice much but the pixels were still not squares!<p>&gt; The old CRT computer monitors for which these old DOS programs were written had an aspect ratio of 4:3 instead. This stretched look can be fixed by resizing the images to an aspect ratio of 4:3.<p>The intention is right. Some people don&#x27;t even notice extremely wrong aspect ratio, the author and I do.<p>Still, I agree the PNGs of this article are good as &quot;pristine capture format&quot;.<p>The job that the author does to restore aspect ratio is based on repeating the lines and columns. This causes another effect: even programs (e.g. web browser showing that page) that try to do decent job of interpolating will blur some lines and not others, which IMHO adds an unpleasant effect reminiscent of what some LCD screen do when upscaling: they display some positions as is and blur some others.<p>I consider aspect ratio to be important along with uniform (fair) treatment when adjusting size to modern displays. I&#x27;m okay with sacrificing a crispness that does only mathematically existed anyway. You are allowed disagree with me.<p>As a conclusion, surprisingly enough, I would keep the 1:1 PNG as pristine capture format, and post upscaled versions <i>with<\/i> interpolation to get correct aspect ratio and fair rendering a bit like CRT did."],"time":["2020-09-21 10:23:41"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["lucideer"],"id":[24544566],"kids":[24544720,24545616],"parent":[24543871],"text":["Might be just me, but (having never used this &quot;Data Crayon&quot; website before) the page text content doesn&#x27;t seem to display for me.<p>I see a table of contents, and an interactive chord diagram, but none of the links in the ToC work (I see no Preamble&#x2F;Introduction&#x2F;etc.)<p>Have tried every browser on my system..."],"time":["2020-09-21 17:31:07"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jacknews"],"id":[24544691],"kids":{},"parent":[24543871],"text":["No Ethiopia, arguably the origin of coffee?"],"time":["2020-09-21 17:42:49"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["fungifam"],"id":[24546105],"kids":[24546354,24546811],"parent":[24545014],"text":["“Simple blog”... install node.js and Angular to get started.

Banks don&#x27;t just <i>know<\/i> that a transaction is indicative of illegal activity. A regular part of my job was debating with my coworkers about whether we should be concerned by some transactional pattern. More than once I followed bank policy and flagged activity conducted by wealthy people that turned out to be completely legal.

A classic example is Paul Manafort&#x27;s activity with the Bank of Cyprus. BoC compliance officers questioned Manafort about some of his activity, at which point he immediately stopped transacting through the bank. This is obviously anathema to law enforcement, who would prefer not to alert their targets.<p>All of this is to say: AML policy in the U.S. is a big mess, and even though it&#x27;s meaningful work, I&#x27;m glad I got out of it.

The height of irony in The Social Dilemma was the shot where LinkedIn and Google (separately from YouTube, which is fair game IMO) were listed among these evil addictive technologies and somehow Netflix, a pioneer of autoplay and binge watching, didn&#x27;t make the cut.<p>That aside, the insidious thing about this movie is that many of the issues in brings up are real. There are real problems with social media addiction, ad tech, and filter bubbles. Changes do need to be made. Some might even need to be forced onto the big tech companies. However, these problems are not the root of all evil, as The Social Dilemma would have us believe.<p>They are certainly not the primary cause of societal upheaval we&#x27;ve been seeing. Political polarization in the US has been rising since the 90s, well before social media became dominant. Racism and police violence have never really gone away. Blaming tech for everything both makes it harder to fix the real problems with tech and easier to ignore the problems that exist elsewhere in society.<p>Off the top of my head, some things that deserve just as much blame for the problems this movie pins on technology:<p>1. The death of the Fairness Doctrine in 1987 (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;FCC_fairness_doctrine\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;FCC_fairness_doctrine<\/a>)<p>People can see distorted views of the world without the help of social media. One can argue that even now, Fox News and other mainstream media have a greater role in shaping public opinion than social media does. Not to mention the conglomerization of local news (driven by capital rather than tech) and the nationalization of media (enabled by tech, but driven by the MSM).<p>2. The slow death of the middle class, in the US and elsewhere.<p>An underlying assumption of The Social Dilemma and its line of argument is that people are dumb and easily manipulated. I suspect the educated elite, well-represented in the movie and over-represented here on HN, are particularly succeptible to this kind of thinking, myself included. But I think the reality is that most people care about their livelihoods more than anything else, and the polarization and upheaval we&#x27;ve been seeing (from Brexit to Trump) can largely be attributed to different reactions to this erosion of the middle class. The left might attribute it to unregulated capitalism and a failing social safety net. The right might attribute it to globalization, immigration, etc. The underlying phenomenon is the same, and has very little to do with tech, unless you&#x27;re talking about factories and shipping costs.<p>3. Some problems have always been around - social media just makes everything more visible.<p>The last century saw two world wars, plenty of revolutions and armed conflict outside of that (which seems like a gross understatement, but there are too many to list), the death of the British Empire and the rise of many new nations, lots of social upheaval in the US... the list goes on. There&#x27;s plenty to say about the 21st century as well, but looking back on history, I don&#x27;t know if things have really gotten that much worse.<p>To put it differently, many on HN (myself included) love to tinker with tooling - editors, note-taking apps, what have you. But at the end of the day, we have to get back to the real work, and use those tools to accomplish meaningful things. If you look at social media and Internet technologies as tools for society, then yes, it&#x27;s valuable to scrutinize them and see how they can be improved. But at the end of the day, we also need to get out into society and get to work, with whatever tools we have at hand."],"time":["2020-09-21 00:56:15"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["holtkam2"],"id":[24538956],"kids":{},"parent":[24536929],"text":["This should be required viewing for all high school students."],"time":["2020-09-21 03:37:07"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[24538117],"kids":{},"parent":[24536929],"text":{},"time":["2020-09-21 00:54:53"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":["cm2012"],"id":[24538468],"kids":{},"parent":[24536929],"text":["Documentaries are the worst way to put forth a legitimate argument (in this case, the argument is that social media is bad).

My ears were ringing throughout the whole call. This is unacceptable. Well-engineered mute buttons on keyboards shouldn’t need to go to software, they should immediately send a signal to the motherboard’s DAC—ideally on a separate wire or connection—to say terminate this signal. Then it’s less of a concern if it takes the OS a few seconds to react to the change, because our ears have been spared.<\/i><p>&quot;Should not need to go to software?&quot;  I&#x27;m not sure.<p>I have a Yamaha AV receiver on my desk. The huge volume knob has the best user experience than any software-based solution, unlike menus or hotkeys, it&#x27;s always in my reach and instantaneously responses to my inputs. It has smooth mechanical damping, giving a satisfying touch and feel. I can immediately turn the volume down in a second if there&#x27;s misbehaving, non-normalized loud audio. I did it from time to time.<p>On the other hand, I clearly know it&#x27;s software-driven. The knob is nothing but an user interface. It&#x27;s an optical rotary encoder, not a real potentiometer. When the knob is turned, it chops a beam of light, and an optical sensor converts the optical pulse to a digital signal, which is then sent to a GPIO pin on the application processor in the AV receiver. The firmware on the application processor receives an IRQ, then commands the DAC via the system bus (could be I2C) to increase or decrease the volume in a 0.5 dB step. It&#x27;s 100% software driven, not hardware driven. The software can fail, yet the software never let me down.<p>We can get another conclusion from this: Special-purpose computing is more reliable than general-purpose computing. The operating system handles everything, and has numerous failure modes due to its unpredictability. Furthermore, it&#x27;s in a constant state of change to bring the &quot;Next Great Things&quot;, who cares if the audio mixer or the TouchBar becomes a bit slow?
