If you want to migrate away from the mess and headache that is Python. Within deep learning, I have a preference for NLP. However I also have experience with image and video related workflows. However that usually comes with some ethics ramifications, discussed below.<p>Ethics: I will not work on generic &quot;body pose&quot; or &quot;image classification&quot; problems. I have in my past found that work I do on these would end up being used in unsavoury places. The more ethically prickly your area of interest is, the more I will ask for in remuneration. e.g. if you are in the gambling or ad industry seeking ML work, I will ask for a significantly more than if your product boosts local industry.<p>Brief About Me: I wrote Gorgonia, which is like TensorFlow and PyTorch out of frustration from working with Theano. Since then I have deployed more than 100 ML systems using Gorgonia into production as both a private consultant and an employee to a corporation. I mainly do the former in a capacity to move mature implementations to a less messy less frustrating codebase. I&#x27;ve worked across industries, and led teams.<p>I enjoy working on hard problems, enjoy thinking about them and giving talks about various interesting ideas. Some of my talks can be found here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;chewxy&#x2F;status&#x2F;1160704487872294913\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;chewxy&#x2F;status&#x2F;1160704487872294913<\/a><p>Unfortunately, these are currently hard to get due to time commitment issues (the pandemic has somewhat shifted my focus to family).

We recently got notified that our most recent project funding dried up and the office is being closed. I’ve been at it for over a decade, and what hurts me the most is seeing teams like this disbanded that are so rare and hard to find. In the past we have had success building production b2c and b2b services. I’d like to see our team continue and be hired on to a new exciting project to achieve that success again. If you’re looking to hire an engineering team, and you’d like to get to work asap and skip the recruiter fees, you may strike gold speaking with me.<p>We are all self motivated professionals who really enjoy what we do and have years of experience building scalable backends and front end user interfaces on the Web, iOS and Android. Our past projects have been very challenging, often involving complex hardware pairing with software; I’m confident we can take on just about anything.<p>We take pride in clean, documented and commented repositories. PR reviews, linting and proper git foo are part of our culture, as well as consistent agile development processes.<p>Some details of our expertise:<p>Backend: We are heavy AWS users, deploying serverless stacks via cloud formation. In our last project, we were using DynamoDB, Lambda, Elastic Search, AppSync, SQS, S3, IoT, Cognito, Route 53, EC2 and a number of other services. Our serverless stack is built on a monorepo, written in both Typescript and Python, that is deployed to multiple stages to facilitate development all the way to production. This stack includes a GraphQL interface for all clients to communicate via AppSync. We have integration tests and unit tests as well as a built in CLI to handle smoke tests and common operations.  We recently participated in AWS REINVENT 2019.<p>Web front end: Our most recent project is built using Typescript, React, Nextjs, Apollo, Formiq, and deployed to the serverless hosting solution Vercel (formerly Now). There are multiple apps split in a monorepo, setup with stage deployment via CI, nearly 100% component test coverage, and developed using vscode and its awesome debugger.<p>Android &amp; iOS:  Apps built 100% in Swift and Kotlin, using AppSync to communicate with GraphQL and handling on device state management for offline queries and mutations. We have experience pairing mobile apps with hardware via wifi and bluetooth which represents many challenges we are familiar with.<p>UI&#x2F;UX: We have expertise in developing both Web and Mobile UI&#x2F;UX, user driven workflows and using tools such as Sketch, Zeplin and Abstract.

If you have interrupt priorities then you can treat your interrupt service routines as the highest priority tasks. As an example lets imagine a drone controller which has two functions it needs to perform in real time: it needs to vary the PWM signal to the motor controller and it needs to acknowledge radio packets. An interrupt is raised when the accelerometer has new data and another is raised when the radio has received a packet. You could write ISRs which just queues the accelerometer data and radio packets so they can be dealt with by a flight control task and a radio task respectively. Alternatively, you could run the whole of the flight controller inside the accelerometer ISR. This reduces copying of data and context switches. Because the accelerometer ISR now takes longer you need to use the radio ISR to acknowledge the radio packets itself. You split the radio task into two tasks: a low priority task for processing commands and the ISR task which does the acknowledgements.<p>&gt; Avoid blocking function calls<p>This can be rewritten as never call functions that block on an action of a lower priority task. It leads to priority inversion in normal tasks and deadlocks in ISRs."],"time":["2020-06-01 14:42:45"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["roland35"],"id":[23379683],"kids":[23382122,23382023],"parent":[23376960],"text":["This is a great list of some basic rules of thumb! Over the years I have encountered many of these in practice.<p>I think it is important as engineers to always try and keep an eye on the big picture. Many times it is easy to get bogged down in an interesting technical problem in embedded engineering, and we can forget how that problem fits in with the overall state of the project. One example was I found that I could not send more than 1 USB bulk packet per millisecond using Texas Instruments&#x27; USB library, even though in theory you could send 19 per millisecond. I wasted a few days to try and fix that, but it was a waste of time because speeding up USB only sped up firmware updates which were not a big deal! There are many examples like this unfortunately.<p>I think the biggest thing missing from this list is how important it is to thoughtfully design the hardware to make the firmware easier to design. This requires a less agile approach, or more flexible prototype hardware until requirements are better understood.  Just one example is using separate SPI&#x2F;I2C busses for separate peripherals, even though technically they can be shared.

However, I was disappointed to not see any mentions of Iain M. Banks&#x27;s Culture universe, which means it misses out on what I think is the most novel approach to spaceship design in literature.<p>First, The Culture&#x27;s spaceships are enormous. The largest type we encounter, the General Systems Vehicle, is 200 km long and can house up to 6 billion people; while these serve as habitats for a civilian population, these are still spaceships, capable of moving at great speed.<p>Secondly, the ships have no physical hull. Instead, their structure is maintained by field manipulation. Banks doesn&#x27;t go deeper into how this works, but it&#x27;s clear The Culture has technology to manipulate physical reality similar to classic science fiction &quot;force fields&quot; that allows ships to maintain an atmosphere and protect against physical damage. Notably, in several books, the ships modify both their interior and exterior structure while traveling in order to optimize themselves for some purpose.<p>Thirdly, an important part of The Culture is that the ships are, in a sense, alive. The Minds, which are the AIs that control them are largely inseparable from the ships they inhabit. Clearly we&#x27;ve had AI-controlled ships before (HAL, Alien&#x27;s Mother, and so on), but these have always been subservient to humans. With The Culture, a human boarding a ship is a guest of the Mind, and ships don&#x27;t have captains or comamnders.

Want to be a part of IKEA? Not a public company? The Mars Group, who sell most candies worldwide? They are also doing great. LEGO? Nope.<p>Okay, so you have investors - pensions funds, private individuals and many others - who want to invest, and gain returns on their money. So why do they invest in no -profitable companies?

College gives you an opportunity to explore who you are and what you care about in an environment largely  free of external stress (yes I know there can be stress but it&#x27;s generally a lot different than &quot;I need to provide for my family&quot;). A lot of people are super confident in what they think their life path is until they actually encounter the steps it takes to get there. Generally we do a pretty poor job of educating young people on what different careers actually look like and what it takes to get there.

If I had bypassed college and just started working to get to one of those paths I saw for myself who knows where I&#x27;d be.

It is clear there are too many people going to University. It has become a status symbol, driven partly by the baby boomers who just seem to like the idea of their kids going to University, and who are wealthy enough that their kids (of which I am one) are happy to swan about getting educated for 3 - 8 years. My father&#x27;s experience was very different. He was actively criticised in his family for wanting to go to University, and had to get up at 4am to haul fruit crates to pay his way. His brother who went and got a job straight out of school was considered the smart one. Nevermind that the brother later went to University and became a lecturer, which comes to my next point.<p>When I was in University, I didn&#x27;t really appreciate that it is mainly about cachet. Yes there are great experiences, you meet great people, you can be inspired, it opens your mind, you can do great work, but the thing that gets people in the door, and the thing that Universities are primarily selling, is cachet. It&#x27;s interesting seeing how Covid19 interacts with this. Lots of people must be worried that their university cachet will be tainted by pandemic restrictions if they are the in the &#x27;class of 2020&#x27;. This could be one reason for the massive number of students deferring.<p>So if the cachet matters to you (and your future employers), yes you should defintiely go to University, there is no substitute. There are also some jobs you can&#x27;t do, or even really comprehend, unless you go to University (medicine, dentistry, civil&#x2F;mechanical&#x2F;electrical&#x2F;aerospace&#x2F;chemical&#x2F;environmental engineering).

Debugging an unsuccessful locking in the CI of an enterprise project is a mystery that could take an entire week to solve.\nIts javascript counter-part (npm) does the exact same thing, faster and with less CPU usage.<p>Trusting the OS community, I understand that there would be very good reasons for Pipenv to perform like this, but as the consumer of a package managing tool all I see is the same generation of file hashes I see on npm, but with npm doing it way more efficiently.

Project Beacon<p>The establishment of Project Beacon followed a number of shooting incidents involving the use of firearms by the Victoria police. Between 1987 and 1994, officers were involved in operational incidents which resulted in the deaths of 29 offenders or suspects. Police were required to attend 15 to 20 incidents per day where use of force was employed and up to three &quot;critical incidents&quot; per week. A critical incident is defined as &quot;any incident requiring police management which involves violence or a threat of violence and is, or is potentially, life-threatening&quot;. By mid-1994 this trend became the catalyst for fundamental change in operational safety tactics and training within the Victoria police. Expert analysis revealed that a number of factors may have contributed to this increase; namely, a feeling of vulnerability within the police force, a desire on the part of the community for instant solutions and a belief within the force that &quot;there was no one else to solve these problems&quot;.<p>It was also felt that this trend was in part contributed to by the de-institutionalisation of patients with mental illness in Victoria in the early 1990s. Six of nine fatal shooting incidents in 1994 by police (and one in 1995) involved persons with a mental illness. Statistics revealed that such persons were involved in 44% of all critical incidents reported to Project Beacon between October, 1994 and December, 1995. It was further noted that persons with mental illness were involved in approximately 4% of all &quot;use of force&quot; incidents, i.e., where force is used or threatened by or against the police. Emotionally disturbed persons attempting suicide and&#x2F;or self-mutilation constituted a further 3.5% of use of force incidents. In general, a significant number of emotionally disturbed persons and people with behavioural problems, who may not have had histories of mental illness, regularly came to the police attention.<p>A number of reviews, both internal and with the assistance of international policing experts, were undertaken in an attempt to identify solutions. On 6th April, 1994, the Commissioner of the Victoria police, Mr. Neil Comrie, wrote to all commissioned officers emphasising the philosophy that &quot;the success of an operation will primarily be judged by the extent to which the use of force is avoided or minimised&quot;.<p>On 19th September, 1994, Project Beacon was established and involved the standardisation of training so that all officers were trained to the same level of competence. The core principles of Project Beacon inform the response to every incident and the planning of operations which may involve any potential use of force. These core principles may be summarised as follows:<p>* &quot;Safety First — the safety of police, the public and the offender or suspect is paramount.<p>* Risk Assessment — is to be applied to all incidents and operations.<p>* Take Charge — effective command and control must be exercised.<p>* Planned Response — every opportunity should be taken to convert an unplanned response into a planned operation.<p>* Cordon and Containment — unless impractical, a cordon and containment approach is to be adopted.<p>* Avoid Confrontation — a violent confrontation is to be avoided.<p>* Avoid Force — the use of force is to be avoided.<p>* Minimum Force — where the use of force is to be avoided, only the minimum amount reasonably necessary is to be used.<p>* Forced Entry Searches — are to be used only as a last resort.<p>* Resources — it is accepted that the &quot;safety first&quot; principle may require the deployment of more resources, more complex planning and more time to complete&quot;.<p>The primary principle of Project Beacon is &quot;safety first&quot;. The safety of the police officer is paramount, followed by the safety of the public and the safety of the subject. Mr. Shuey utilised the example of a doctor attending a collision to treat a patient: &quot;the doctor wouldn’t stand in the middle of the road to do the treatment of the patient because he would be exposing himself to the risk of being run over by a car&quot;. If the police officer is in a position of security, he or she will be more competent and capable of handling the situation. If a police officer is not involved in anything which is unsafe, he will have a clearer perspective of what is happening and be able to deal with the situation accordingly. If you expose a police officer to a &quot;kill or be killed&quot; situation, the risk of a fatal confrontation increases.<p>A significant objective of Project Beacon was to assist police in dealing with persons with mental illness, emotionally disturbed individuals and persons with behavioural problems. Project Beacon, in collaboration with the Victoria Department of Health and Community Services, developed a comprehensive integrated approach for dealing with such persons which was incorporated into police training courses. The training involved video scenarios and role-playing and in December, 1995, a video called &quot;Similar Expectations&quot; was produced. It offered a range of methods for dealing with persons with mental illness, and provided advice from mental health experts. The video received widespread acceptance in law enforcement and mental health agencies and was automatically incorporated into every police officer’s training; it was not confined to the training of those who participated in dedicated negotiators courses. Further training programmes were developed by persons with expertise in psychiatric mental health with the assistance of a police psychologist.<p>8,500 police officers, student and operational, were placed on an initial, five day training course complemented by mandatory two-day refresher training every six months. It is now part of ongoing training of police officers in the state of Victoria. Training for the Special Operations Group is rigorous and ongoing, taking place on most occasions when its members are not involved in operational response duties.<p>A &quot;use of force register&quot; is now maintained by the Victoria Police. Use of force incidents range from the forcible obtainment of fingerprints and handcuffing, through to riot situations. All such incidents are recorded in the register. This enables the police force in Victoria to track the number of incidents where force is a factor, and enables trend analysis in relation to the type of force and weapons that are used. This acts as a &quot;catalyst&quot; for the next six months of training. The information is analysed and if there is an excessive increase in crimes involving firearms or knives etc., the training in the following six months will be highlighted in that direction."],"time":["2020-06-01 11:07:27"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["tonyedgecombe"],"id":[23376615],"kids":[23376710,23376648,23376646,23376731,23376697,23377211,23376671,23376658,23376649],"parent":[23376188],"text":["<i>Police killed 1,099 people in 2019.<\/i><p>As a contrast 3 people died at the hands of the police in the UK in 2019."],"time":["2020-06-01 11:12:54"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["longtermdd"],"id":[23376547],"kids":{},"parent":[23376188],"text":["I really love how, in 2020, with every bigger news event there are 100s of startups or mapping tools trying to squeeze in.

My experience as a reddit moderator has been that users break down into 4 groups:<p>1. Normal people that mostly follow the rules.  This is BY FAR the largest group, and they&#x27;re usually great.  Transparency benefits them most: once they know what they did wrong, usually they won&#x27;t do it again.  Some even admit they deserved penalties or short bans -- although a few will defend their actions.<p>2. Jerks: people who contribute constructively sometimes but also cause a lot of drama. If moderators don&#x27;t show clearly where they broke a rule, usually they&#x27;re going to protest that they did nothing wrong.  Providing transparency saves moderator effort because it avoids some of this back-and-forth.  Sometimes.  These are almost inevitably the people that claim mods were &quot;abusing their powers&quot; when they get banned for obvious things (swearing at people, posting self-promotional content, etc).<p>3. Dedicated trolls who go out of their way to break rules and cause trouble.  They are relatively rare but as a moderator  really the only thing you can do is ban them. Transparency won&#x27;t make a difference one way or another, but it can be hard to tell a jerk from a dedicated troll at times so you&#x27;re better off citing specific violations.<p>4. Spammers &amp; obvious bots. With the right defenses (automoderator rules, spam filter, etc) most of these can be handled with minimum human effort.  Without these defenses, spammers&#x2F;bots can flood you pretty quickly.  Transparency is irrelevant here.<p>FWIW I <i>always<\/i> provide a reason when issuing a ban (citing the rule broken and where they did it)."],"time":["2020-06-01 22:12:02"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["benjaminjosephw"],"id":[23376835],"kids":[23377960],"parent":[23376208],"text":["I wonder whether there&#x27;s a membership size threshold where, after crossing that tipping point, the community implicitly looses some degree of transparency whatever the moderation rules are.

A Highlander of my acquaintance who came to pass the winter in Dresden spent the first few days of his residence there in arguing this question with the Saxon Government.  They asked him what he was doing in those clothes.  He was not an amiable man.  He answered, he was wearing them.  They asked him why he was wearing them.  He replied, to keep himself warm.  They told him frankly that they did not believe him, and sent him back to his lodgings in a closed landau.  The personal testimony of the English Minister was necessary to assure the authorities that the Highland garb was the customary dress of many respectable, law-abiding British subjects.  They accepted the statement, as diplomatically bound, but retain their private opinion to this day.
