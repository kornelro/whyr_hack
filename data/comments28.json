Any time any of the consumers would slow down of fail, rabbit would run out of memory and crash, causing sitewide failure.<p>Additionally, Rabbit would invent network partitions out of thin air, which would cause it to lose messages, as when partitions are healed, all messages on an arbitrarily chosen side of the partition are discarded. (See <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aphyr.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;315-jepsen-rabbitmq\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aphyr.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;315-jepsen-rabbitmq<\/a> for more details about Rabbit&#x27;s issues and some recommendations for running Rabbit, which sound worse than just using something else to me.)<p>We experimented with &quot;high availability&quot; mode, which caused the cluster to crash more frequently and lose more messages, &quot;durability&quot;, which caused the cluster to crash more frequently and lose more messages, and trying to colocate all of our Rabbit nodes on the same rack (which did not fix the constant partitions, and caused us to totally fail when this rack lost power, as you&#x27;d expect.)<p>These are not theoretical problems. At one point, I spent an entire night fighting with this stupid thing alongside 4 other competent infrastructure engineers. The only long term solution that we found was to completely deprecate our use of Rabbit and use Kafka instead.<p>To anyone considering Rabbit, please reconsider! If you&#x27;re OK with losing messages, then simply making an asynchronous fire-and-forget RPC directly to the relevant consumers may be a better solution for you, since at least there isn&#x27;t more infrastructure to maintain."],"time":["2020-05-22 03:57:53"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["wegs"],"id":[23259960],"kids":[23261769,23265707,23268465,23268546],"parent":[23258301],"text":["My general problem is that it&#x27;s really hard to figure out which architecture is right for which system.<p>There&#x27;s a different architecture for:<p>* one queue with billions of messages<p>* a millions of queues with small numbers of messages per queue<p>* many queues with many messages per queue<p>There are also different topologies:<p>* Anyone can send a message to anyone (O(n^2) queues)<p>* One publisher with millions of subscribers<p>* One subscribed with millions of publishers<p>* Complex processing networks, where messages get routed in complex ways between processing nodes.<p>There are differences in timing:<p>* More-or-less instant push notifications<p>* Jobs which run within e.g. 5 minutes with polling<p>* Jobs which run in hours&#x2F;days, with a cron-style architecture<p>And in reliability:<p>* Messages get delivered 100% of the time, and archived once delivered<p>* Messages get delivered 99.999% of the time, but might be dropped on a system outage<p>* ... all the way down to ephemeral pub-subs<p>... and so on.<p>I&#x27;d give my VP&#x27;s right eye to get a nice chart of what supports what.

If you have large messages and use keepalives (and you&#x27;ll need keepalives), you need to write your own message fragmentation.<p>2. There are no python libs that just work.

This doesn&#x27;t seem to result in message loss. I&#x27;ve dealt with this by just running LOTS of concurrent connections, and aggregating them client side. This has worked fine.<p>4. In general, exactly-once delivery isn&#x27;t a thing. You should design either for at-most-once, or at-least-once delivery modes exclusively. Idempotency is your friend.<p>5.

Overall I found it to be more difficult than I would have wanted to get simple things to work. Part of this seems to be a problem with the Java library, which is not great. For example, IIRC you have to be really careful not to create the same queue twice, even with identical configurations, since the second time something blows up. At the end of the day just a simple fan-out configuration ends up involving a lot of somewhat-intricate code. It definitely does not Just Work (TM).<p>And then there was the bizarre hangs that I would experience during testing. I set up a Docker Compose configuration so that I could test the various parts of the system independently. It included one container running RabbitMQ to simulate the cluster we have running on our cloud.<p>Usually tests ran fine. But then, from time to time, the client would just hang trying to send a message through RabbitMQ. Unfortunately, again, the code you need to just run a basic configuration using RabbitMQ is complex enough that at first I was pretty sure that I had done something wrong. But after a few hours of increasing frustration I finally broke down and discovered that a simple test case that just sent a single message using code torn right out of the docs would hang. Forever. (Or, long enough that I gave up waiting.)<p>After a lot of digging I found the culprit. RabbitMQ will just take its ball and go home if the broker doesn&#x27;t have enough disk space. Given that I use Docker heavily for a lot of projects, the amount available to new containers would vary a lot depending on what other data sets I had loaded or how recently I had run docker system prune.<p>I filed an issue about this, asking to have a better error message displayed when an attempt to send a message was made. The response was: there&#x27;s already an error message, printed during startup. You didn&#x27;t see it? No. I must have missed it among the hundreds of other lines of output that RabbitMQ spews when it starts.<p>Overall my favorite part of this story is that RabbitMQ chooses to start but refuse to send messages when low on disk space, when just crashing would be much more useful and make it much easier to pinpoint what was going on.<p>Anyway, I&#x27;m in the market for a simpler alternative that&#x27;s Kotlin friendly."],"time":["2020-05-22 02:45:55"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["rawoke083600"],"id":[23263262],"kids":{},"parent":[23258301],"text":["Man I love this piece of software..

But in the latter case, as we saw with New Jersey&#x27;s unemployment system, that &quot;reliability&quot; was fragile and contingent on the current state of affairs, and had no hope of withstanding a sudden shift in usage patterns.<p>Now we have various organizations - governmental and otherwise - hastily setting up online versions of essential services and it seems like every single one of them breaks on arrival.<p>We need some sort of standard for software engineering quality. I don&#x27;t think this is an academic question anymore. Real people&#x27;s lives are being impacted every day now by shoddy software, and with the current crisis they often have no alternative. Software that you or I could probably have executed better, but that the people who were hired to do it either a) couldn&#x27;t, or b) didn&#x27;t bother. It&#x27;s nearly impossible for non-technical decision makers in these orgs to evaluate the quality of the systems they&#x27;ve hired people to build. We need quality assurance at an institutional level.<p>If not governmental, maybe an organization around this could be made by developers themselves. Not the &quot;certified for $technology&quot; certifications we have now, but a certification of fundamental software engineering skills and principles. A certification you can lose if you do something colossally irresponsible. At the end of the day, this dilution of quality is having a negative impact on our job field, so it concerns all of us. It leads to technical debt, micro-management, excessively rigid deadlines and requirements, which we all have to deal with.

In the UI, websockets are grouped under the &quot;xhr&quot; column[1].<p>I&#x27;m a pretty big Javascript advocate, but I do recommend advanced users run uMatrix and consider disabling at least 3rd-party JS by default. uMatrix is a fantastic tool and it really doesn&#x27;t take long to get used to. And honestly, a relatively large portion of the web works with only 1st party Javascript, and a surprising chunk of the web still works just fine with no Javascript at all.<p>This is also why I advise advanced users to run Firefox. uMatrix isn&#x27;t available for Safari, and it&#x27;s looking extremely likely that it&#x27;ll be at least underpowered in Chrome once Manifest v3 comes out. Or I guess run Brave or Vivaldi or whatever. Dang kids running around with their hipster browsers, I can&#x27;t keep track of them all.<p>The point is, even though I&#x27;m extremely bullish on the web as a secure application platform, part of the reason I&#x27;m bullish is because the web makes it relatively easy to take simple security measures like disabling scripts by default. You should absolutely take advantage of that, you should absolutely be disabling at least some Javascript features when you browse.<p>You can even globally turn off fingerprinting vectors like WebGL[2]&#x2F;Canvas[3] in Firefox, and just swap to a different profile whenever you want to visit the rare game&#x2F;app that requires them. Although with more and more people trying to embed their own DOM models in Canvas, maybe that&#x27;ll be harder in the future.<p>[0]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;gorhill&#x2F;uMatrix\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;gorhill&#x2F;uMatrix<\/a><p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;gorhill&#x2F;uMatrix&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The-popup-panel#the-type-cells\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;gorhill&#x2F;uMatrix&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The-popup-panel#the-...<\/a><p>[2]: about:config -&gt; `webgl.disabled` -&gt; true<p>[3]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bugzilla.mozilla.org&#x2F;show_bug.cgi?id=967895\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bugzilla.mozilla.org&#x2F;show_bug.cgi?id=967895<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-21 20:53:51"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["enkrs"],"id":[23264671],"kids":[23265226,23265964,23268205,23268479],"parent":[23256458],"text":["Given the news this has made, I sure hope browser vendors don&#x27;t overreact with blocking this too hard:<p>I genuinely have a use-case for this.

With a 30k population, that&#x27;s around $500m dollars with research overhead?<p>One goal (among others) is to show how the money improves the local economy and gets earned back by the government &#x2F; taxes, since that is a significant part of UBI&#x27;s way of paying for itself.<p>2) Create a more robust policy for paying for it.<p>I want a document that is 50-300 pages long and covers EVERYTHING I can think of, like, 1) what exactly is excluded in the VAT tax? 2) Charts of consumption levels and how much you&#x27;ll end up paying, with examples of actors at each level. 3) How much does Amazon, Facebook, Google, etc, actually pay for UBI? 4) What is the breakdown of where UBI money comes from in the economy? 5) What are contingency plans for if we have a deficit? Print money? Loan? 6) What are the contingency plans for if we have a permanent deficit, year over year? Inflation?<p>3) Find out the answer to the harder questions truthfully.

The harder questions are things like &quot;What % of people will spend their UBI on drugs and alcohol?&quot;<p>You don&#x27;t want to just brush aside the hard questions and treat them like roadblocks.

During the 2000’s if you were doing a “hard” tech company, investors did not have the patience to invest in these companies and allow them to grow.   I worked at several of these startups, many with big VC names you’d recognize and they killed these companies with their short term focus.<p>Later in that decade with the success of Facebook, investors turned away from these investments and were more interested in finding the next Facebook.   Essentially the 2000’s were a kind of lost decade in fundamental technology development.   Most of what was built during the decade was the benefactor of cheap computing enabled by 50 years and trillions of dollars in semiconductor investment.  Now that we are hitting the edge of what’s possible, it’s time for big, long term, hard tech investment.<p>It’s only been more recently where people like Elon Musk and to a lesser extent Larry Page at Alphabet have led the way by  being willing to take big bets on technology development.   In the last several years, we are finally starting to see some venture capital follow where investors are taking a long view and betting on a few “moonshots.”  In the last couple years there have been big investments in computing with companies like Cerebrus doing wafer scale computing, PsiQuantum and Rigetti in quantum computing, and various optical computing companies to name a few.   Of course, there has also been considerable investment in the AV space as well and the AV space will need lower power, cheaper solutions that you won’t be able to simply buy off the shelf and slap together like almost all of the AV companies are doing today."],"time":["2020-05-21 16:04:39"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["andiamo"],"id":[23255807],"kids":[23256140],"parent":[23246672],"text":["I have a different take on this: corporate research labs died because we aggressively clamped down on monopolies.<p>When you don&#x27;t have a monopoly, the investor mindset is that the company should be laser-focused on &quot;core competencies&quot; (buzzword, but important) and return excess capital to shareholders - who then provide it to other companies that will innovate in the field.

I love doing research.  But I fear losing my job, partly because I don&#x27;t know where I&#x27;d find another research position in light of the 30-year decline of industrial research combined with the impending budget cuts that will hit academia starting with this upcoming school year.<p>I&#x27;ve noticed a profound shift in the past decade away from corporate research labs such as IBM Labs and HP Labs where they worked on medium-term projects developing research prototypes that were sometimes passed onto product teams.  In their place, companies such as Google have pioneered a different model of research (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;research.google&#x2F;pubs&#x2F;pub38149&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;research.google&#x2F;pubs&#x2F;pub38149&#x2F;<\/a>), where PhDs are hired as software engineers who solve research problems and write production code, focusing more on shipping production code rather than writing papers (although there have been many great papers that have come out of Google, most notably the MapReduce and Spanner papers).  I&#x27;m noticing that the vast majority of my PhD-holding friends in computer science are hired as software engineers rather than as researchers.  The ones who started out at places like IBM Labs or HP Labs with the titles &quot;Members of Technical Staff&quot; would often end up taking positions at other companies as software engineers.<p>This development may be fine for researchers who want to work on production code and who don&#x27;t mind de-emphasizing publishing in exchange of product development.  However, what about researchers who want to focus on solving research problems that cannot immediately be applied to products?  I&#x27;m finding that there&#x27;s decreasing room for these types of researchers in this economy.  More companies have a short-term mindset these days, partly due to changes in management style (e.g., the rise of Carly Fiorina-style CEOs), but also due to the fact that the computer industry has shown repeatedly that large 800-pound gorillas can be taken down by smaller companies.  &quot;Why invest in long-term research and long-term planning if there is no guarantee of a long-term future&quot; is the logic of many companies, big and small.  The alternative to industry is academia, but there are only so many professorships available, and for those professors, there is only so much NSF grant money to go around, which is highly competitive to earn.  Professors at research universities spend a lot of time fundraising; it costs a lot of money building and maintaining a lab that is resourceful enough to perform the research and publish the results necessary to gain tenure.<p>Short of a major cultural change where companies are encouraged to invest in research at the levels that Xerox and AT&amp;T did back in the 1970s and where we see an expansion of academia similar to the post-WWII boom (which is unlikely in the United States), the future I see for those wanting to work on problems that don&#x27;t lead to immediate productization is independent research done on a researcher&#x27;s spare time when not being engaged in &quot;money-making&quot; activity.  After all, Einstein did brilliant work while he was a patent examiner, and Yitang Zhang did amazing research while being employed as an untenured lecturer.  I would advise today&#x27;s computer science PhD students of this current reality of research employment.  If one wants to work on self-directed research projects, then that person must be willing to have a self-funded research career; all researchers need to be concerned with funding whether that funding comes in the form of a direct salary, a grant, or indirectly through the salary of an unrelated job."],"time":["2020-05-21 08:54:06"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["MattGaiser"],"id":[23255393],"kids":[23255462],"parent":[23246672],"text":["The challenge is that companies have poor track records of determining what the market will want, so how can you know what to research unless it is a better version of what you already do?<p>Companies like Intel and Nvidia and the pharma companies do that kind of research because you can reasonably guarantee that someone will want a faster chip or a better cure for a disease.<p>But beyond that, what does the market want next?

Some are enormously difficult. The fools who write the textbooks of advanced mathematics — and they are mostly clever fools — seldom take the trouble to show you how easy the easy calculations are. On the contrary, they seem to desire to impress you with their tremendous cleverness by going about it in the most difficult way.<p>Being myself a remarkably stupid fellow, I have had to unteach myself the difficulties, and now beg to present to my fellow fools the parts that are not hard. Master these thoroughly, and the rest will follow. What one fool can do, another can.&quot;<\/i><p>--<p>It made me believe I could really learn calculus by myself at age 12. After reading the first few chapters, nope. Turns out calculus is built on a foundation of algebra and geometry which I did not have until I was 16. Once I did have the foundation though, calculus became easy and mostly mechanical. But to a 12 year old, this book overpromised and underdelivered.<p>I also found the exposition a little wordy and tedious, like it was written to explain calculus to an English major. It&#x27;s the sort of book that one appreciates in retrospect after knowing the subject, but not while learning it. I discovered the most effective way for learning math is actually not by reading but to mechanically work through problems to cultivate intuitions and to develop a pattern matching schema. In doing so, one gains confidence that one can actually solve problems. Once this confidence is achieved, going back and delving into the underlying principles becomes so much more contextualized and rewarding.<p>Learning math by reading books like this is like learning to ride a bike by reading about it. You try to understand all the principles, but when you need to deploy them, you find yourself unable to execute. Much better to do it the other way around.<p>EDIT: but I want to soften that by saying that I appreciate not everyone learns this way.
