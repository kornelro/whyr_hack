Proper MBR and Windows VBR would be expected to be in place according to whether you were using NT5 (ntldr) or NT6 (bootmgr) at the time.  Plus the target bootsector(s) (each in the form of a file) will need to be available and accesible by the WindowsNT boot process.\nDesired NT5 or NT6 bootsectors can be properly placed using BOOTSECT.EXE.  The resulting bootsector can then be copied to a 512-byte binary file using a disk editor or the dd command in Linux.<p>With NTLDR you will also need NTDETECT.COM, and a BOOT.INI file which contains the bootmenu.\nBOOT.INI is a plain text file which can be edited using NOTEPAD.<p>With BOOTMGR you will also need a \\BOOT\\BCD folder&#x2F;file which contains the bootmenu.\nBCD is a binary file which can be edited using BCDEDIT.<p>Either of these Windows bootmenus is always present, but bypassed on bootup if there is only one bootentry (such as the usual single Windows default entry), or if the TIMEOUT is set for zero or too few seconds.  Adding a second entry to your already-present Windows bootmenu is what makes the menu visible upon bootup.<p>.<p>Therefore adding a bare-metal bootmine option to Windows NT5 PC&#x27;s (while simultaneously enabling the NT5 multiboot menu) is quite easy and straightforward:<p>On a regular Wxp system, copy BOOTMINE.IMG to the root of your C: volume.<p>Edit your BOOT.INI something like this:<p>[Boot Loader]<p>timeout=10<p>Default=multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)\\WINDOWS<p>[Operating Systems]<p>multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)\\WINDOWS=&quot;Windows XP&quot; &#x2F;noexecute=optin &#x2F;fastdetect<p>C:\\bootmine.img=&quot;Bootmine bootsector gaming&quot;<p>Note: for DOS reference, a C:\\bootsect.dos=&quot;DOS on FAT32 volume&quot; entry in BOOT.INI can be _conveniently_ abbreviated as simply C:\\=&quot;DOS on FAT32 volume&quot;.  IOW (on the C: volume) if the bootsector file you wish to load is named anything other than BOOTSECT.DOS, you must specifiy the filename explicitly. C:\\BOOTSECT.DOS is the filename given by Windows to the automatically saved DOS bootsector when an NT system is installed over a DOS&#x2F;W9x system, before the DOS bootsector is overwritten with an NT bootsector.<p>.<p>The equivalent bare-metal bootmine option on an NT6 system is quite easy and straightforward also, provided (using CSM if necessary) you have installed W10 on a traditional MBR-partitioned (not GPT) drive:<p>On a MBR W10 system, copy BOOTMINE.IMG to the root of your C: volume.<p>Using an administrative command prompt, BCDEDIT to add a bootmine entry:<p>bcdedit &#x2F;create &#x2F;d &quot;Bootmine bootsector gaming&quot; &#x2F;application bootsector<p>_Windows will reply with the GUID it automatically assigned to your new bootentry:<p>The entry {your-new-bootmine-guid-here} has been successfully created.<p>_use that guid to complete your new bootentry, add it to the items displayed upon bootup, and adjust the timeout with the following commands:<p>bcdedit &#x2F;set {your-new-bootmine-guid-here} device partition=c:<p>bcdedit &#x2F;set {your-new-bootmine-guid-here} path \\bootmine.img<p>bcdedit &#x2F;displayorder {your-new-bootmine-guid-here} &#x2F;addlast<p>bcdedit &#x2F;timeout 10<p>You may also need to disable Windows SecureBoot if present for a UEFI system to work, sometimes even with CSM enabled.<p>To later remove the new BCD bootentry use the following command in an administrative command prompt:<p>bcdedit &#x2F;delete {your-new-bootmine-guid-here}"],"time":["2020-05-31 21:22:25"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["yosito"],"id":[23371275],"kids":[23371443,23377976,23372352,23376842,23377084,23372594,23371592,23373206,23375649],"parent":[23370348],"text":["I see lots of people commenting that this sort of keyboard is a gimmick because it&#x27;s a waste of time to look at keys while you type. As a programmer, I get that logic. But there are times when I would 100% love a keyboard that could allow me to use different key layouts and visually see the layout. The first use-case for me is when switching language layouts. I&#x27;m tri-lingual and use different keyboard layouts to be able to type characters in other languages. But every time I switch languages, I forget where the punctuation and other symbol keys have moved to. It&#x27;s a pain in the ass to have to switch layouts just because I can&#x27;t remember where a question mark or a curly bracket is in the language I&#x27;m using. Second, occasionally do design and video editing on the side. Not often enough to memorize keyboard shortcuts like I do with programming. But especially with video editing, if you&#x27;re not using keyboard shortcuts and hunting through menus instead, the work is extremely slowed down. Lastly, games. I game from time to time, but each game I play has different controls mapped to the keyboard. I can&#x27;t usually remember more than 4 or 5 controls for the duration of a gaming session, so being able to see what&#x27;s what would make my gaming experience much more enjoyable.<p>All that being said, I&#x27;m not holding my breath for this keyboard. The design isn&#x27;t polished enough, I doubt software support for my use cases will be common any time soon, and I just don&#x27;t see hundreds of little screens being cost effective or reliable hardware.

If a client were to disconnect their websocket temporarily (e.g. put their laptop to sleep), they can be reconnected to a different process, which doesn&#x27;t have the state of their components. As a result, you&#x27;ll need some way to transfer&#x2F;persist component state between processes. This same issue will also arise during deploys--you&#x27;ll spawn new processes with your new code, but you don&#x27;t want to disrupt existing clients, so those new processes need to load existing component state from old processes. Even more subtly, this issue can occur on page load, since two requests need to be made: one to fetch the initial page and one to initiate the websocket connection. Those two requests can be sent to two different processes&#x2F;boxes.<p>- Working with existing client-side libraries, like selectize or date range pickers.

Or what if you could save those five by throwing a person near you onto the tracks; should you do it?<p>Many people feel intuitively that it would be wrong to throw that person onto the tracks, and an argument attributes this to a supposed essential difference between killing someone and deciding to let that person die.<p>I disagree. I too believe it would be wrong to throw that person onto the tracks, in real life, but not in the hypothetical trolley problems. There is no ethically significant difference between killing a person and letting the person die, if (as supposed in the trolley problems) there is no doubt that the death will occur.<p>The reason, in real life, why killing someone is ethically different from letting someone die is that real life is full of surprises: the person might not really die. If you kill him, his death is pretty certain (though not totally; just recently a man was hanged in Iran and survived). If you merely don&#x27;t take action to save him, he might survive anyway. He might jump off the track, for instance, or someone might pull him off. All sorts of things might happen. Likewise, throwing the one person onto the track might not succeed in saving the other five; how could you possibly be sure it would? You might find that you had done nothing but cause one additional death. Thus, in real life it is a good principle to avoid actively killing someone now, even if that might result in other deaths later.<p>The trolley problems invalidate the principle because of the unlikely certainty that they assume. Precisely for that reason, they are not a useful moral guide for most real situations. In general, difficult artificial moral conundrums are not very useful guides for real-life conduct. It&#x27;s much more useful to think about real situations. In the free software movement I have often decided not to propose an answer to a general question until I had some real cases to think about.<p>For real driverless cars, the trolley problem never arises: the right thing to do, whenever there is a danger of collision, is to brake as fast as possible.<p>More generally, the goal is to make sure to avoid any trolley problem.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stallman.org&#x2F;articles&#x2F;trolley-problem.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stallman.org&#x2F;articles&#x2F;trolley-problem.html<\/a>"],"time":["2020-06-01 04:26:00"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["DangitBobby"],"id":[23374522],"kids":[23377310,23376145],"parent":[23367455],"text":["I was in just such a conversation the other day, where we were discussing the implications of the second amendment with regards to tyranny in the US.

Obviously shooting innocent people is not acceptable but on the other hand they are being thrown into a bad situation and don&#x27;t get much help coping with that. I know a guy (very nice guy)  who started as a cop two years ago. Since then he had to shoot somebody in the leg who attacked him with a knife, had to deal with a teenage girl hanging herself, lots of domestic violence and a lot of other really bad stuff that&#x27;s very tough to deal with. They don&#x27;t get any psychological counseling so a lot of the old-timers are either alcoholics or have some other kind of psychological damage.<p>In the end politics needs to have the courage to address the underfunding and also address the training and management situation. They don&#x27;t want to do either because it may cost money so the bad situation just keeps going. Reminds me of the healthcare situation where even the most blatant problems go unaddressed because it&#x27;s more important to do partisan fighting instead of addressing issues.

If you buy one, keep in mind that a Pilot medium nib is similar to most Fine nibs. If I had to recommend one pen to start out with, it would be that one. And it was my favorite one until recently - I found it better than many of the more expensive ones.<p>You can get some really good looking, cheap, Jinhaos on the Internet (eBay, etc) (e.g. $4&#x2F;pen). These are Chinese pens, and the quality control is fairly poor. You can buy 5 of the same model and one may be great and another may not. The good ones, though, are great. They are not cheap quality material. I got an x450, and swapped out the nib for a Goulet nib, and I love the pen.<p>penBBS[1] is a Chinese woman who makes pens and sells them on Etsy. These are of quite good quality - you can search the Internet for reviews. I have a 309 - it was the first pen among many that I&#x27;ve tried that dethroned the Pilot Metropolitan. She also has some creative designs like the 469 which has a nib and compartment at both ends, so you can fill it with 2 different inks. The nibs on the PenBBS are OK, but some of them will allow you to swap with other brands&#x27; nibs - be sure to research this though as not all her pens will allow for this (the caps may not fit with other nibs of the same size).<p>Most of the joy with fountain pens is using is trying different inks out. Various sites sell samplers. I usually buy mine from Goulet Pens[2]. Unless you really use the pen a lot a bottle of ink (35-50ml) will last years, and it&#x27;s boring to use the same ink over and over. So I just buy the samplers. You may need a syringe to fill your pen with them, though.<p>Last but not least - the type of paper matters, and most notebooks in the US are not fountain pen ink friendly. You&#x27;ll get feathering, bleed through, or both. Try Clairefontaine or Figurare notebooks. There are other options. If you have a Japanese store in your town with a stationery section, chances are most of their notebooks will be good with FP ink as I believe Japanese students still use FP a lot.<p>I don&#x27;t recommend spending more on a pen than you are willing to lose. People lose pens all the time. I&#x27;ve personally lost 2 Pilot Metropolitans. If it&#x27;s valuable, you will keep it at home and rarely use it.<p>(Yes, I walk around with a FP pen in my pocket.

So liberals who supported social programs weren&#x27;t just wishful thinkers or muddy-headed -- they had just as much intellectual rigor as market conservatives. This was <i>huge<\/i>.<p>But the &quot;universal&quot; aspect of his philosophy always seemed rather suspect. Forrester&#x27;s book is a wonderful history of how his ideas evolved as products of the time and specific national&#x2F;international historic circumstances, and were often &quot;out of date&quot; by the time they were published, and therefore there&#x27;s nothing &quot;universal&quot; about them, and that the veneration given to his ideas may be preventing us from developing even better ones.<p>But tying any of this to Trump or Dershowitz is total nonsense&#x2F;clickbait."],"time":["2020-05-31 19:24:27"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["PaulDavisThe1st"],"id":[23370930],"kids":[23371061,23373173],"parent":[23367442],"text":["Maybe it is necessary to read the book that the article is ostensibly built around.

Fair enough, and almost certainly true, but what does this have to say about Rawls ideas themselves?<p>The closest it comes is by mentioning Haraway&#x27;s &quot;god trick&quot; critique, which is not fleshed out nor given any real standing. Haraway&#x27;s critiques and ideas are not stupid, but they stand in absolute opposition to Rawls (and others of his &quot;kind&quot;) in asserting that there really can be no universal knowledge (because it is all situated). This isn&#x27;t really a critique of Rawls, it&#x27;s just a denial that the entire project of western philosophy can ever be well-conceived.

For example, what happened to the blue slip system? What happened with Merrick Garland? The Republican Party didn&#x27;t care that Supreme Court judges were traditionally elected with at least 60% confirmation vote in the Senate, and they certainly didn&#x27;t care that they were denying a Democratic President his right to appoint <i>any<\/i> judge.<p>In reality, the impeachment of Donald Trump happened because there was no downside for the Democrats. They knew that there was no chance of conviction, so there was no risk of the destabilization&#x2F;backlash that might happen if the President was actually removed from office. The upside was not only that Congress could subpoena for information, but also that the party could enjoy the political benefits of the impeachment proceedings. Arguably, it was a time-waster for the Trump administration. It aided the <i>perception<\/i> of those who might lean Democrat or might dislike Donald Trump that the Democratic Party was working to bring about change. In reality, the effort changed precisely nothing and had no far-reaching political consequences besides a few mild upsides for the Democratic Party (at least that I can see).<p>The situation reminds me of instances where vote trading happens, where the political parties strategically trade votes on issues they know either will or won&#x27;t pass. For example, a Democrat or Republican in a weak district might vote against the Party&#x27;s own initiative to give their constituents the perception that they aren&#x27;t really like the other members of their party. For a hypothetical example, you could have a Democratic congressperson in a red state vote against gun control legislation, while the hypothetical bill had no chance of failing due to other congresspeople in blue states voting for it.<p>The idea presented by this article works well for philosophers and intellectuals - but philosophers and intellectuals do not run our government, and politics have nothing to do with such things.

Focus on the cause, and the symptoms disappear.<p>But then it&#x27;s impossible to provide any absolute answer.  There&#x27;s overwhelming beauty in humanity.  The good ones are forgiving, and the bad ones will take advantage, and this takes us into game theory.  The only way the game changes is if the rules are changed to have more &#x2F; worse consequences for the bad actors; better systems to ensure the enforcement of these consequences.<p>Bad elements of humanity will persist despite all this; we&#x27;ll be colonising Mars in parallel with children being brought up to hate anything unfamiliar, female circumcision will still be law in some countries, and there will still governments that censor and censure even minor dissent, flat-earthers, anti-vaxxers, holocaust deniers.<p>I don&#x27;t know if the US is making progress in race relations.

But it&#x27;s ignorable, for me, and therein lies the cause of the lack of political will: the symptoms aren&#x27;t bad enough warrant the cost of seeing the doctor.  School shootings once a month aren&#x27;t bad enough to change gun laws; one dead black man doesn&#x27;t have anywhere near the political capital of a dozen dead children.<p>For there to be change, the symptoms have to be more extreme, and they have to persist.

They are civic servants. Police have an obligation to protect their fellow citizens, even if those citizens are protesting Police.* The amount of examples of police actively instigating violence [1] in the last 48 hours is horrifying, but perhaps not surprising. Police have a 2-4x the incident rate of domestic violence [2] than the rest of the population. And with the President tweeting support for them to respond to protests with violence, it makes sense that they would feel enabled to act accordingly.<p>In every city protest the exact same script has unfolded:<p>* A peaceful protest starts<p>* A heavily militarized police force descends on the protest and begins oppressing it without overtly instigating any engagement<p>* SOMEONE pushes things over the line. That someone might be a protestor, but honestly looking around and reading the news it seems like it is equally likely right now to be Police themselves, or a provocateur masquerading as a protestor.<p>* Police overreact, violence and property destruction abounds<p>* Mayor&#x2F;governor instigate curfew<p>* AHA - now any private citizen on the street is automatically a criminal<p>* Police take the initiative and run with it targeting journalists and instigating violence.<p>So what&#x27;s next? I think this needs to be a reckoning in the US unlike any since 9&#x2F;11. 9&#x2F;11 created The Department Of Homeland Security. And regardless of what you think of the execution of that program, the point was that it was a serious action designed to take the threat of terrorist attacks against the US seriously. I believe the US needs an equally powerful independent government agency to oversee local police departments. There are simply no checks and balances otherwise. No oversight. No one watches The Watchmen. Before you tell me that this is a massive Federal overreach, I believe this could be similar in scope to Desegregation and School Integration, which were federal top-down projects.<p>P.S. If you turn this thread around to talk about the &quot;looters&quot;, so help you god. You are a lost cause. So let&#x27;s just get this out of the way: No, looting is not morally justifiable. But in the grand scheme of things, the moral failings of those protestors that are taking this opportunity to loot is incomparable with the overall message of the protest or the harm inflected upon the African American community by centuries of systemic racism.<p>* * Or at least, they SHOULD.

Here are a few of my thoughts:<p>What about a patronage model? The demand for news is universal and the ability for people to pay the price of news they consume (not at all universal) lends itself better to a patronage model where a smaller number overpay rather than a larger number bearing true external costs. By this I mean is that the article proposes that people pay for 3 or 4 different news sources at a few hundred dollars a year. It&#x27;s true that many on HN meet this threshold, and probably should pay for their news. But based on how few people have an emergency reserve, how many people live hand to mouth, how many people don&#x27;t take vacations, I&#x27;m pretty sure many consumers of news simply don&#x27;t have this kind of disposable income. Urbanites, who are the most likely to demand many forms of news, are also the most severely burdened in terms of other fixed costs (rent, food, insurance, transportation). The author sidesteps the disposable income question by listing other products they perceive to be more successful (like, say, Netflix) without really engaging what that comparison means.<p>By contrast to the individual subscriber, a single billionaire could endow many news organizations in perpetuity without blinking -- and in fact a lot of journalism is subsidized in this manner. The article quotes The Atlantic (being floated by the Jobs estate); the Washington Post (being floated by Bezos); and the LA Times (being floated by a wealthy doctor in Los Angeles). Of course all of these have ad and subscription revenue as well, but it speaks to the idea that there&#x27;s an outsized role for institutional funding.<p>The same is of course true for government. It would be trivial for the government to endow local journalism all over the country, but there is a strong aversion to this because of the perception in America that state funding, state ownership, and state propaganda are all synonyms.<p>Local papers? If Jeff Bezos took 50% of his growth in net worth this year, he could permanently endow every single local newspaper in the entire country in perpetuity. Does it really matter what I do?<p>Hell, let&#x27;s look at smaller patrons. The author is a senior software engineer at Google: one very simple proposal that we know the author can afford is buying, say, 100 subscriptions of a worthy paper and donating them. Is it likely this article is going to drive 100 new subscriptions by readers? I doubt it. So if the author really means to achieve the goal they are advocating, this is a route their article doesn&#x27;t consider. One possible response is &quot;it shouldn&#x27;t be incumbent on me to be a public good provider&quot; or &quot;how dare you assume I have that kind of money&quot; -- both of which would be responses to the article&#x27;s thesis, with the added benefit that the responders wouldn&#x27;t be senior software engineers at Google. In fact, the author surely knows dozens of other SSEs at Google who also feel the same way politically about this issue. Why not solicit them?<p>Lest this seem facetious, when I look at what @pinboard has done with the Great Slate electoral campaign in 2018 and with his fundraising this time around, it&#x27;s clear to me that approach is more effective than simply the righteous blog post. Skin in the game. I would enthusiastically upvote a Google SSE handing out hundreds of subscriptions because supporting journalism is important and $10-20k is trivial for them.<p>But also the decline of journalism is actually nothing to do with individuals not valuing it and everything to do with structural factors individuals can&#x27;t impact.<p>To the extent we&#x27;re talking about local journalism, a large part of the issue was national consolidation of publishing companies. This is a government issue and it requires muscular antitrust action to undo. It&#x27;s also compounded by the national consolidation of advertising, and the national consolidation of other businesses. As long as big ad firms do most of the ad placement in newspapers owned by big newspaper firms, and most of those ads are for big companies, there will always be pressure towards viewing small local papers as unsustainable.<p>Second, a lot of the more recent wave of journalism cuts has been text journalism unsuccessfully chasing YouTube and Facebook money. It&#x27;s well documented [1, using the authors preferred source] that Facebook misled video watch figures and that this led to the loss of tens or hundreds of thousands of jobs. This is not an individual problem, it&#x27;s a regulatory and structural problem. I could have told these places that chasing Facebook clickbait was going to bite them in the ass economically because it&#x27;s a house of cards. They didn&#x27;t listen. Why are Google and Facebook not looked at as the cause of this problem?<p>Also, the ad-first model has also hampered consumer direct-payment expectations. I can subscribe to a lot of paper magazines for $5&#x2F;year. I don&#x27;t want paper magazines, I never read them. So why does it cost 25-50x that to subscribe to the same content online? Answer: because that&#x27;s the true price of what it ought to cost, but I&#x27;ve now been conditioned to free-ride. But I didn&#x27;t ask publication to pivot to be ad-first, a variety of structural incentives did that.<p>Some other hanging user side questions: Why is it not easy to pay for the odd article read rather than a full price subscription? I read news from all around the country. I have no objection to a newspaper in Des Moines getting some of my money, but I won&#x27;t be jumping through hoops to pay them $0.20. Why is search still so bad in online journalism? Why is there still an above-the-fold paper-first design paradigm? Why can&#x27;t I customize sections without using adblock to block the sections I don&#x27;t like? Why is so much of the page designed to get me to leave the page to share stuff on social media? Why are URLs so impermanent? Why is everything a low end liveblog format now? Why do major newspapers pay standing op-ed columnists to engage in empty punditry about things they know nothing instead of spending more soliciting the best possible external op-eds on a given subject? Who on earth thinks Bret Stephens has ever added value to any conversation ever? It might well be the case that making a product that&#x27;s more convenient and less infuriating will solicit more individual compliance, but it&#x27;s not individual feedback that drove these bad decisions to begin with.<p>I know this is a pretty far-reaching comment, but I think if we&#x27;re going to have the conversation, let&#x27;s have it.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theatlantic.com&#x2F;technology&#x2F;archive&#x2F;2018&#x2F;10&#x2F;facebook-driven-video-push-may-have-cost-483-journalists-their-jobs&#x2F;573403&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theatlantic.com&#x2F;technology&#x2F;archive&#x2F;2018&#x2F;10&#x2F;faceb...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-31 23:46:10"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mey"],"id":[23372916],"kids":[23373090,23373213,23372973,23373060,23373033],"parent":[23372570],"text":["I tried, except, everywhere I looked, they promoted Op-ed pieces with equal billing and authority as traditional investigative reporting.

On the one hand I&#x27;m outraged by what the protesters are doing and want to see them brought to justice. The idea of using mobile location data to retroactively find who the looters are and persecute them for their crimes is satisfying to some degree. On the other hand, it&#x27;s a very terrifying pandora&#x27;s box which could allow the surveillance state to reach new levels of intrusion.<p>It&#x27;s even scarier to think that reconnaissance satellites are now actually really good and can probably trace you even in the dead-of-night. So, even if you left your phone at home to avoid location-tracking, just the act of venturing outside your house creates a tracking-trail as exposed by satellite imagery. Theoretically, law enforcement could use this data as of today to persecute the looters. Again, satisfying in a way, but also scary to think about.<p>How libertarian do we really want to be? I think the goal should be to opt for whatever leads to the greatest good for the greatest number of people. There&#x27;s a spectrum, on one hand you have free libertarianism, and on the other, you have authoritarinism and strict social control. It&#x27;s interesting to watch how states on different sides of the spectrum operate; namely, the contrast between liberties for citizens in the US and China. Which one is better?<p>In the US we operate under the premise that we should ensure our liberties are upheld at all costs; yet, this comes at a severe cost. China&#x27;s authoritarian approach allows them to withstand epidemics in ways that we couldn&#x27;t even dream to; and, overall, their centralized approach will allow them to surpass the US in terms of economic output. They also enjoy much lower levels of crime as measured by many different data points. In many ways I think the non-libertarian approach to life there will eventually lead most people to living better lives overall. Not saying that their approach is correct; but it&#x27;s just interesting to think about."],"time":["2020-05-31 22:30:54"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["chosenbreed37"],"id":[23372037],"kids":[23374840],"parent":[23371978],"text":["It didn&#x27;t take long..."],"time":["2020-05-31 21:38:59"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["tonyarkles"],"id":[23369385],"kids":{},"parent":[23362394],"text":["Lately I&#x27;ve been getting back into desktop UI land to put a visual interface onto an image processing pipeline.

I wanna share it with you guys and once again ask for more feedback.<p>The original feature of this project is only shot analysis, it could trace the basketball shot and determine whether it&#x27;s a score or miss. And now, it has a brand new feature! It&#x27;s capable of analyzing the shooting pose. Besides displaying the angle of elbow and knee on every frame, it will also show the average pose analysis of each shot attempt. Release angle and release time are also included!<p>1. I implemented OpenPose to analyze the shooting pose. The angle of elbow and knee is calculated with the data collected by OpenPose.<p>2. The original shot analysis has a big problem which is that it would misdetect a head as a ball, and that will really mess up my algorithm. I solve this problem by avoiding the detections near the head coordinate collected from OpenPose.<p>3. The shot release angle is calculated with the first two detection points of the shot analysis.<p>4. Please note that there will be a relatively big error for the release time since it was calculated as the total time when the ball is in hand for each shot.

And seeing what SpaceX has done to get to this point, it is clear to me that was never even close to possible. The Russian program is great in that way. It shows what that path might have looked like.

Much like with Covid today, scientists are interested in understanding when the disease first appeared. Because that gives us clues about where it came from and how quickly it is changing now. You can estimate this based on changes in the sequence of the genome. Changes (mutations) will appear in the genome at a predictable rate (&quot;mutation rate&quot;), and is measured as mutations per generation.<p>For HIV, there are plenty of estimates for the mutation rate based off a mixture of statistical bioinformatics and knowledge of genetics. But they are all inferences because we don&#x27;t have many sequences from before 1988.

The real gist is that massive deallocations in the UI thread cause lag, which the example code proves.

That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s so pathological.  It&#x27;s not just a &quot;large&quot; vector.  It&#x27;s a vector of 1 million vectors.  While that may seem contrived, consider a vector of 1 million strings, something that&#x27;s not too uncommon, and which would likely suffer the same performance penalty.<p>* Rust is not copying anything, nor duplicating the structures here.  In the example code the structures would be moved, not copied, which costs nothing.  The deallocation is taking up 99% of the time.<p>* As an aside, compilers have used the trick of not free-ing data structures before, because it provides a significant performance boost.  Instead of calling free on all those billions of tiny data structures a compiler would generate during its lifetime, they just let them leak.  Since a compiler is short lived its not a problem, they get a free lunch (pun unintended), and the OS takes care of cleaning up after all is said and done.

Rust encourages an eager deallocation strategy (kind of like C), whereas many other languages would use a more deferred strategy (like many GCs).<p>It seems like deferred (e.g. GC) would be better here, because after the main object is dropped, the GC doesn&#x27;t bother to traverse all of the tiny allocations because they are all dead (unreachable by the root), and it just discards them. But that&#x27;s not the full story either.<p>It&#x27;s not terribly common to build up zillions of allocations and then immediately free them. What&#x27;s more common is to keep the structure (and its zillions of allocations) around for a while, perhaps making small random modifications, and then eventually freeing them all at once. If using a GC, while the large structure is alive, the GC needs to scan all of those objects, causing a pause each time, which is not great. The eager strategy is also not great: it only needs to traverse the structure once (at deallocation time), but it needs to individually deallocate.<p>The answer here is to recognize that all of the objects in the structure will be deallocated together. Use a separate region&#x2F;arena&#x2F;heap for the entire structure, and wipe out that region&#x2F;arena&#x2F;heap when the structure gets dropped. You don&#x27;t need to traverse anything while the structure is alive, or when it gets dropped.<p>In rust, probably the most common way to approximate this is by using slices into a larger buffer rather than separate allocations. I wish there was a little better way of doing this, though. It would be awesome if you could make new heaps specific to an object (like a hash table), then allocate the keys&#x2F;values on that heap.

When passing an object (rather than a reference to an object) there&#x27;s a lot more work going on both in function setup, and in object dropping.  I&#x27;m not a rust guru, so I don&#x27;t know the precise wording, but it&#x27;s simple enough to realize that if this function, as claimed, must drop all the sub-objects within the `HeavyObject` type, then those objects must have been copied from the original object.<p>If you instead define the function to take in a reference (by adding just two `&amp;` characters into your program), the single-threaded case is now almost 100x faster than the multithreaded case.<p>Here&#x27;s a link to a Rust Playground with just those two characters changed: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.rust-lang.org&#x2F;?version=stable&amp;mode=debug&amp;edition=2018&amp;gist=9bbe169c77cd31b6cd25b74c24635e12\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.rust-lang.org&#x2F;?version=stable&amp;mode=debug&amp;editio...<\/a><p>Note that the code that drops the data in a separate thread is not timing the amount of time your CPU is spinning, dropping the data.  So while this does decrease the latency of the original thread, the best solution is to avoid copying and then freeing large, complex objects as much as possible.  While it is of course necessary to do this sometimes, this particular example is just not one of them.  :)<p>As an aside, I&#x27;m somewhat surprised that the Rust compiler isn&#x27;t inlining and eliminating all the copying and dropping; this would seem to be a classic case where compiler analysis should be able to determine that `a.size()` should be computable without copying `a`, and it should be able to eliminate the function call cost as well.  Manually doing this gives the exact same timing as my gist above, so I assume that this is happening when passing a reference, but not happening when passing the object itself."],"time":["2020-05-30 19:31:23"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["clueless123"],"id":[23366303],"kids":[23367936,23366486,23366623,23368355,23367146,23367419,23366980],"parent":[23358357],"text":["Fantastic Skydiving vehicle..

The fact that Linux doesn&#x27;t have a binary-compatible driver interface is a good thing: It means hardware vendors have a very strong incentive to get their drivers upstream into the kernel.

Snark aside, this is a serious debate since the inception of Linux [1].<p>It&#x27;s important to look at Fuchsia through the lens of what problems it solves in Android&#x2F;Linux because that tells you a lot.<p>As we know, receiving updates in Android is, well, a clusterfark. There are two key problems:<p>1. Phone manufacturers need to write or update drivers essentially with each Android release; and<p>2. Those drivers are by nature of Linux being a monolithic kernel, written in kernel space. Kernel space code by third-parties is going to be inherently more unstable to your device than if they were written in user space.<p>So when Google talks about Fuchsia having a stable binary ABI for drivers, they&#x27;re talking about solving both of these problems (at least as they see them).<p>So the question I&#x27;ve always had about the justifications for pouring billions of dollars into Fuchsia (I mean that quite literally) is: could this really not have been solved in Linux, even if it&#x27;s just the limited context of Android?<p>I&#x27;m not a driver or Linux expert by any stretch of the imagination. I&#x27;m sure there are people here who are so this is my question to you: could you have created a system for ideally user space drivers with a stable ABI in Linux and avoided all the costs of completely reinventing that wheel?<p>My other question about Fuchsia is: does Google foresee themselves adopting the same vertically integrated solution that, say, Apple does? It&#x27;s worth noting that Apple by not providing iOS to third parties is somewhat paradoxically immune to antitrust investigations (I mean really... how does that work?).<p>Evidence against Google adopting the Apple model is the fact that Fuchsia is open source, which is a curious decision. This seems to imply that Google either wants to maintain an Android-like ecosystem or they simply see it as their only viable option.<p>I don&#x27;t know how anyone can expect that Samsung is going to move to Fuchsia. Samsung already chafes under the yoke of their Google dependence with Android. They&#x27;ve tried to get out from under it (ie Tizen) but luckily for Google, Samsung is terrible at software (at anyone with Samsung crapware on their Galaxy can attest; Bixby anyone?).<p>Maybe Google thinks the insurance of Fuchsia being open source is necessary for third-party adoption to have any chance but still, the only way I see Samsung going along with this is that there&#x27;s absolutely no other alternative.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Tanenbaum%E2%80%93Torvalds_debate\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Tanenbaum%E2%80%93Torvalds_deb...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-31 02:34:31"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jokoon"],"id":[23368732],"kids":[23378358],"parent":[23364172],"text":["It&#x27;s been 4 years and it&#x27;s still being developed?

However, servers have to deal with broken clients, so it’s easy to point at the server and say it was broken, or to point at the server and say it’s fixed, but that’s not quite the case.<p>I discussed this some in <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;sleevi_&#x2F;status&#x2F;1266647545675210753\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;sleevi_&#x2F;status&#x2F;1266647545675210753<\/a> , as clients need to be prepared to discover and explore alternative certificate paths. Almost every major CA relies on cross-certificates, some even with circular loops (e.g. DigiCert), and clients need to be capable of exploring those certificates and finding what they like. There’s not a single canonical “correct” certificate chain, because of course different clients trust different CAs.<p>Regardless of your CA, you can still do things to reduce the risk. Using tools like mkbundle in CFSSL (with <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;cloudflare&#x2F;cfssl_trust\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;cloudflare&#x2F;cfssl_trust<\/a> ) or <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;whatsmychaincert.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;whatsmychaincert.com&#x2F;<\/a> help configure a chain that will maximize interoperability, even with dumb and old clients.<p>Of course, using shorter lived certificates, and automating them, also helps prepare your servers, by removing the toil from configuring changes and making sure you pickup updates (to the certificate path) in a timely fashion.<p>Tools like Censys can be used to explore the certificate graph and visualize the nodes and edges. You’ll see plenty of sites rely on this, and that means clients need to not be lazy in how they verify certificates. Or, alternatively, that root stores should impose more rules on how CAs sign such cross-certificates, to reduce the risk posed to the ecosystem by these events."],"time":["2020-05-30 22:42:37"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["elithrar"],"id":[23362931],"kids":{},"parent":[23362759],"text":["Great thread by Ryan Sleevi tracking the many (and growing) reports of issues caused by this root expiring: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;sleevi_&#x2F;status&#x2F;1266647545675210753\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;sleevi_&#x2F;status&#x2F;1266647545675210753<\/a><p>Top offender so far seems to be GnuTLS."],"time":["2020-05-30 19:33:50"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Mojah"],"id":[23362956],"kids":[23363116,23366196,23363026],"parent":[23362759],"text":["This issue is largely cause by people still stuffing old root certificates in their certificate chains, and serving that to their users.<p>As a general rule of thumb:<p>1) You don&#x27;t need to add root certificates to your certificate chain<p>2) You especially don&#x27;t need to add expired root certificates to the chain<p>For additional context and the ability to check using `openssl` what certificates you should modify in your chain, I found this post useful: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ohdear.app&#x2F;blog&#x2F;resolving-the-addtrust-external-ca-root-certificate-expiration\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ohdear.app&#x2F;blog&#x2F;resolving-the-addtrust-external-ca-r...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-30 19:36:28"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["MobileVet"],"id":[23363362],"kids":{},"parent":[23362759],"text":["This appears to have caused our Heroku managed apps to go offline for 70+ minutes.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;status.heroku.com&#x2F;incidents&#x2F;2034\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;status.heroku.com&#x2F;incidents&#x2F;2034<\/a><p>Anyone that was already connected was able to continue accessing the sites but new connections failed.

Adding new root certificates at least for PCs is rather easy due to their extreme portability, but I wish the same could be said of crypto algorithms&#x2F;libraries."],"time":["2020-05-31 02:07:15"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["niffydroid"],"id":[23364047],"kids":[23374246],"parent":[23362759],"text":["Thankfully our uptime services spotted this earlier in the week.

I perform and record classical and “jazz” and compose music. I learned to code a while ago too. \nHere are a few vocalists who “taught themselves” how to sing: Chet Baker, Stevie Wonder, Ella Fitzgerald, Sheila Jordan, Blossom Dearie, Bob Dorough, James Taylor, Nelly McKay... even Barbara Streisand. (at first) I’d say all great singers play an instrument well, but Ella and Sheila didn’t, nor did Barbara. What do you like to sing? What do you want to do with it? Since you didn’t say “opera” and you called it “vocals”, I’m guessing you like pop or jazz or singer&#x2F;songwriter stuff. If jazz, who is your hero? If they are alive, call them up for a lesson. I promise they will love to teach anyone with enthusiasm. I know, because I know this crowd of vocalists well. Where do you live? Looking past these times, it would be great for you to just go out and sing with a band every week. Every city has such a thing and it is usually a supportive group of people. Singers are great for that. But most impirtantly— apart from opera— there is no wrong way. we have mics now. Don’t worry about doing something “with bad habits”. The only important bad habit to avoid is to not try for fear of doing something wrong. I promise that there is no wrong if you listen, embrace mistake making and experiment with relish. That is how any great singer or musician  does it. You don’t “need a teacher” but it’s fun to have someone to check in with. Better than a teacher— pick some songs you love, learn them and find a fantastic, professional accompanist who will play them with you once a week. (guitarist, bassist, or pianist— even vibes— a comping instrument, not a melody one)I could recommend actual people if I knew where you were.  Just listen hundreds of times to great vocalists singing the same song. For example: How Deep Is The Ocean— Sheila Jordan, Chet Baker, Ella, ... anyone you love and imitate exactly how they sing it— note for note, bend for bend, even the scatting parts- especially those. Get the phone app: The Amazing Slow Downer and loop sections so you can sing exactly like them. This builds your ear and your technique. Obviously, you don’t want to sing the song like they do at all, but you want to learn from them. For more current singers—I’ve been digging Natalia Lafourcade recently, her phrasing is impeccable and natural. Nelly McKay is also such a natural singer- her If I had You is so perfect. Just put a little set together w a friend and go outside (10 ft apart) and sing to people walking by. That’s better than any teacher. I wish you great fun and encourage you to get singing ASAP!

You don&#x27;t have experience related to singing, so you are not even able to diagnose what you are doing wrong and start working on it. You accidentally start pushing yourself into direction opposite to what you should be doing as I did at some point. Also, it&#x27;s important to find a <i>good<\/i> one: if a teacher suggests something, then you try it for a few weeks and nothing changes, then maybe it&#x27;s time to find another one. I&#x27;m not saying you can learn everything in a month, but you should at least notice something is changing and and understand what exactly you are working on. If the teacher can&#x27;t explain what exactly you should improve (and how) other than &quot;sound better&quot; then likely it&#x27;s not a good teacher. I cannot stress how important is finding the right teacher. Two lessons with right guy I found were much more effective than everything else I did beforehand for years (youtube tutorials, lessons with other people, trial and error). Don&#x27;t try to be cheap: few weeks with someone who knows what they are doing can take you further than months with someone who doesn&#x27;t (obviously I&#x27;m not saying that all good teachers are expensive and all cheap are bad. What I&#x27;m saying is that there is SO MUCH DIFFERENCE between an average and a great teacher that it&#x27;s often worth paying for example twice as much). One more thing about teachers is try to get demos of their students and see if you like how they sing.<p>Another piece of advice: get used to recording and listening to yourself. It&#x27;s frustrating, but it&#x27;s second best thing I did after finding a good teacher. I can&#x27;t imagine making progress on singing without recording. And you can record yourself on a smartphone&#x2F;laptop&#x2F;whatever for practice purposes, no need to buy any audio equipment."],"time":["2020-05-30 21:43:29"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["amelius"],"id":[23365889],"kids":{},"parent":[23359096],"text":["Join a choir!

It means practice, having a teacher, unlearning potentially years of bad habits, and being disciplined. I like to write and record songs with a friend as a fun hobby, and since he hates the sound of his own voice, I got stuck with singing duties. I&#x27;ve learned to accept the rather frustrating limitations of my voice and technique, and instead focused on using my engineering skills to improve how my vocal tracks sound on recordings. I was able to learn this stuff on my own.<p>* Tuning<p>Good tuning software is a vocalists best friend, even if you don&#x27;t struggle with pitch issues. Don&#x27;t like the timbre of your voice? Good tuning software has the ability to manipulate the &quot;formant&quot; of a voice, which if used in conjunction with some pitch shifting can make a woman&#x27;s voice sound like a man&#x27;s, or vice versa. Tuning software is also invaluable for visualizing the notes that you&#x27;re singing. I use tuning software to help me compose and finalize my vocal melodies. I start with my scratch vocal take and push notes around until I have a consistent result I&#x27;m happy with, melodically speaking. These tuned scratch takes become &quot;guide tracks&quot; that I can have in my headphones while recording new takes. You can also turn them into MIDI tracks to aid in composing other parts.<p>* Comping<p>Comping is where you create a good composite track out of a bunch of mediocre ones. I do like 8 takes of each part, and then I pitch correct all of them so they conform to my official melody, referencing my guide track as needed. I also clean up the timing of sung notes at this stage (another great use of tuning software) to make sure that I&#x27;m not too far off the beat. Small slop is OK.<p>I have 8 tracks now of tuned vocals that are mostly bound to the grid, which makes it easier to select the best bits from each track to create a composite. I try to focus on the notes&#x2F;lines that convey the most emotion and feeling, I comp those 8 tracks down to 3 or 4 decent ones. The best one I save for my lead vocal, the rest I use for doubles and harmony parts.<p>* Double up<p>Choruses need big vocals right? You can use your extra tuned and tightened tracks to double (or triple, quadruple) up your vocals and pan them left&#x2F;right to make them sound bigger and better. Because they&#x27;re unique tracks and not copies this will sound wide, and because you left in some minor timing slop, it will sound tight, but not robotic. You can also use doubles in non-chorus parts to emphasize certain words or phrases.<p>* Harmony<p>Harmony tracks can really sweeten and thicken a vocal. It&#x27;ll definitely help to learn some music theory to understand the right notes for your harmony parts, but you can also just do it by ear. I take a one of my comps, and push the notes around with tuning software so it becomes a harmony against the lead vocal. Sometimes these extreme tuned artificial harmonies can sound robotic, but if you blend them in subtly and&#x2F;or play with the formants they can work well. If not, you can use them as a guide track to re-record organic parts, but that&#x27;s more work. Use harmony parts the same way you might use doubles."],"time":["2020-05-31 04:00:48"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["MrGando"],"id":[23363944],"kids":[23365583,23364018,23364365,23365849],"parent":[23359096],"text":["I&#x27;ve been playing Piano for ~28 years, almost went professional (Jazz) but ended up doing engineering.

Now everyone knows, so it’s the furthest thing from a fundamental advance.&quot;<p>2) &quot;The “zero-shot” learning they demonstrated in the paper – stuff like “adding tl;dr after a text and treating GPT-2's continuation thereafter as a ‘summary’” – were weird and goofy and not the way anyone would want to do these things in practice... They do better with one task example than zero (the GPT-2 paper used zero), but otherwise it’s a pretty flat line; evidently there is not too much progressive “learning as you go” here.&quot;<p>3) &quot;Coercing it to do well on standard benchmarks was valuable (to me) only as a flamboyant, semi-comedic way of pointing this out, kind of like showing off one’s artistic talent by painting (but not painting especially well) with just one’s non-dominant hand.&quot;<p>4) &quot;On Abstract reasoning..So, if we’re mostly seeing #1 here, this is not a good demo of few-shot learning the way the authors think it is.&quot;<p>--------- \nMy response:<p>1) The fact that we can get so much improvement out of something so &quot;mundane&quot; should be cause for celebration, rather than disappointment.

I&#x27;ve got everything I need to write a web app that connects to a Postgres database. I can launch up Visual Studio for free and have almost unparalleled intellisense, etc. Or on a non Windows system Visual Studio for Mac or Visual Studio code. The project template gives me everything set-up and it &#x27;just works&#x27;. If I&#x27;m not sure how to use a library I don&#x27;t have to leave the IDE to browse through variable quality documentation, I can autocomplete to victory or use the REPL or just debug and write the code in the debugger with edit-and-continue.<p>Once it&#x27;s time to move to production `dotnet publish -r linux-x64 -c release` and I have my production ready deployable application.<p>Now when I go back to Python or these other languages at least one or more parts of that process is missing. I know I&#x27;m biased but it feels like for other ecosystems the &#x27;pain is the point&#x27;. It should be as simple as that and it needs tooling, especially an IDE to match.<p>Almost certainly people feel this way about other languages they use, but I think there&#x27;s an enraging habit for software development as a field to throw away the old tool we were used to and that was comfortable and worked, for some new thing that doesn&#x27;t get the job done and is a godawful pain to work with (goodbye XML hello YAML). This really contributes to my burnout and disillusion with the field in general, though I&#x27;m on the road to recovery.<p>Edit: This rant clarified what I&#x27;m actually frustrated with. There&#x27;s no way .NET would have reached the (excellent) point it is now without competition from other ecosystems, the whole dotnet CLI owes a lot to other ecosystems and evolution does improve things.<p>But I&#x27;m just sick, in this field, of feeling like a failure, or a fossil because people are constantly hyped about some hot newness and if it gets introduced, I&#x27;m going to have to learn it because that&#x27;s the job. I&#x27;m not excited to learn flavour of the month cloud tool, or database replacement, or configuration language (I hate YAML so much) or language or framework. Other people are, and that&#x27;s fine and good, but if those people introduce the thing at work then I now have to learn it and 9 times out of 10 we&#x27;ll be having discussions 5 years down the road about why micro-services, or NoSQL or whatever it might be, was overhyped and we&#x27;ve found the right approach (which was almost identical to the approach before we started this). People should be free to have fun with those new tools, but I feel there&#x27;s explicit or implicit judgement of people who just want to use the tools they know, that have known best practices and failure modes and whatever else.
