It’s simply intractable for a human to spread their attention like that and remain diligent and focused on communication metadata about every pairwise colleague interaction channel. It spreads you too thin and you run into extremely exhausting ego depletion and decision fatigue from all these little micro communication assessments you have to make that our brains are just not setup or wired to handle because we’re so adapted to analog facial and voice analysis with gestures and cues.<p>I despise loud, distracting open floor plans deeply, but the pandemic time period has made me deeply question whether fully remote work would actually be better. I feel way more tired and mentally exhausted from remote work, and casually I’ve noticed many, many more arguments and short fuse communication issues with everyone in my company.<p>I think it speaks to the evidence that the most cost effective office environments for knowledge workers, even in dense urban centers, from the point of view of pure short term cost savings to the company, are environments where every individual knowledge worker has a private office with a door that shuts, combined with separate communal workspaces for the extreme minority of people who either need a mix or need more extraverted &#x2F; social work environments instead of quiet &#x2F; private workspaces.<p>That way meetings naturally happen in person and it’s low-cost to setup meetings, grab coffee together, grab lunch, etc., while still preserving the remote work benefits of privacy and quiet.<p>Unfortunately though my experience working remotely has taught me that avoiding a commute is deeply not a good reason to be remote, because the costs in terms of worse work experiences and worse communication are way too high."],"time":["2020-09-07 20:54:44"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["theodric"],"id":[24402365],"kids":{},"parent":[24401246],"text":["Looks like I&#x27;ll never work at Netflix!"],"time":["2020-09-07 22:12:12"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["Rafuino"],"id":[24403394],"kids":{},"parent":[24401246],"text":["&quot;Politics is tough because in many ways people elect people who lie a lot.

I am also someone who has been on the receiving end of bullying and (rarely) on the dispensing end, but I feel that the premise of this article is wrong. The reason why people did not care about the highway of death is because 1) it happened a long way away 2) people like us, from our side, did it 3) very few popular faces said it was wrong and 4) it happened to people we don&#x27;t care about very much.

Living High and Letting Die, Peter Unger) which I don&#x27;t feel can be construed as bullying. A similar example is the behavior of the allies immediately after the second world war, who apparently did little to acknowledge the Holocaust.<p>My view differs from David&#x27;s in that I don&#x27;t think we seek to justify bullies because we think they are better than their victims - I think we seek to justify bullies because we don&#x27;t care very much about other people, due to lack of time and energy.

I couldn&#x27;t get emacs to play nice with syntax highlighting modern front end. I could get JSX highlighted OR I could get TypeScript highlighted. Not both. I started using WebStorm and discovered that the emacs keybindings were pretty good! Not perfect but the best I&#x27;ve found outside of emacs. And the refactoring! So nice, so convenient.<p>I still used emacs for various languages. Ruby, Python, then some Rust. I wrote a solid amount of Rust in emacs. But then my Rust projects started growing, I started wanting automatic refactors and good type info. A couple times setting up language servers on emacs had chastened me. So I switched to IntelliJ Rust. And damn, it&#x27;s really nice. Same decent emacs keybindings, with really good language tooling. I can see the inferred type of a variable while I&#x27;m typing it out. I can refactor without having to run cargo all the time.<p>At this point I use emacs for writing blog posts, Python&#x2F;Ruby, and config files. That&#x27;s it. Oh and debugging wasm binaries. Hexl-mode is still unrivaled. It&#x27;s a little sad though. I learned to program as I learned emacs. I like the idea of having a powerful, text crunching editor. But it&#x27;s so damn inconvenient.

Multiple cursors mostly work but aren&#x27;t the first class citizens of IntelliJ.<p>If I had to provide a thesis on why emacs is failing me, it&#x27;s because emacs was designed to manipulate text.

Other editors feature <i>similar<\/i> stuff, but not quite as good as this <i>echo mode<\/i> for keybinding.<p>Btw, for Doom Emacs this is accessible through the help interface.<p>`SPC h k &lt;key combo&gt;` will open up the manual page for that function, with a description, list of keybindings, argument list, and at the bottom, full code listing where you can jump to references including callers&#x2F;callees and examine the code in-situ if you need.<p>`SPC h b b` will allow you interactive search through Doom Emacs bindings and bring up the same as above, and `SPC h b` exposes other neat things like keymaps for the current major-mode, etc.<p>---<p>Honestly, I have been using Vim constantly in various forms -- GVim, Vim, Vi, ex-vi, Neovim, etc. (Even ex and ed(1) for a little period) for about 8 years. I discovered Doom Emacs this July, and gave it a few hours. Then I kept on giving it a few hours. A week later I hadn&#x27;t boot up vim for a week. With Vim, there was always a barrier around writing extensions -- it never really felt like it was <i>meant<\/i> to be integrated with them. The single best Vi experience I&#x27;ve had wasn&#x27;t with Neovim, it was with ex-vi. There were some sharp edges but the interface felt orders of magnitude more clean than I was used to.<p>I had tried Emacs before but Spacemacs was poorly integrated -- I tried using package-install and I was dumped into a buffer with no evil-mode bindings. And learning Emacs was a hilarious nightmare. Just look at these amazingly terrible commands to know how horrible that was[0], the last straw was when I tried to undo using `C-x u` (I think?) and it undid one character at a time!<p>Two things sold me on Doom Emacs - the support, and the feeling I get when using it.<p>* The support is amazing, I can&#x27;t even begin to comprehend how much the maintainer, Henrik, works at it. He has a well-developed system on the discord where you can hit up one of the assigned channels (how-do-i or troubleshooting are the main ones as a newbie), tag \\@helpme, and you will get seen quickly. He stays up until 2 am some nights answering support requests, and has put a lot of work into `doom doctor` so there are some rudimentary diagnosics included. It is by far the most pleasant and memorable support experience I&#x27;ve ever had with any piece of software in the 10 years I&#x27;ve been programming, and I have a <i>huge<\/i> amount of respect for him.<p>- The feeling I get when using it is harder to quantify. I&#x27;ll attempt to quantify the 4 or so years I spent digging into hacker history in the following comparison:  \n  - Vim - Editing becomes <i>muscle memory<\/i>, so you don&#x27;t need to think. You can sit down at a computer and be sure it has some variant of Vim that you can use almost like normal.  \n  - Emacs - The editor grows around you, as you customize it to your taste. You&#x27;re taking an editor built on a language, and altering the code, patching in improvements.

A few months down the road they said I wasn&#x27;t meeting expectations because of my &quot;time management&quot; which had too many meetings and lacked focus time for IC work - which definitely was not my 50%+ focus. I&#x27;m &quot;winning&quot; the resulting political war (my last 1:1 left my lead in tears), but only in the limited sense that I&#x27;m not getting fired; it&#x27;s been a bit of a disaster for everyone.<p>The unclear expectations of what gets someone an EM role and what is expected of that role is the root of my problem, some of the author&#x27;s, and a lot of the industry&#x27;s as a whole.<p>Leaders are picked from those that are truly focused on tech and truly excel at it... and then told not to do that. How can somebody be &quot;intuitively, emotionally invested in the outcome&quot; of tech work and then suddenly be expected to stop doing it?<p>I should have been that rare counter-example in that I got picked for this role because of my very visible leadership in other areas. However, when it came time to give me the position formally they fell back on code output and found it somewhat lacking (specifically, the number of commits I made while onboarding was less than those of my established teammates).<p>There&#x27;s a school of thought that switching back and forth between IC and EM tracks lets you build a lot of knowledge and be both better manager and IC (the author evidently did). While I do think experience with each helps you do the other, there is a cost to that focus shifting. This isn&#x27;t like the cost of only being able to code in 45 minute blocks.  It&#x27;s the cost of shifting the things you care most about entirely.<p>Most managers fail to ever make that shift. Even if they manage to hold themselves back from coding (not all do), their heads remain in the code. One sign is when, in response to impossible expectations from above, they try to come up with technical solutions (e.g., if only we redesigned this module we could meet these impossible deadlines). If your mind is focused on tech, it&#x27;s the tool you use to solve every problem. Another example is when team members have no idea how to move their careers forward and don&#x27;t know expectations. A tech focused lead won&#x27;t be thinking about how a new project is actually the perfect challenge for a more junior employee; their head will be figuring out the best way to solve the task technically.<p>An EM is not a tech lead.

And she comes, takes less then a second look at them and starts: &quot;this is light blue, this is magenta, this is black, this is cream white and this is dark green&quot;. Me on the other hand I was seeing some weird green, a dark blue, maroon, yellow and light blue. And we start to bicker about colors. I swear to God, for an hour we went back and forth, involved the kids as well. Well my daughter sided with my wife while my boy sided with me.

If resolv.conf is manually controlled, there is no DHCP to update it, and then you have to declare your DNS servers. But the DNS that you can query from home may not be reachable from a public wifi. And at work, you won&#x27;t have access to the intranet unless you add some private DNS servers at the top of your resolv.conf.

Some of them just try to update it when they receive DHCP data about DNS. Other, like resolvconf, try to separate the manual part from the dhcp-generated part (which is what &quot;manual control&quot; should aim to).

I&#x27;ve tried many different things to motivate myself to either abstain from behavior like smoking or to keep up healthy streaks.<p>An example would be a promise I made last Christmas to my fiancée. I&#x27;ve had a hard time quitting smoking because it&#x27;s my go-to solution when life is stressful and feels like the walls are coming down. I gave her 500€ and told her that money is for a small holiday for us next summer if I don&#x27;t smoke. If I smoke she can keep it all and use it for whatever she wants.<p>Now when I wanted to smoke, I&#x27;d have to weigh the decision against that promise. The downside was, I had a clear price that I could decide to pay if I wanted a cigarette. Needless to say, I failed in two months and now she has a new sewing machine.<p>On the other hand, I&#x27;ve now managed to keep a 45 day streak on duolingo. It&#x27;s a way smaller thing and there&#x27;s nothing externally motivating me except that damn little owl and a little lit flame icon displaying my streak. There&#x27;s no penalty for failing nor is there any way to wiggle out of failing if I choose not to do my daily exercises. My main motivation is just to learn Welsh for the sake of it and I find it much easier to keep this up than any other habit which comes with internal or external pressure.<p>Making your friends hold you accountable to something just sounds like the recipe for getting unmotivated and losing the actual goal and swapping the enjoyment of doing something into fear of some sort of penalty which one could decide was worth facing.<p>I&#x27;ve also heard that talking too much of your ideas and goals will decrease motivation as you gain some feeling of success which should be rewarded to you after you&#x27;ve actually done the deed.

This article is spot on, and I have come to think of people who have developed this mindset as having a kind of selective lack of curiosity, say, defensive disinterest -- they see a system that they don&#x27;t understand, identify that it appears to be dangerous, leave it bloody well alone, and possibly leave a note telling others to do so as well. Those in the know hopefully appreciate when the defensively disinterested warn others off, and as in this thread, take the opportunity to educate about the potentially not completely insane use cases for such things."],"time":["2020-09-06 08:52:25"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["alibarber"],"id":[24389724],"kids":[24389750],"parent":[24388178],"text":["So I came across something like this once, UK 13A Plug -&gt; 16A Ceeform Socket in an event and asked the guy (a professional with credentials) about it and he explained that it was actually fine from a safety standpoint: (This happened a while ago, might have understood it slightly wrong)<p>The 13A fuse was there to protect the thing from drawing more than 13A from the supply. After that it just doesn&#x27;t matter - under a fault, nothing would be able to draw more than the lowest rated link.

Higher-order interactive theorem provers enable the formalization of arbitrary mathematical theories and thereby present an interesting, open-ended challenge for deep learning. We provide an open-source framework based on the HOL Light theorem prover that can be used as a reinforcement learning environment. HOL Light comes with a broad coverage of basic mathematical theorems on calculus and the formal proof of the Kepler conjecture, from which we derive a challenging benchmark for automated reasoning. We also present a deep reinforcement learning driven automated theorem prover, DeepHOL, with strong initial results on this benchmark.<\/i>"],"time":["2020-09-06 18:31:06"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["thomasahle"],"id":[24390125],"kids":[24390786,24390656,24390349],"parent":[24389058],"text":["I wonder why they don&#x27;t mention any work based on transformer architectures?

It&#x27;s designed with concurrency in mind from very beginning and goroutines have advantages of both cooperative and preemptive multitasking. And also it doesn&#x27;t have GIL, so your goroutines will use all available CPUs without any additional effort from your side.<p>From programmers point of view, coding with goroutines looks exactly like coding with use of pthreads (even simpler, in fact). So, there are no function &quot;coloring&quot;, no need in sync&#x2F;async library flavors and so on. But these &quot;threads&quot; also have cost close to cost of python coroutines. It sounds too good to be true, but I&#x27;ve rewritten bunch of my Python&#x2F;asyncio code in Go and I can say it&#x27;s true.
