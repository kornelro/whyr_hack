Finding that property plagued with all manner of insect pests, they were convinced that a pair of peacocks would be the perfect solution; they would eat the insects and look good doing it. Turns out peacocks go where they want to go, unless they can’t. And it became my job on several occasions to track them down, capture them, and bring them back.\nThe task was easier than you’d think (but just as annoying as you would think). Peacocks can fly only short distances. Peacocks are lazy. Peacocks are not intelligent (they do not seem to learn). Whenever our peacocks escaped, it was by flying over our fence. They could be found a short flight from our property (less than 100 yards), usually in a tree. A net big enough to cover a basketball was used, approaching from the front (more of a lateral screen than dropping over the perched bird) invoked their flight response, jumping into the net rather than moving backwards.\nThe officer could have easily walked around, lazily coraling the animal into a fenced area, pictures seem like they were common to the area. He then called animal control (who probably brought a net). And the bird was content to just stand there until animal control arrived (peacocks are lazy, remember? If you’re not pursuing them they’re usually stationary).<p>Makes for a much less interesting story, I know. But if you’re ever in the position of needing to catch a peacock, don’t bother with the app—that part is pure poppycock."],"time":["2020-05-20 06:39:49"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["roel_v"],"id":[23243600],"kids":[23244779,23245497,23243729],"parent":[23242901],"text":["On stories about catching large birds: when I was a teenager I had a job at a DIY store, the owner of which also had a pet store, which in turn was known in the area for selling all sorts of exotic animals (this was 20 years when this was still allowed in Belgium).<p>So he had an outdoor area next to the DIY store where he sold garden statues and stuff, and behind that there was a small paddock he used as &#x27;overflow storage&#x27; for animals he didn&#x27;t have room for elsewhere. Usually there were some ostriches in there, which were quite an attraction and drove part of the business.<p>Anyway one day he sold an ostrich and they asked (well, told me I guess... although to 15 year old me it was much better than stocking shelves) me to catch it. They weren&#x27;t large ostriches (I&#x27;ve seen much larger ones in Australia) but it was still taller than I was at the time (1m80 maybe? maybe there were really emus and not ostriches? I&#x27;m just going off what I was told here).<p>So I put on some overalls and the plan was that my colleague would chase it into a corner, I&#x27;d jump on it to hold it down, then he&#x27;d grab its legs, tie them together, and we&#x27;d carry it into a horse trailer they had standing ready. The &#x27;chasing into a corner&#x27; part went fine, but then when I got on top of it, it started kicking its legs (obviously) and ripped straight through the legs of my overalls - literally kicking it straight through (mostly without hitting my leg though, fortunately, because those feet are more like talons). So now I was stuck to this ostrich with my overall pants, and to make it worse, it turned out this thing was much stronger than we thought, and it literally took me for a ride. I couldn&#x27;t jump off because I was stuck to it, and I needed my two hands to hold its neck to keep it from biting at me. So there I was, riding around a wild ostrich with all the customers as audience, my other colleagues laughing their asses off. So I basically had to squeeze my legs to hold on, trying to control its wings, and sort of wrestle it to the ground after which my colleague had the unenviable task to get hold of its feet.<p>In reality it can&#x27;t have taken us more than a few minutes, but it felt like half an hour, and I came out quite scratched (but with an applause from our &#x27;audience&#x27; so the scratches didn&#x27;t matter).<p>Moral of the story, I guess, is that birds can be much stronger than you think, and overall I&#x27;d recommend against tackling ostriches&#x2F;emus head on.

That is incorrect. Because we believe in user choice and user control, we have no plans to force users to change their DNS provider. Today, there are many independent DNS providers, although ISPs serve approximately 97% of user DNS needs. As long as these service providers keep catering to user needs and concerns, it will remain a diverse ecosystem. We’re simply enabling support in Chrome for secure DoH connections if a user’s DNS provider of choice offers it. Chrome will check if the user’s DNS provider is among a list of participating DoH-compatible providers and if so, it will enable DoH. If the DNS provider is not on the list, Chrome won’t enable DoH and will continue to operate as it does today. As DoH adoption increases, we expect to see the number of DoH-enabled DNS providers grow.<p>This is re-iterated in the next paragraph<p>&gt; The second claim we’ve seen is that the secure DoH connection will limit the family-safe content controls offered by some ISPs.

Liskov says that subclasses must be fully substitutable, and that implies that any valid operation on the superclass must be valid on the subclass.  So say you have a Bag class.  You can add elements to it at will.  Then you create a Set subclass, and now inserting a duplicate throws an exception.  You just broke substitutability.  Even though the code is easy express with this hierarchy (if exists(element) throw else super(element)), your program blows up if you try to substitute.  Doing the opposite is safe, of course, but the code reuse doesn&#x27;t work when you make your Bag a subtype of Set.  From an algorithm standpoint, a Bag isn&#x27;t really implemented in terms of a Set, so you&#x27;re writing a new data structure from scratch (rather than just changing one condition in insert() like the invalid example).<p>What I take away from this is that people are mostly using OOP to cut-n-paste code when two things are similar.  I see the value in not wanting to rewrite code (or to create a third &quot;common factor&quot; that you will never use, to implement Set and Bag), but I think this use of OOP basically precludes any computer science reasoning when looking at your classes.  Apparently that&#x27;s not a problem, as people are ignoring Liskov right and left while building good stuff.  But thinking about it deeper, I fear that we didn&#x27;t find the right model when we invented OOP, and that is why newer languages are ignoring OOP in favor of composition."],"time":["2020-05-20 22:51:05"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["evdev"],"id":[23249252],"kids":[23249312],"parent":[23245125],"text":["Meta comment, but I would love for there to be more insight into the sociology of Hacker News.

Sure there are a couple EU-only projects and some attempts in Asia too, but the world&#x27;s biotech research and development still operates fundamentally within the system of American capitalism.

The Ivy League schools (and quite a few other liberal arts colleges that should be included in this argument) historically were playgrounds for the rich, with academics being one of the games.  No, Texas elite weren&#x27;t shooting for Baylor (unless they were of a particular religious stripe), the super-elites in Texas were shooting for the big Ivy&#x27;s, and next category was Rice. (Or Vanderbilt in Tennessee, etc.) Stanford has been an important elite institution in the US for a long time.<p>Meanwhile, the Ivy&#x27;s have moved in a dramatic way to be more inclusive with lots more minorities and scholarships. To the point about meritocracy, who cares?  If you pick an -ocracy on a less discriminatory basis, it&#x27;s still an -ocracy. I would argue that a less discriminatory -ocracy that&#x27;s more socially mobile is somewhat better than a more racist one that&#x27;s based more on accident of birth. Still possibly not good, but not as bad.<p>I&#x27;m sure there are companies where your job 5 years out of college still depends on where you went undergraduate, but really, you don&#x27;t get a shot if you&#x27;re not from one of the Ivy&#x27;s?  Hah. Most people are well aware that many public universities in this country offer great education to some or all of their students. Let&#x27;s just mention UC Berkely, UCLA, Rutgers, Michigan, Wisconsin, North Carolina, Texas (Austin) and so forth.  Degrees from these and many, many more institutions can be an entry to very lucrative and powerful positions. And please don&#x27;t forget Cal Tech, Purdue, West Point or Anapolis, etc. etc. (Oh, and maybe include YC)  Yeah, there&#x27;s something of a pecking order -- for several decades all of our presidents came from Yale, for example (well they were Bushes and Clinton) and certainly there&#x27;s a gradient of prestige. My point is, all this stuff about the &quot;Ivy&#x27;s&quot; is overstated and weakens the argument, which actually depends in no way on the assumption that the country is run by graduates of the institutions designated as &quot;Ivy&#x27;s&quot;.<p>Someone said that the Ivy&#x27;s developed their &quot;holistic&quot; admissions policy in the 30&#x27;s to prevent the schools from being overrun by Jews. That&#x27;s a stretch. My uncle, a Jew, actually managed to be admitted to one of the two (2) spots open to Jews at MIT at that time. (Remember, open discrimination was perfectly legal back then)  He turned it down, incidentally, and went on to build a very large chain of stores.  It was quotas and open racism and of course raw exclusion of women that were used to keep people out in the 30&#x27;s, actually. Today&#x27;s concepts of diversity were set up to avoid letting the Supreme Court&#x27;s Bakke decision exclude large parts of our society from the elite academic world, not to exclude those people.<p>I mention this because the Ivy League institutions are less discriminatory today.  You can equate the admission policy today to the 1930&#x27;s but it&#x27;s just not the same.  Yes there are still biases, but purposefully much less. No the perfect system isn&#x27;t at all perfect.  But going for perfection usually leads to disaster.  As Voltaire said, &quot;The perfect is the enemy of the better.&quot;<p>There are definitely problems with being ruled by an -ocracy, but what alternative is actually being proposed, other than doing what&#x27;s practical and sensible to open the -ocracy to broader participation and trying to limit its inevitable excesses of power?"],"time":["2020-05-20 23:42:38"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["fxtentacle"],"id":[23250251],"kids":[23250581],"parent":[23249782],"text":["TLDR: In a Meritocracy, the &quot;most talented&quot; rule over everyone else.

I&#x27;ve been using PHP7 for the last few months and yes, it is different from PHP4. You have optional static typing, you have better tools, a lot has changed. Yet deep in its core the language is still badly designed. I constantly find some weird behaviours that just don&#x27;t exist in other languages.<p>Example:<p><pre><code>  $array = [1,2,3,4]\n  array_filter($array, function($x) { return $x %2 === 0; });\n<\/code><\/pre>\nIn every other language I&#x27;ve used, such function would return [2,4], but not in PHP.<p><pre><code>  array_merge(\n    [ &quot;a&quot; =&gt; &quot;w&quot;, &quot;1&quot; =&gt; &quot;x&quot; ],\n    [ &quot;a&quot; =&gt; &quot;y&quot;, &quot;1&quot; =&gt; &quot;z&quot; ]\n  )\n<\/code><\/pre>\nIn every other language I know, it would return [ &quot;a&quot; =&gt; &quot;y&quot;, &quot;1&quot; =&gt; &quot;z&quot; ], but PHP returns [ &quot;a&quot; =&gt; &quot;y&quot;, 0 =&gt; &quot;x&quot;, 1 =&gt; &quot;z&quot; ]<p>I know, these are just random examples and every language has its quirks. The problem is that in PHP there are so many quirks I keep checking how each function works, because after half a year I still can&#x27;t remember them (and I don&#x27;t remember whether array is a first or a second argument, because it depends on a function).<p>I wouldn&#x27;t say that I hate PHP.

A lot has probably changed since, but I don&#x27;t know to what extent.<p>Surprisingly, the technical inconsistencies isn&#x27;t what I hated most about it. It&#x27;s rather the fact that questionable practice was rampant and largely left unchecked in its many communities. The only way to realize this is to join another community where peer review is severe enough and bullshit detection high enough that mediocrity is rarely given the opportunity to infect your practice for long and fester. A proper community is supposed to nurture you into becoming a better programmer, so that you can take those lessons and carry them with you wherever you decide to go next. By contrast, my experience with PHP over the 6 years or so that I used it was that you learn 3 things today and you&#x27;ll have to unlearn 2 tomorrow. Eventually I got fed up of the cyclical learning pattern and I moved on.<p>Some years after my move away from it, I decided to take a look back at some of the code that I had written with PHP. I was freshly appraising the sum of my past experience. I remember thinking that the language seemed to have a crisis of identity. It was dynamically and weakly typed, but with serious Java envy and so some of the less desirable aspects of Java were basically just cargoculted in, but in a shitty incomplete way. Private, protected, public class members, what a joke. If you&#x27;re a PHP programmer, did you ever ask yourself why would Python or Ruby programmers somehow be able to get by without this shit and not you? Do you know that because of the way its interpreter works there are some technical benefits for Java to have these besides the fallacious architectural &quot;advantages&quot; of hiding access from the programmer? Does the same thing apply to PHP? Interfaces and inheritance, without the possibility to overload methods, which can cause a lot of grief when a  zealous and inexperienced library designer hasn&#x27;t properly thought things through (which happened more than I&#x27;d like to remember in PHP projects). That was just at the language level, but many of the big frameworks followed suit with the Java obsession, by implementing a slew of circuitous patterns aimed at convincing programmers that they were now coding &quot;Enterprise Style&quot;. Front Controller, Action Controller, Dispatcher, and a whole other lot straight out of pattern catalogs. When you think about it, most of those efforts were fallacious in PHP. If the problems that you were trying to solve were beyond the constraints of what PHP is typically good for, namely cms-type admin web apps, then you were probably better off with another language. On the other hand, if they applied, why bother with all the enterprisey bullcrap? <i>But, but, but Facebook...<\/i> Ah, shut up! Even Facebook had to <i>invent<\/i> a whole other language to fix that mistake. The other projects that didn&#x27;t buy into this sort of architectural zeal went the other extreme, with their own experimentations and idiosyncrasies. Bastardizations of concepts that someone had seen somewhere else, but only half-understood, was common. Lots of Rails envy and no shortage of fame-driven wannabes that had failed to make a name for themselves in other communities, but somehow  always found a way to shine in PHP. Ensued just more bullshit.<p>Anyways, that was a long time ago. I hope things have changed. I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d be back if they did, in hindsight what PHP has for it is one of the easiest &quot;hello world&quot; tutorials, but you end up paying for years the half-hour you saved to see these two words on a web page.

Make it clear that we see ourselves not as a charity but as a citizen to citizen support network - today it could be that person, but tomorrow it could be you. We have to design around the dignity of the recipient and the donor.<p>2. We need to identify potential beneficiaries whose needs are verifiable. Which means involving organizations that work with migrant laborers at scale (to take a key demographic) and can verify and on-board those potential beneficiaries.<p>3. We need to pull together the back-end and front-end technology to make donations without intermediaries, i.e., there&#x27;s no middleman receiving and storing the money - it&#x27;s a direct transfer from one individuals account to another individual&#x27;s account. No administrative fees and with any luck we could even see if the credit card fees can be waived.<p>4.

A communications strategy that brings in donors and creates a democratic narrative around donations.<p>Each one of these needs several individuals and sometimes several organizations to collaborate and agree upon a course of action.

Every time I add a to-do&#x2F;task or an issue or use it as a bookmark manager, I am often presented with the question &quot;Could it be done any better?&quot;. It&#x27;s very important to get the tool out of your way if you follow any process like GTD.<p>My current workflow involves Taskwarrior + Joplin. I use TW for very very specific tasks and `task next` helps me plan my day. I use Joplin as my &quot;Notebook&quot; and have all my notes synced there. The default theme is a bit ugly, agreed, so I use &quot;Artim Dark&quot; with it. The biggest reason to choose Joplin was that it&#x27;s actively maintained, the apps are not great but decent I&#x27;d say, it lets me use the APIs and CLI tools to backup my Joplin DB and upload to remote storage periodically (in addition to the built in Dropbox sync), in case the sync doesn&#x27;t work some day. I also use Joplin Web Clipper Firefox extension to save bookmarks&#x2F;screenshots from website to a notebook &quot;Bookmarks&quot;. It can even store the whole webpage in your Notebook, which is beautifully rendered. It even has support for E2EE for notes, but I am yet to explore that. The search is based on SQLite FTS4 and it works <i>awesomely<\/i> well. There is a support for wildcard queries, and it basically searches across all your notebooks and is quite fast that too.\nAlso, I <i>love<\/i> writing in Markdown, and unlike Notion, this is really quick to launch, open a notebook and start writing ASAP without dealing with the cognitive overhead that Notion presents with it&#x27;s quirky &quot;Template&#x2F;Empty Page&quot; options. Did I mention that I can write notes in any editor (I use VS Code) and Joplin will simply `watch` for changes on that file and save it in your notebook? :D<p>So basically I am in full control of my data, something any Notion user can never claim. I also love the fact that the code is OSS, the APIs are open and it allows me to build tools on top of Joplin to use it the way I like.
