VSC is nice, and I tend to use it as my daily driver, but I experience a host of issues with it that I&#x27;ve never been able to solve. In no particular order:<p>- Autocomplete&#x2F;Intellisense&#x2F;whatever-you-call-it just stops working, constantly. This has persisted across many languages: Rust, C, PHP, Elixir, Java, Javascript, Typescript, Scala, ... despite having the relevant extensions installed. It&#x27;s incredibly frustrating. Reinstalling VSC, disabling all extensions, etc etc etc has made no change. I&#x27;ve found absolutely nothing that indicates what could possibly be the issue, and fixes I&#x27;ve found online haven&#x27;t helped. I admit I have a habit of leaving VSC open for days on end, but that shouldn&#x27;t impact anything -- Jetbrains IDEs work reliably for me under the same circumstances.<p>- Performance-wise, I find it slower. Sure, a window opens up fast, but that&#x27;s about it. I have a few extensions for symbol&#x2F;token colourisation (think rainbow parens, rainbow do&#x2F;end in Elixir, ...), since it makes it easier for me to read the code, and I find that these have a giant impact on its performance. Things like smooth scrolling -- which I like -- tend to lag out a <i>lot<\/i> for me when there&#x27;s a lot of text in the terminal, even when not coloured or anything. It&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m running this on a low-end machine, either; specs are R7 1800X &#x2F; GTX 1080 &#x2F; 64GB, so to me it&#x27;s absolutely inexcusable that it&#x27;s this slow.<p>- Unreadable themes are an issue I&#x27;ve run into, tho I understand this isn&#x27;t a VSC-specific issue. With VSC specifically, I can&#x27;t find a theme that actually has comments that feel readable to me -- I strongly dislike green comments, and all the themes I&#x27;ve looked at make comments a really low-contrast colour that blends into the editor background. I have neither the time nor the patience to make my own theme (or customise someone else&#x27;s), so using VSC just becomes frustrating at times because someone thought low-contrast comments were a good idea.<p>- Stuff like jump-to-definition, refactorings, ... are consistently either not-very-functional, or just don&#x27;t work. Jump-to-definition specifically <i>loves<\/i> to just give &quot;No definition found&quot; even when the relevant symbol is in the <i>same file<\/i>.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m doing something wrong, I don&#x27;t know. But I&#x27;ve used VSC for the last ~2 years and it&#x27;s been consistently far less usable for me than a Jetbrains IDE.

Naturally they had them work in remote areas.<p>* The real motivation is economic - the central planners simply  loved the flexibility of slave labor - they could start pet projects quickly. They wanted to complete vanity projects that made no economic sense like the Belomorcanal. Their need for hard currency also meant that they needed raw resources for export, most of which were in faraway, underdeveloped regions.<p>* Repressive organs found that they were strongly incentivised to send even more people to the camps.<p>* There was obviously no free media - which meant that any excess was covered up or spun as success - for example Gorky acknowledged that prisoners don&#x27;t have the proper skills or tools, but somehow claimed that ideology and superb management created wonders. This eventually emboldened the government to enslave even more people.<p>In short they created a slave economy. It wasn&#x27;t by design, in so far that the leaders of the country didn&#x27;t explicitly wish the return of slavery and serfdom, but there was a spiral of reinforcing incentives in the system.<p>Just like the USSR of the 20s and 30s China is desperate to create economic growth at all costs, will eventually run out of cheap rural labor[0], on which it used to rely for the last few decades and is not beholden to either national or international opinion. Who can stop the CPC from reintroducing slavery or serfdom? The Gulag system developed over 10 years to reach it its classical form, we may well see the first steps.<p>Economist Evsey Domar famously created a model where high labour demand and lots of available land creates incentives for landowners to reintroduce serfdom [1] as they didn&#x27;t want to compete with each other.

One that, imho, significantly regresses JSX as an independent syntax outside of React (i.e. makes it much more coupled to React than before):<p>JSX is an SGML&#x2F;XML-inspired syntax, and SGML&#x2F;XML are languages with 3 dimensions of element definition: names, attributes and children.<p>Internally, React elements are represented in 2 dimensions, with children managed as a &quot;magic&quot; attribute, with the reserved magic key &quot;children&quot; (this is for performance reasons I believe). Before now this has always been an implementation detail of React. JSX is flexible enough that other libraries could provide an element factory method with a fully featured 3-dimensional internal representation. This change removes that flexibility.<p>To clarify the change, currently JSX compiles to:<p><pre><code>  createElement(name, attributes, ...children);\n<\/code><\/pre>\nthe new transform is now:<p><pre><code>  _jsx(name, { ...attributes, children });<\/code><\/pre>"],"time":["2020-09-22 18:31:35"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["nojvek"],"id":[24563753],"kids":{},"parent":[24555415],"text":["I made some noise in a Typescript issue to not add more complexity just for React in the core but offer it as a plug-in but that didn’t go anywhere.<p>I do feel Typescipt tries to over-accommodate React compared to other frontend frameworks.

What would rx.js look like if this mechanism was available?<p>The current tooling makes experimenting with possible alternate use cases pretty awkward, and so basically no one is doing work in this area.<p>I believe that these changes, particularly the `jsx` and `jsxs` auto import,  will make it even harder to separate JSX as a concept from React and React-like libraries. It&#x27;ll make it harder to standardise JSX, which is frustrating as it&#x27;s the most supported ECMAScript syntax extension by a long way.<p>My modest proposal is that a JSX element desugars to a call to a block scoped identifier called `jsx`, so I can do something like this:<p><pre><code>    import { jsx } from &#x27;react&#x27;;\n    import { elementCreator } from &#x27;somelib&#x27;;\n\n    const someFunction = () =&gt; {\n      const { jsx } = elementCreator();\n\n      return &lt;iAmNotAReactElement &#x2F;&gt;;\n    };\n\n    const MyReactComponent = () =&gt; &lt;div&gt;cool&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;;\n\n<\/code><\/pre>\nTaking this alternative approach would give developers a widely supported syntax extension that could allow for some really innovative solutions.

Indeed, HNers and forward thinking devs here were the first comers to React, largely. I know I was on it pretty early (and walked a way more than once!) but the reality is its just picking up major steam in other places, the so called &#x27;shadow developer&#x27; communities, like large .NET shops that when I talk to them at conferences, desperately want to move away from Angular, and React is often a choice (Vue is gaining steam here too. I think this second order of developers will decide how big each get, IMO).<p>Through that lens, its amazing they&#x27;re taking these steps to find the balance between &#x27;magic&#x27; (auto imports!) and lessening the syntax you have to learn as you grow development. There are so many shops, in enterprise in particular, full of &#x27;shadow&#x27; developers most of us never meet or hear about, that are hungry for this kind of thing. Angular has some foot hold here, but Microsoft has been keen on trying to give alternatives, one of which is React (and MS here still has a lot of weight) and I think React will have  staying power and growth by making itself more appealing to these kinds of developers. These are the kinds of devs who still use jQuery in 2020 (not that its bad! I swear I don&#x27;t think that outright), even for new projects. There&#x27;s a ton of the web ecosystem that has not and does not develop with these things in mind.<p>I have witnessed this with hooks. Hooks made React more approachable to development teams I worked with because class components had an unintended side effect - Developers made all of the logic encapsulated by the component inside methods - where extracting functions would have been easier to test and been far more modular - simply because thats OOP to most devs (right or wrongly). So you&#x27;d end up with 10K line classes that do all kinds of byzantine things with extremely tight coupling.<p>With hooks, functions become the pattern, and the library (can we just call it a framework already?) really molds the developer into best practices of extracting components and using component composition.<p>Basically, if you aren&#x27;t just looking to reach the HN crowd, these changes are great. Thats been my experience so far. React has been growing in popularity at places I&#x27;ve worked and other developers I know see this too (many of which develop at consultancies, PHP&#x2F;Wordpress shops, .NET shops etc) because of the change of paradigms as well as stability, of course, have made it much more maintainable.<p>This says very little of the overall web ecosystem, which still has a major churn problem (same for the ecosystem around React, too much churn and breaking changes, over minimal upsides, I&#x27;ve observed)<p>Since I&#x27;m rambling, I wonder what React would look like if Web Components V1 was a thing when it first came out."],"time":["2020-09-22 22:15:33"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["tomasreimers"],"id":[24562811],"kids":[24562905],"parent":[24555415],"text":["This may be a silly question, but what are the major JS libraries outside of the react ecosystem that use JSX?

With some exceptions, I&#x27;m seeing .NET as predominantly an enterprise-focused technology. Strategizing about development of my MVP (B2B enterprise platform), as a CTO, I&#x27;m torn between a) Python and its great ecosystem (I plan to use FastAPI instead of more traditional Flask and Django), b) C# and .NET ecosystem and - to a lesser degree, for the reasons explained below - c) Julia and its emerging ecosystem.<p>As much as I&#x27;m excited about Julia, I think that both the language and the ecosystem have not yet reached enough maturity and critical mass of developers as well as comprehensive and stable general-purpose libraries and tools to be a safe choice for a startup, which is already a highly risky venture. I have to reduce risks, not add ones.<p>Between Python and .NET ecosystems, I&#x27;m more familiar with the former and, under equal conditions, would choose it over .NET. Additional argument in favor of this decision is that most of advanced ML&#x2F;AI development is focused on Python high-level interfaces (and ML&#x2F;AI is certainly a significant part of my future platform&#x27;s value proposition). However, based on my research and recent .NET experience, I recognize its advantages versus the Python stack in some areas, including native type system support (though <i>pydantic<\/i> might be good enough for the Python stack; plus, it is used by FastAPI), rich set of native APIs, much better performance, much better support for domain-driven design (DDD), WebAssembly support, and, finally, much better support for developing multi-tenant applications. The last item is especially important in my case, since multi-tenancy and other relevant features (e.g., auditability) are strict requirements and Python ecosystem pales in comparison with .NET in this regard (the only decent project that I ran across is <i>django-tenants<\/i>, but a) it would force me to use Django and b) it only supports PostgreSQL schema-based multi-tenancy approach).<p>Would love to hear your opinions and thoughts on the above.

Adler. The focus is on how to read for improved understanding rather than pleasure. There are many great ideas and tactics in the book but these are the ones that jump out for me:<p>- Not all books or even pages deserve to be read at the same speed or with the same care. Being able to identify which is which is a mark of a good reader<p>- If you don&#x27;t understand a word or passage, continue through it. Perhaps you will understand it with greater context. Even if you don&#x27;t, if the book as a whole turns out to be great then you should reread it, and if it doesn&#x27;t you can cast it aside with little harm.<p>- An &quot;inspectional reading&quot; (a.k.a. skimming) is a useful tool for understanding what a book is about without dedicating a lot of time.<p>- Write in the margins. This helps to make a book your own.<p>That last point has really been a game changer for me. I&#x27;ve generally tried to keep my books &quot;clean&quot; but writing in the margins, underling, etc. incredibly improves 2nd, 3rd, and so-on readings.<p>In general you can tell if you&#x27;ve properly read a book by seeing if you can answer the the following questions:<p>-What is the book about?<p>-What is being said in detail?<p>-Is it true?<p>-What of it?<p>I think it&#x27;s a neat idea to ask how we could improve books, but the assertion that books don&#x27;t work remains unproven to me after reading this book (and after my own experience).<p>Lastly, I think of books as a necessary but inadequate component of much learning. I think Montaigne put it well (btw i read this in a book :)):<p>&gt; To know by rote, is no knowledge, and signifies no more but only to retain what one has intrusted to our memory. That which a man rightly knows and understands, he is the free disposer of at his own full liberty, without any regard to the author from whence he had it, or fumbling over the leaves of his book.

Know how to cope with your learning style. Visual, Auditory, Verbal, Structural, etc. Go get a full battery IQ test.

One may reinforce letters, or a more advanced one may reinforce words, or later how they are used in sentences, then vocabulary, and so on until a point when the child has developed the skill to read unassisted. One could argue that the entire fiction genre is merely a roundabout way of reinforcing vocabulary (if one is inclined to do a cynical utilitarian take on the knowledge value they provide).<p>Extending from that, it seems a bit presumptuous to assume that a single book might then be able to convey all there is to any topic due to its size (compared to, say, listicles), given that reading itself is one of the most basic skills and one that - as we&#x27;ve seen - cannot generally be taught with a single book.<p>What books can do is expose you to some idea, in some form, so that you can soak up something from it and adopt it into your own mental framework. Pop culture &#x2F; self-help books will often try to &quot;sell&quot; a central idea by showering you with stories and anecdotes (e.g. the 1-2-3 system in parenting books), but if you have the presence of mind to already understand that the examples are merely an attempt to add weight to an argument, then you can quickly summarize the meat (the &quot;1-2-3&quot;, in this case) and think for yourself whether&#x2F;when to apply that technique, vs other techniques that you might learn elsewhere.<p>There&#x27;s a slippery slope in terms of how many core ideas one may pack in a book, vs how many supporting arguments one may add around the core idea. Add too many core ideas and you get something like a dry university textbook. Add too little, and you get books like Malcolm Gladwell. Mind you, having a lot of &quot;frills&quot; doesn&#x27;t necessarily make a book bad. For example, many consider Godel, Escher, Bach to be a great read, even though [spoiler] it can be promptly summarized as an exploration on occurrences of recursiveness (through very colorful allegory). The beauty of GEB is that the supporting stories themselves give you a glimpse of new domains to explore.<p>At the end of the day, just like a library is a collection of disparate nuggets of human knowledge and no one&#x27;s expected to uniformly learn all of it, books are but pieces of an ecosystem, with various degrees of &quot;completeness&quot; (as far as their core subjects go) and various degrees of flair; what one chooses to read or skim, and what they take away individually from each book is what the relationship between humans and books are all about."],"time":["2020-09-22 17:22:31"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["simplegeek"],"id":[24558021],"kids":{},"parent":[24542224],"text":["If you want to tell me &quot;I tried X, and it doesn&#x27;t work.&quot; My first reaction is, &quot;How did you do X?&quot;<p>I feel author should have also explained how did he read those books.<p>Without knowing that, it&#x27;s hard to see how exactly things didn&#x27;t work."],"time":["2020-09-22 20:18:43"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["drenvuk"],"id":[24553546],"kids":{},"parent":[24542224],"text":["What about instead of chapters you break books down into concepts.

To the consumer of such a file, there is no difference between that and a file with the first 300M lines cut off.

But as this is a database reload situation (expand the comments in the question to see this), this is unlikely to be the case.<p>(In a truly desperate situation, you could grab your favorite scripting language that has FUSE support and set up a special-purpose one-file FUSE filesystem that serves that one file with the front cut off and translates all seeks correctly. It&#x27;s probably easier than you think, but certainly I&#x27;d have to be backed into a corner pretty hard to do this.)<p>The upshot is, files aren&#x27;t files, or to put it another way, the file!interface isn&#x27;t the same as files!disk. File!interface is an interface that allows you to read, write, seek, etc. and files!disk are a particular implementation of a bag of bytes on disk, and despite using the same name, it&#x27;s important to keep them straight. The user doesn&#x27;t need a file!disk that does what need, they need a file!interface that will serve the contents they need. It is much easier to get the file!interface than the file!disk in this situation.<p>Or to put it another another way, it&#x27;s all just numbers. Files have no ontological existence, really. It&#x27;s all just a question of what numbers will be returned by a &quot;read&quot;. If you return the right numbers, you have the &quot;right&quot; file, <i>regardless of how those right numbers appeared<\/i>. I realize this may sound simple and obvious when I say it, but it is a major mental block that almost all junior programmers and a fair number of mid-level programmers have. It especially causes problems when you&#x27;re a network programmer doing network things; you really need to understand that in the end, it&#x27;s all just numbers, and as long as you consume the correct numbers, and produce the correct numbers, the right things will happen.<p>(The simplest case of this was when I produced a network server on port 80 that, if you poked it with the correct magic sequence, did the thing it was supposed to do, but if you did anything else, returned a hard-coded byte string that &quot;happened&quot; to be an HTTP response that said what you did wrong and how to fix it, completely ignoring the rest of the &quot;request&quot;, including ignoring if it was even HTTP at all. You don&#x27;t need an HTTP library to produce an HTTP response, you just need to produce the right numbers on the TCP stream.

I&#x27;ll 1) give an example of why I think this useful and 2) the the type of meeting I think would make sense for this purpose:<p>1) My group has been all remote since March. In June, we got a new boss, and we&#x27;ve been meeting remotely, phone conversations, etc. It worked out find. But then in August my boss needed to drop something off at my home. She came to my house, mask on, and gave me the technical documents I needed, and then we stood outside for about half an hour just talking, about family, kids, work, whatever. This meeting transformed my sense of our working relationship. A person who had been a face on a screen suddenly felt much more real, much more like a living breathing person. Of course I knew they were &quot;real&quot; before, but that brief in-person meeting really made a difference.<p>2) Normal meetings are not the appropriate format for something like. I think they should be more social, less structured in nature. Perhaps something like a once-monthly extended lunch-meeting that would just be a free flowing discussion of active projects, no agenda, just lunch &amp; discussion. If things veer off of work topics, so be it. If the remote workers are really scattered, it could be done once every 6 months or so.<p>I recognize that there are personalities that don&#x27;t need&#x2F;want&#x2F;benefit much from this sort of interaction.

After talking to a couple principal engineers it was revealed that since I was currently bay area based I would be expected to be in the office 3-5 days a week, so no they weren&#x27;t remote. I wrote it off because I am not interested in spending 20-30 hours a week commuting for any job.<p>A few months later, post the start of COVID, I heard that they were now really remote. I re-engaged and again inquired. It turned out that the job was only remote until COVID was over, again, after COVID they would want in-person presence in the office 3-5 days a week. This despite the team being globally distributed. Again I declined to pursue.<p>Then I started to see tweets advertising remote positions in the same group. I was asked on twitter by a former co-worker who works in the same overall organization if I was interested and I explained that I had already investigated and the lack of ability to work remote was a non-starter. He encouraged me to investigate again with his reference. The result was the same as before, London or Cupertino. Being truly remote or WFH in the bay area would only work until COVID was over. 1-2 weeks a quarter in the office was insufficient. I declined to pursue. Even the former co-worker was surprised that they weren&#x27;t more flexible.<p>I am not sure what the problem is at Apple. They have had issues with remote work for a long time. I recall one incident where they fired a firmware engineer working on the CHRP Macs because he had to move to Montana (spousal or family reasons) and in the process really screwed themselves. A significant part of the CHRP project delays were because they blew a hole in their own firmware team. There had been a couple of people I knew working remote at the time Steve returned to Apple. All of them were let go if they didn&#x27;t return to Cupertino. This had been a problem even before Steve&#x27;s return though. Some of it is their silo &quot;super sekrit&quot; culture. It doesn&#x27;t seem to have changed over the years.<p>In the end, Apple is entitled to have whatever culture they want. I have been a remote WFH since 1997.

The experience was terrible.  Constant noise, incredibly inconsiderate people leaving trash everywhere, etc. The interesting thing is the short-term units weren&#x27;t cheap; they were actually rather expensive.

I spoke to some of our neighbors (who owned their homes, they were not renting units like we were) and they expressed the difficulty they&#x27;d had with the short-term guests in our building.

The same thing (to a worse degree) has happened in Athens, where the supply of rental units has diminished to more than 1&#x2F;3 (with average rents going 2-3x in a 1-2 year period), as landlords converted units to short-term rentals. This is particularly touchy for Greece, as tourism accounts for 25%+ of GDP, so tourist-friendly regulation has a big impact. OTOH, it&#x27;s a country with one of the lowest average wages in the EU, which means that the rent increases has made the situation unlivable. Example: average net monthly salary is something in the 800-1000 EUR range, with 300EUR renting you something decent 5 years ago. Today, not only it&#x27;s much harder to find vacant rental units, but their prices have also bumped to 600-700 EUR.<p>IMO, the best approach to this is similar to what the city of Santa Monica has -- hosts can only rent a room in a property (i.e. no &quot;entire house to yourself&quot;), i.e. similar to the couchsurfing model.

They?re wrong, all wrong, of course, and contrary to reason; but in the face of them my reason tells me, wrong and most wrong, that to dream and live illusions gives greater delight. And after all, delight is the wage for living. Without delight, living is a worthless act. To labour at living and be unpaid is worse than to be dead. He who delights the most lives the most, and your dreams and unrealities are less disturbing to you and more gratifying than are my facts to me.? He shook his head slowly, pondering. ?I often doubt, I often doubt, the worthwhileness of reason. Dreams must be more substantial and satisfying. Emotional delight is more filling and lasting than intellectual delight; and, besides, you pay for your moments of intellectual delight by having the blues. Emotional delight is followed by no more than jaded senses which speedily recuperate. I envy you, I envy you.? He stopped abruptly, and then on his lips formed one of his strange quizzical smiles, as he added: ?It?s from my brain I envy you, take notice, and not from my heart. My reason dictates it. The envy is an intellectual product. I am like a sober man looking upon drunken men, and, greatly weary, wishing he, too, were drunk.? ?Or like a wise man looking upon fools and wishing he, too, were a fool,? I laughed. ?Quite so,? he said. ?You are a blessed, bankrupt pair of fools. You have no facts in your pocketbook.? ?Yet we spend as freely as you,? was Maud Brewster?s contribution. ?More freely, because it costs you nothing.? ?And because we draw upon eternity,? she retorted. ?Whether you do or think you do, it?s the same thing.

First, what are the factors that really govern the interests involved, rationally considered?<p>2. Second, what are the subconscious influences where the brain at a subconscious level is\nautomatically doing these things?which by and large are useful, but which often malfunctions?<p>To do this requires you to divorce process from outcome.
