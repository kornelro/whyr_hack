There&#x27;s a lot to like in React, but I constantly wonder whether I&#x27;ve joined a cult. Somebody learned a couple of cute tricks and wants to use them _everywhere_, no matter if they fit the situation or not. Because of this there are a lot of do&#x27;s and dont&#x27;s that probably could be avoided with a different design. And there is a lot of gray area in between, specific things the React manual wants me to avoid but in the end I cannot (and I have to quote a whole lot of blog posts from various known React developers to my code reviewer to prove they were really necessary).<p>Classes have their failings and inexperienced (or overzealous) developers can often turn them into a big mess. These are also well known problems to the computer science community that has come up with a number of ways to manage the mess. Hooks are just a completely React concept where no previous knowledge has any use. Despite looking innocent they have a load of problems and peculiarities, just like classes and methods do. I constantly wonder why they had to go and reinvent the wheel and currently still do not feel like it was worth it.<p>Learning new things is great and I am glad I got the chance to learn React and its hooks. Now that the project is slowly coming to an end however I am also glad I will soon start learning something else, perhaps something a little less specific to a particular ecosystem."],"time":["2020-09-03 21:06:24"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["axegon_"],"id":[24363695],"kids":{},"parent":[24363261],"text":["It is true. Full disclosure - I&#x27;m very inexperienced when it comes to javascript - it is on par with my German skills - I can do basic shopping, order a coffee or get a bus ticket, get from A to B but that&#x27;s it. But I do feel like it&#x27;s been a black box by design from the start. At the end of the day, we are talking about transpiling code. Which is fine(depending on the definition of transpiling to begin with). If we look at how C affected Assembly, there&#x27;s no question that the appearance of C skyrocketed the entire CS field in general: Even the most basic of &quot;hello world&quot; programs is a testimony of that. At this point Assembly is in the Cobol universe - a handful of people know it to an extent at which they can work with it. But in the case of React... That really isn&#x27;t the case - the fundamental problem I see with React(and the entire NPM universe for that matter) is that they try to make a simple solution more simple by making it more complicated and convoluted. On a more general note, the web is broken. It has gone against it&#x27;s core principles and design. HTML was meant to serve readable documents and that&#x27;s it. Javascript&#x27;s purpose was to add some interactivity. But in this day and age, according to reacters anyway, HTML is pretty much Assembly or Cobol, while javascript is C. Which in theory sounds great as far as the analogy goes but in the real world, javascript&#x27;s purpose was never to take over. It&#x27;s purpose was to supplement. The flaws in React(and all other 5000000 frameworks) are a symptom of it, not the cause."],"time":["2020-09-03 15:14:09"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["anilakar"],"id":[24363928],"kids":{},"parent":[24363261],"text":["Being a &quot;black box&quot; is good.

It&#x27;s consumers and ordinary investors that pay the cost in terms of higher spreads.<p>You can think of the bid-ask spread as the cost of liquidity. It&#x27;s how much more you pay for immediate execution. The tick size therefore acts like a price floor on the cost of liquidity. Why are we imposing a price floor, one that&#x27;s much higher than the free market price, on end-consumers? If we reduced tick sizes from $0.01 to $0.001, the cost of trading for most retail investors on most stocks would fall by 50% or more.<p>It blunts the price discovery process. It incentives HFTs to compete in an arms race of speed to capture queue position, rather than provide better prices.

I remember vividly being active on various eMule mod forums back in ~2005. There was a very active scene back then with some eMule Mods that really pushed things further, MorphXT, Xtreme, StulleMule, eFmod, Sivka, ionix, NeoMule and ScarAngel come to mind.<p>So much drama with leecher mods (leecher was negatively connotated in regards to the ed2k-protocol) that tried to download more than uploading or upload to clients only that had proven to pay back with higher speeds. But also really innovative ideas like downloading from clients that used a thin HTTP server within the client, leveraging your ISPs proxies (Webcache&#x2F;Peercache feature) for higher download speeds. Also so many discussions where the network should be heading with the main Client devs famously mute in regards to those discussions and drama.<p>The main benefits of eMule&#x2F;ed2K, compared to torrenting, were file discoverability (serverless thanks to Kad search) and longetivity of files. It was actually relatively hard to find a file that was dead, because people kept sharing as long as they downloaded, often much longer. Download speeds were much slower than Torrents, even back then, and that was an advantage because that kept so many files alive. Great times that basically ended because of „p2p sheriff“ companies, Torrents and the dawn of One Click Hosters like Rapidshare that promised privacy and better download speeds.<p>To this day I am wondering if eMule would still have an active userbase if it had some sort of mechanism that (via opt-in) allowed clients to download from trustworthy „friends“ only and pipelined those downloads from the „public“ ed2k network through these friends and their friends&#x27; networks.

I&#x27;ve used exclusively Vim for over 10 years and it&#x27;s too comfortable to switch to anything else, so I&#x27;m losing out on a lot of productivity, or at least that&#x27;s what my colleagues, who have never used Vim, claim.<p>Pithy claims aside, it has been an interesting journey actually using Vim for producing C++ code for large projects. There&#x27;s a strong DIY element and you end up with a setup that&#x27;s much more customised than a vanilla IDE - on the one hand giving you a certain degree of comfort in your work, but on the other a lot of what you do is unportable to other people. The language server protocol has been a pretty good development, I&#x27;m keeping an eye on what comes out of those efforts, though I&#x27;m not using one personally right now.<p>My current setup consists mainly of exuberant-ctags for static indexing, YouCompleteMe for intellisense and simple navigation, rtags for rich search and light refactoring and fzf for searching. As to why I ended up settling on these plugins:<p>- ctags:<p>Absolutely essential. Yes, a full semantic index straight from the compiler is better, but ctags is more than good enough for just telling you &quot;where is this defined&quot;. When paired with fzf, you can type part of the tag, space, part of the directory and you&#x27;ll get all tags in that directory. That&#x27;s due to fzf doing super simple substring matching in the TAGS file&#x27;s lines based on your query, there&#x27;s nothing smart going on here. This tool is also very good when you are developing multiplatform software, because the compiler cannot see all places where a function or class is defined, since you have one definition per platform. Technically being able to query a plethora of language servers, one for each configuration, would be ideal, but we&#x27;re not there yet, and such a setup sounds way too fragile for my taste.<p>- YouCompleteMe:<p>Aside from C++, it provides amazing completion support for many other languages. It can even deal with java project files, if the readme is to be believed. Other than for C++, I mainly use it for python. It&#x27;s also good in plaintext files for completing words and file paths. I really love its substring matcher, just type gTFBT to get &quot;getTheFooBarThing&quot;. Downsides: 1. if your build system cannot produce a compile_commands.json file, you will need to write some python code to specify compilation flags; 2. compiles each file individually, so if some of your headers aren&#x27;t freestanding, you&#x27;ll get spurious errors when editing them.<p>- rtags:<p>Basically a language server from before the LSP protocol existed. Mainly developed for Emacs, but the Vim integration is good enough. Continuously indexes your source based on a compile_commands.json file. It can show you who calls a function or uses a variable, class hierarchies, virtual method overloads and more. I&#x27;ve seen it get confused if you jump branches and require you to delete and recreate the index, but I haven&#x27;t experienced that lately.<p>Apart from those I use a bunch of standard productivity plugins like unimpaired, surround, nerdtree, etc. etc. Vim 8&#x27;s gdb integration has been very welcome, too. I struggled to find a good interface to gdb previously, as everything seems to want to be Visual Studio and give you a restricted clicky interface, whereas I just wanted the current vim buffer to be synchronised with the instruction pointer and to write gdb commands directly.<p>I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m substantially slower in Vim than my colleagues in other editors and IDEs. Colleagues across the company use Vim, Emacs, VSCode, QtCreator, and Code::Blocks. The Windows developers are all on Visual Studio naturally. I haven&#x27;t noticed being slower than any of them. The above plugins are enough for the odd rename-refactor I have to do, and anything more substantial is so infrequent, that doing it manually doesn&#x27;t really have an impact. Also, developing on Linux, I always feel like any graphical application will just disintegrate or cause an unrecoverable freeze in the graphics driver at any random keystroke.<p>Back in the day I had to make do with just ctags, cscope and debugging straight from the commandline, lol. I do believe that Stallman&#x27;s refusal to allow easily plugging into GCC&#x27;s AST, like one can just use clang for indexing, held back C++ development tools on the Linux platform significantly. Eclipse&#x27;s CDT, KDevelop, Anjuta, Code::Blocks, NetBeans, etc. - they all suffered from having to write their own C++ indexers that were always inferior to getting semantic information straight from the compiler. I&#x27;m extremely grateful to the open-source community for the continuing work on development tools, and try to donate where I can. Watching the development tools landscape change over the years has been interesting - things don&#x27;t so much improve, as they evolve chaotically with an overall trend towards improvement. Like anything else on this platform. So far many IDEs have come and gone, but Vim is eternal.<p>I will say that using Vim is entirely up to your taste, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be substantially faster or slower than an IDE, so use what you like. It is much cheaper than Qt Creator or CLion (AFAIK for both you need a license to develop commercial software), so that might be a factor for you. Companies tend to have a big Windows development team, with a few Linux developers, so they buy bulk Visual Studio licenses and individual Linux IDE licenses, making the latter end up costing more per developer."],"time":["2020-09-03 21:34:28"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["parhamn"],"id":[24363960],"kids":[24364513],"parent":[24363225],"text":["Is there a LSPs in a box somewhere yet?"],"time":["2020-09-03 15:44:42"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["wffurr"],"id":[24364218],"kids":{},"parent":[24363225],"text":["I didn&#x27;t think setting up YCM was too bad.

For most of the time when I worked at Optimizely, the company was all the rage. It appeared at the top of most &quot;hot startup&quot; lists, the Glassdoor reviews were 5&#x2F;5, revenue was skyrocketing, and for a period in 2014 it became the fourth most valuable YCombinator company (after Stripe, AirBnB, and Dropbox).\nOf course, Optimizely&#x27;s success was&#x27;t guaranteed. In 2015, the company abandoned the self-serve market that had driven its original momentum and pivoted instead to vague and indefinite enterprise offerings that were (and are) hidden behind schizophrenic marketing, an impossible sales process, terrible customer service and a general approach of trying to extract the maximum amount of money from clients rather than providing them with value. From 2015 on, everything (including the internal culture) became mumbo-jumbo, a cloud of dishonesty. I used to be able to explain what Optimizely did to my grandmother; now I don&#x27;t even really understand it myself.<p>Th Episerver acquisition is indeed a bad exit, and I think I will lose &gt;$100k in stock I exercised (which is OK, I&#x27;ll be fine). But I hope all readers will take from this saga a lesson in humility and the pitfalls of intellectual dishonesty and hubris. Just because your startup is skyrocketing isn&#x27;t enough. Success is not guaranteed. Your company&#x27;s leadership needs to be honest with itself, which Optimizely&#x27;s leadership was not.

First off, congrats to Optimizely &#x2F; Dan and co for the acquisition. For us Optimizely has always been a role model, especially from the technical side of things (I&#x27;m the founder of Kameleoon, but currently serving as CTO, so obviously I have a tech background). Optimizely was (and still is, in many ways) a great platform. And it did create (or at least, heavily helped develop) a whole market.\nHowever I agree with Feynman&#x27;s comment, the main problem with this company (and even looking from aside, it was quite obvious for us) was that they raised way too much money and made promises to their investors that were completely impossible to fulfill. Basically, it looked like they wanted to be compared to AirBNB, but their potential was honestly never the same, and this was quite clear from someone with a little insight into the business. Because of that, they started making mistakes after mistakes, burned way too much money and it all went downhill.<p>They&#x27;re not the only ones with that problem - almost all competitors &#x2F; actors in the field raised too much for the side of the market, from my opinion. Dynamic Yield is probably the one that did the best at that game, with a great exit when the hype was at its peak. But all the other ones are clearly in trouble (even Optimizely exit, I am sure, is clearly not a success for their investors, etc). The only actor that has a reasonable overall strategy is VWO (somebody asked if they&#x27;re were profitable - of course they are, since they did not receive any funding, they have to. While Optimizely clearly never was), because it stayed lean and avoided the pitfalls of over investments (going to all continents on the planet, having 20 offices all over the world, etc). Hats off to Paras for that. We try to stick to the same strategy at Kameleoon, even if we had to raise a bit of capital. But you don&#x27;t need to raise $200 millions to have a great CRO platform - we proved this for a fact.<p>About the switch to Enterprise - anyone in this industry will tell you it was absolutely necessary. Impossible to sell experimentation to SMB and expect to be profitable, you need larger customers. Because contrarily to Mailchimp for instance, a SMB customer paying $50 (or even $500) per month for a CRO platform won&#x27;t be able to operate it on its own and will churn. The problem with Optimizely pivot to Enterprise is not the pivot in itself, it&#x27;s how they did it (I heard some horrors stories from people inside Optimizely, not sure if they are true, but one thing is clear - it did not go well).<p>Anyway, it&#x27;s still an exciting field, from the technical side of things, there are still many innovations to be done and we hope to spearhead that at Kameleoon :-)"],"time":["2020-09-04 13:46:10"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["designium"],"id":[24366183],"kids":[24366904,24366608],"parent":[24365479],"text":["I hope the founder exited well.

I&#x27;ll be grateful for the experience of selling experimentation into the European market, even if Optimizely was on a flat trajectory.  It is one of the most difficult things to sell.  The problem with experimentation is you are selling hard work.  Everyone says they want to be data-driven, but no one wants to do hard work.  No one wants to tell an executive he&#x2F;she is wrong and their idea sucks.  No one wants to do the work of building a culture.  It is akin to selling religion.<p>I&#x27;ll be most proud of the companies I sold to that then started doing internal webinars on how to do hypothesis-driven product development and really engaging in bottoms-up approach to experimentation.  Those deals took 12-36 months to close, but you felt like you were changing how they ran their business.<p>I see a lot of folks throwing shade on Optimizely here.  I think that is ridiculous.  Not many companies can grow to 300 employees and over $75 million in annual revenues.  Even fewer companies get to IPO.  Everyone&#x27;s thoughts about how Optimizely used to be worth more are BS.  Valuations are perceptions of product&#x2F;market strength rather than the reality. We shouldn&#x27;t be looking at this as a failure.  Rather we should look at this as a natural course of a business finding its product&#x2F;market fit.<p>Form a market perspective, Optimizely was hemmed in by big players like Adobe and Oracle who bought competitors to round out their marketing suites.  Adobe and Oracle do not care about their experimentation products and will give it away for pennies, so it isn&#x27;t like they are driving innovation. On the low-end, Optimizely created a bunch of fast followers.  VWO, ABTasty and Kameleoon, just to name a few copied not only the Optimizely tech but also their marketing in some cases and then just sold for cheaper.  Ultimately, the market decided that Experimentation technology just wasn&#x27;t super valuable (you still need to generate the test idea yourself).  The technology could be copied easily and many people didn&#x27;t care enough about it to change their cultures.<p>Outside of the market forces, Optimizely definitely made some mistakes.  You could make the argument that pricing and product development had issues in the past few years.<p>I think those were not the core issues.  I think the basic mistakes they made were in execution.  It is less sexy to talk about but ultimately if you have a great product and a need in the market, you still can&#x27;t win if you don&#x27;t execute properly.<p>Marketing execution was poor, Sales enablement was haphazard, Partnerships with other tech firms or agencies changed almost daily, and culturally, the organisation struggled to maintain the original culture it had around transparency.  It failed to realise that competitors had caught up to a bunch of core functionality it thought was unique.  It failed to market the new features that were differentiable.  It is easy to blame pricing or moving into &quot;enterprise&quot; as the issue because that is what people see on the outside.  I think that is unfair.  Many companies have done the same thing and it worked.  It is all down to execution.<p>Ultimately, I think Optimizely built a real market and culture in the tech world that experimentation matters and data matters.  The fact that you have a ton of copycat companies prove that others see it as valuable as well (I wonder how they&#x27;ll fair in the future).  Regardless of where it goes as part of Episerver, it will have brought loads of people into the world of experimentation, and I think that is a good thing for the world."],"time":["2020-09-04 11:43:50"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[24365892],"kids":{},"parent":[24365479],"text":{},"time":["2020-09-03 18:43:31"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":["neonate"],"id":[24366609],"kids":{},"parent":[24365479],"text":["<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.is&#x2F;Sz20v\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.is&#x2F;Sz20v<\/a>"],"time":["2020-09-03 19:49:07"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["dblooman"],"id":[24369440],"kids":[24371782,24374946,24369529,24373098,24374582,24369925],"parent":[24365479],"text":["Any alternatives to Optimizely?"],"time":["2020-09-04 00:08:27"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["scottmcleod"],"id":[24370849],"kids":{},"parent":[24365479],"text":["Shot themself in the foot.

The court only found that a single program exposed by Snowden was illegal.  Snowden released a bunch of other information that was a violation of the NDA he signed when he was given a security clearance.<p>2. Even if all the information he disclosed revealed illegal activity, Snowden&#x27;s actions make him ineligible for whistleblower protection.  Whistleblower protection for the intelligence community[1] is only provided if a person follows the proper procedure to securely notify their Inspector General and&#x2F;or Congress.  Since he&#x27;s not automatically protected, it would take Congress or the President to decide to offer him protection.  Snowden (allegedly) did not even attempt to notify the proper authorities before going public with the information, so not only is he ineligible, it&#x27;s not likely that anyone will take pity on him.<p>3. There&#x27;s a chance that this ruling won&#x27;t stick as the legal system chugs along and a few more judges look at it, and even if they were willing to help Snowden, nobody in Congress is going to take action until there is some permanence with the ruling. IANAL, but I think this would be decided if the Supreme Court either decides to decline or hear the case.  If it&#x27;s declined, then it&#x27;s pretty much final.  If they decide to hear the case, then it could be another year or so before they make a decision.<p>[1] IC whistleblower protection is a little different than standard whistleblower protection: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Intelligence_Community_Whistleblower_Protection_Act\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Intelligence_Community_Whistle...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-09-03 13:23:51"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["harry8"],"id":[24363072],"kids":{},"parent":[24362047],"text":["Crimes are no issue for the persecution of Snowden.<p>Clapper lied, on camera, under oath, admitted it and has had zero consequences.

Making the loading  of associations an explicit decision is also the right way to go. The Rails community has good experience with performance surprises of automatic loading of relationships.<p>Personally I found the most useful ORM in Ecto for the Elixir (Erlang) language: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hexdocs.pm&#x2F;ecto&#x2F;Ecto.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hexdocs.pm&#x2F;ecto&#x2F;Ecto.html<\/a> (ignoring the query capability). It follows very much the repository pattern like Kiss ORM. The API is a bit more succinct  (you only define a schema for each table and use a generic repository instead of subclassing for each table) but that might be possible only due to Elixir&#x27;s language capabilities like meta-programming.<p>One piece of Ecto that might be a win to implement in Kiss ORM is the &quot;Changeset&quot; pattern to give a canonical, succinct and productive solution to validate data (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hexdocs.pm&#x2F;ecto&#x2F;Ecto.Changeset.html#content\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hexdocs.pm&#x2F;ecto&#x2F;Ecto.Changeset.html#content<\/a>). For example have a look at how Ecto unifies validation (checked without hitting the DB) and constraints (checked by hitting the DB) in a single API.

I&#x27;m pretty happy&#x2F;relieved to see other people playing around in the same space.<p>My perspective was (and is) that for portable devices (phones&#x2F;laptops) that are interfacing with locally hosted services, having SSL for those services is really important because your device probably isn&#x27;t configured to check what network it&#x27;s on before automatically pinging 192.168.1.x. This is doubly important if you have other people occasionally hopping onto your network and connecting to those same services. It&#x27;s imo bad practice to ask everyone connecting to your network to install certificates or set up a certificate manager. I wouldn&#x27;t do that for any of my personal devices if someone asked me to.<p>To push this a step farther, I imagined a world where my services could handle not just renewing their own certificates, but also updating their addresses if they were moved to a different network&#x2F;address.

Every time when I would like to use my phone I make a pause and think about the intention and validating it before using. I was writing this intention right into the app which popup with input form after every unlock(pop up is only on Android, on iOS user have to manually go to the app). I found several usage patterns in my usages and then I created plans for every pattern &quot;How to deal with it&quot;. And I don&#x27;t need to delete all apps from my phone to use my smartphone less, instead, it&#x27;s a chance to investigate how do I use it and then adapt and get best from these apps.

People had observed objects at rest staying there; that&#x27;s why you can sit on a chair.  But they had also observed that any object in motion (except for those in the sky) slowed down and eventually stopped, unless you kept pushing them.  Newton attributed this to friction.<p>This theory--which contradicted what people could plainly observe with their eyes--is what makes possible satellites (and keeps the moon in orbit), since being outside the atmosphere, they experience very little friction.  Of course the other thing necessary for man-made satellites is a way to get them moving fast enough, for which Newton&#x27;s third law comes in handy (it&#x27;s why rockets accelerate, even outside the atmosphere)."],"time":["2020-09-04 03:24:04"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["PaulHoule"],"id":[24364773],"kids":[24366257],"parent":[24362974],"text":["See<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Dean_drive\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Dean_drive<\/a><p>particularly this article<p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rexresearch.com&#x2F;dean&#x2F;stine.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rexresearch.com&#x2F;dean&#x2F;stine.htm<\/a>"],"time":["2020-09-03 17:09:21"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mnw21cam"],"id":[24365467],"kids":{},"parent":[24362974],"text":["So, <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;955&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;955&#x2F;<\/a> appears to be relevant.

But I think it is a fallacy to believe that as a consequence &quot;concurrency is easy&quot; in a general way. These tools still require the programmer to be aware of the challenges of concurrency. They do make it more easy to deal with them.<p>It is the same story as with garbage collection. Garbage collection prevents some kinds of errors and in general makes it way more easy to deal with dynamic memory allocations. However, garbage collections does not mean you don&#x27;t have to think about allocation patters and object lifetime for example.<p>Go does make concurrency much easier by the tools it provides. Most importantly are goroutines, which are very lightweight, so within reasonable limits, you don&#x27;t have to be concerned about the number of goroutines you spawen - but as the example shows, you shouldn&#x27;t try to spawn more goroutines as there are file handles available to your process, if every goroutine allocates a file handle. Not only are goroutines very lightweight with small growable stacks, but as they are part of the language specification, the compiler can generate code which helps with scheduling, in most cases you have efficient cooperative sheduling, so thread-based preemption is less frequent.<p>On top of that, channels provide a very easy to use abstraction for communication between goroutines. There are a lot of use cases, where goroutines and channels give you very easy and safe concurrency. It does not save you from understanding concurrency issues and especially deadlocks. Which in a general sense is impossible to achieve, because to prove that a program is deadlock-free would require to prove that all goroutines return and that is equivalent to the halting problem, which is unsolveable.<p>It should also not be underestimated, that due to goroutines and channels being part of the language spec, these are very commonly used features. Concurrency is present in most Go programs. As a consequence, when one reads a lot of Go code, there will be plenty examples of their usage.

I was disappointed at just how <i>not<\/i> easy it was.<p>For example, Go has no generic support for atomic primitives, arrays, slices, or maps. It has sync&#x2F;atomic, but it&#x27;s not generic. I always reach for Uber&#x27;s atomic library, which has typesafe atomic wrappers such as atomic.Bool. They&#x27;re so common, you&#x27;d think a CSP-aware language would provide keywords declare things atomic:<p><pre><code>  var b atomic[bool]\n  if cas(b, false, true) {\n    ...\n  }\n<\/code><\/pre>\n&quot;Classical&quot; Go didn&#x27;t have errgroups, contexts or cancellation. To build something truly robust, &quot;modern&quot; Go ends up involving all three (plus atomics, of course). That&#x27;s because almost all complex situations need to build what are effectively nested trees of goroutines that all need to quickly abort and unwind on errors or panics.<p>But as you use more and more of these primitives, your code (or at least my code) becomes more and more obscured by the layers of error-handling, cancel-detection, retrying, and so on. I really wish some of this was built into the language, especially cancellation. For example, channels don&#x27;t support contexts. So if you have a loop like this:<p><pre><code>  for evt := range taskCh {\n    handle(evt)\n  }\n<\/code><\/pre>\n...then you have to rewrite it to support cancellation. So you have a few options. One is to select on both the channel and context:<p><pre><code>  for {\n    select {\n      case evt := &lt;-taskCh:\n        handle(evt)\n      case &lt;-ctx.Done():\n        return ctx.Err()\n    }\n  }\n<\/code><\/pre>\nBecause of this, you can no longer use a for loop. Immediately the code got more bloated and less readable.<p>Another option is to spawn a goroutine whose only job is to abort the channel:<p><pre><code>  go func() {\n    &lt;-ctx.Done()\n    close(ch)\n  }()\n  for evt := range taskCh {\n    handle(evt)\n  }\n  return ctx.Err()\n  <\/code><\/pre>\nThat&#x27;s a bit better (and you could move the for loop into its own function for clarify, without changing anything else). But it&#x27;s still worse than a simple for loop!<p>As a real-world example, here [1] is some code I&#x27;ve been working on lately. A controller starts N workers that need to process a task queue. If the controller is stopped, all the workers need to stop. So I use the pattern above. But I can&#x27;t use a for loop! That&#x27;s because I use a task queue abstraction that needs to support features that Go channels don&#x27;t.<p>I can&#x27;t use a for loop or select block to block on the task queue, because only channels support that. So that&#x27;s another problem with Go: Often, you can use raw channels as your data processing primitive if things are simple enough, but in practice, channels are best for coordination, and you have to build your own primitives — and yet, by building those primitives, you lose language expressiveness.<p>To address the concrete example, I&#x27;d love to do this instead:<p><pre><code>  &#x2F;&#x2F; Range over task queue (custom object with blocking\n  &#x2F;&#x2F; semantics), automatically cancel if ctx is cancelled\n  for task := range taskQueue with ctx {\n    handle(task)\n  }\n<\/code><\/pre>\n[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;atombender&#x2F;6bcff2c2d8fec32bc80ce1f57a8e61f6\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;atombender&#x2F;6bcff2c2d8fec32bc80ce1f57...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-09-03 19:58:12"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["fulafel"],"id":[24361367],"kids":[24361792,24361381],"parent":[24359650],"text":["What would a test for this look like, having a lot of processes?"],"time":["2020-09-03 08:37:44"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[24362905],"kids":{},"parent":[24359650],"text":{},"time":["2020-09-03 13:27:55"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":["jacktang"],"id":[24361274],"kids":{},"parent":[24359650],"text":["try erlang!"],"time":["2020-09-03 08:24:20"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["The_rationalist"],"id":[24361453],"kids":{},"parent":[24359650],"text":["But with Kotlin flow it is!"],"time":["2020-09-03 08:56:13"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["apta"],"id":[24367037],"kids":{},"parent":[24359650],"text":["Using goroutines in golang is not dissimilar from threads in other languages (except that you can spawn much more of them), with all the downfalls and gotchas.
