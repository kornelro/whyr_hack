Fifteen years ago (through about 2009, I would say -- about the time Facebook demonstrably took over MySpace), there were tons of services and startups built around blog discovery.<p>And even into the early 2010s, Tumblr was still a thriving community that paid host to many different different subcultures and demographics (whereas today, Tumblr is largely fandom).<p>But now? The spammers helped murder the pingback&#x2F;trackback -- RSS is still alive but it is often hidden and isn&#x27;t even always a default for various static site blogging engines -- not to mention the lengths web browsers go to to deny that RSS even exists -- and the art of finding quality like-minded blogs of any size, is incredibly difficult.<p>Google had a blog search part of its search engine but shut that down nearly a decade ago.

It&#x27;s heavily used in the car industry in Europe, but not widely known in academia.<p>Here are some talks about Modelica: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=-mvEUuc-sWE&amp;t=153\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=-mvEUuc-sWE&amp;t=153<\/a>  and <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=39F___xyI0k\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=39F___xyI0k<\/a><p>Here is a complete course if you want to dig in: \n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;spoken-tutorial.org&#x2F;tutorial-search&#x2F;?search_foss=OpenModelica&amp;search_language=English\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;spoken-tutorial.org&#x2F;tutorial-search&#x2F;?search_foss=Ope...<\/a><p>And if you&#x27;re wondering &quot;Will it emscripten and run in the browser?&quot;, the answer is yes, of course: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshort.github.io&#x2F;mdpad&#x2F;mdpad.html?Modelica.Electrical.Analog.Examples.ChuaCircuit.md\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshort.github.io&#x2F;mdpad&#x2F;mdpad.html?Modelica.Electrical...<\/a><p>Context: I&#x27;m researching a new book on ordinary differential equations through various real-world simulations, so like an ODEs theory book, but actually applying the concepts to real world systems.

For example, when I plonk down a button in the Ionic Framework I get a beautifully engineered and designed button, but it also has 10 CSS classes attached to it that I don&#x27;t really understand. I sometimes feel like the thing I&#x27;ve created isn&#x27;t truly &quot;mine&quot;.<p>That seems to be the nature of CSS utility frameworks. Composition over inheritance; or in this case monolithic element styles. Is the utility function to fetch elements from the DOM tree also truly &quot;yours&quot;? Where&#x27;s the line drawn? I could get the text representation of the DOM tree and write my own parser? How about that?<p>&gt; I therefore decided to go back to the basics and code my own tiny website. I already knew how to go about it, you probably do too, it&#x27;s really easy (if you don&#x27;t know here&#x27;s how). However, I&#x27;d never actually done it, and I&#x27;d not made a website without a framework in over a decade.<p>Ah! And there&#x27;s the problem! Are you creating a website or an application? I do understand that this feels like a cleansing of sorts. But in my opinion doesn&#x27;t reinforce the original argument.<p>I think the more experience you gain as a developer the more often you will come to the realization that technology evolves and also becomes more nuanced over time.

The reason is because I was volunteering at a brewery, and one of the hottest commodities for small breweries is used kegs from bigger breweries that are replacing them.  Most of the major breweries use keg management services and rent the kegs, which is overkill for smaller breweries, so owning kegs is important starting out.<p>Kegs are also sought after for the homebrewers market too; you can save a ton of money buying used, and they become available as people fall out of the hobby.<p>My plan was to either set up a market place or buy and resell kegs for a small profit.  Even a bulletin board that just shows announcements for used keg sales would be helpful.<p>There are a few reasons I haven&#x27;t pursued this.  First, specifically for homebrewers, is gaining momentum from other marketplaces like Facebook, Craigslist, and local homebrew shops.  For commercial kegs, these sales are usually announced word of mouth, and I am not well connected enough to be in the loop, and also, there is really no friction selling these kegs that a website could reduce.  They &quot;fly off the shelves&quot;.  There are other issues too with the frequency these sales happen.<p>My point being, in a long winded way, is that buying a domain name and getting business ideas from it still requires business acumen, networking (which the author does mention), and a innate sense of the problem space and what desire there is for a web based solution.

There were Sprite objects that had an associated Image and a position (among other things). The onUpdate(dt) method of the &quot;screen&quot; didn&#x27;t explicitly draw things on the screen, it only updated positions and other attributes of the Sprites, and the renderer would do the rest (back in the days of software rendering, it updated only dirty sections of the screen, etc).<p>Still, making programmatic animations was difficult, and for videogames you want things to look very nice (smooth movement, easing in and out, transparency effects, that kind of thing). There was a lot of { srcX, srcY, dstX, dstY, time } sets, for every thing that moved.<p>At some point I had an idea similar to what this blog proposes. I called them SpriteControllers, and they could be &quot;attached&quot; to a Sprite. The engine would call each SC&#x27;s onUpdate(dt) method on every frame, and the SC would change the position, rotation, alpha, or tint of the Sprite.<p>By default all the attached SCs would work in parallel, so the next step was to have a SCSequence to run things in series. Also each SC was allowed to declare when it was &quot;done&quot;. Some did (like linear motion from A to B), some never finished (like a pulsating glow).<p>It was a fun development in the sense that it made something that was very difficult to do by hand surprisingly easy, and took our games to the next level in terms of visual quality, just by adding a bunch of very short classes.<p>Making games was fun in a way.

That&#x27;s semantics, but I will add that in my opinion, literate programming is way more effective than declarative programming.<p>Literate programming is just syntactic sugar around functional programming. For example:<p><pre><code>    qux(bar(foo,baz),garlply)\n<\/code><\/pre>\n...becomes:<p><pre><code>    foo.bar(baz).qux(garply)\n<\/code><\/pre>\nThis is the sort of thing that typically emerges when you have immutable objects, and demonstrates a sort of equivalence between immutable OOP and FP. This is why I don&#x27;t generally care about functional programming versus object oriented programming debates: they&#x27;re equivalent if you don&#x27;t mutate. I&#x27;m much more interested in immutability than a slavish loyalty to functions over methods. And I tend to agree with the OP that literate programming is very effective.<p>What people usually mean when they say &quot;declarative programming&quot; is they want to write a config file in, say, JSON, and have that be their program. But that would mean that the implementer of the language would have to think of every possible way that you could possibly want to configure the program, so they start adding customization points where you can write code in an actual language which is called in certain spots. So now you have to know how to program in a normal language, <i>and<\/i> know how all the different customization points work. Oh and while you&#x27;re doing that, you can forget about getting anything helpful like a stack trace, because it was <i>declarative<\/i> so you don&#x27;t need to worry about what is calling what, right? So you get things that just fail silently and you don&#x27;t know why, like:<p><pre><code>    class Mail(models.Model):\n        ordering = &#x27;-received&#x27;\n        sender = models.EmailField()\n        receiver = models.EmailField()\n        received = models.DateTimeField()\n        body = models.TextField()\n<\/code><\/pre>\nThis orders by received ascending, even though you clearly are telling it to order by received descending... have fun figuring out why! I&#x27;m picking on Django here but it&#x27;s actually one of the <i>best<\/i> examples of declarative programming. The problem isn&#x27;t that they didn&#x27;t validate for this case: I don&#x27;t think they could do that reasonably.

When that format is in memory, it can be processed to different degrees to achieve different levels of performance.<p>For example, if looking up &quot;str&quot; is an issue, an interpreter could cache the last function it got for &quot;str&quot; conditional on some invalidation token (e.g. &quot;global_identifier_change_count&quot;), so it doesn&#x27;t in fact need to look it up every time.<p>Boxing can be eliminated by using type-specific representations of the operations, and choosing different code paths depending on checking the actual type. Hoisting those type checks outside of loops is then a big win. Add inlining, and the hoisting logic can see more loops to move things out of. Inlining also gets rid of your argument passing overhead.<p>None of this requires targeting machine code directly, you can optimize interpreter code, and in fact that&#x27;s what the back end of retargetable optimizers looks like - intermediate representation is an interpretable format.<p>Of course things get super-complex super-quickly, but that&#x27;s the trade-off."],"time":["2020-05-19 18:25:09"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["umvi"],"id":[23237876],"kids":[23238023,23238504,23239059,23240813,23238213,23238083],"parent":[23235930],"text":["I&#x27;ve found it often doesn&#x27;t matter how fast or slow python is if the bottleneck is outside of python&#x27;s control.<p>For example, I wrote an lcov alternative in python called fastcov[0].

So here we have the opposite of the situation in this article: new US dollar banknotes are worth more than old USD banknotes (this is not an isolated case, a quick web search shows that often old US dollar bank notes aren&#x27;t even accepted for exchange)."],"time":["2020-05-19 21:46:28"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["reidacdc"],"id":[23243037],"kids":[23244707,23258008],"parent":[23237044],"text":["There are fungibility surprises in the west, also.<p>In the UK, one sometimes runs across banknotes issued by banks in Scotland, which generally circulate like those issued by the Bank of England, but have some technical differences.<p>Many years ago, I had a cab driver in London who very adamantly refused to take a Scottish pound note by way of fare payment, and as I later learned, was well within his rights to do so.<p>It&#x27;s sort of the inverse of the situation described in the article -- Scottish and Bank of England notes are technically not fungible, but are mostly treated as if they are, with a few exceptions, whereas the article describes notes that technically are fungible, but are treated as if they are not."],"time":["2020-05-20 05:33:09"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["redis_mlc"],"id":[23242330],"kids":[23243595],"parent":[23237044],"text":["Some currency factoids:<p>1) North Korea has nearly perfect USD$100 printing plates, and finances imports with them.

We tested an alternative strategy in which shapes were traced on the surface of visual cortex by stimulating electrodes in dynamic sequence. In both sighted and blind participants, dynamic stimulation enabled accurate recognition of letter shapes predicted by the brain’s spatial map of the visual world. Forms were presented and recognized rapidly by blind participants, up to 86 forms per minute. These findings demonstrate that a brain prosthetic can produce coherent percepts of visual forms."],"time":["2020-05-19 13:28:33"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["unexaminedlife"],"id":[23231376],"kids":[23231558],"parent":[23211471],"text":["This ted talk still has my mind blown.

But other modern languages have this separation as well, and it is cleaner.<p>Consider for example a common Java exam question, should you use interface or abstract class? This is a completely artificial problem that doesn&#x27;t occur in languages that separate these abstractions orthogonally. Also another common exam question, access control (private, public, protected) is more complicated due to lack of the separation of encapsulation and inheritance principles.<p>Another example is Java is arguably much less readable than it could be because organizing all the code as classes makes code more difficult to follow (especially without IDE it&#x27;s insanity of directories) - you don&#x27;t know which classes are just utility types or simple functions and which actually contain the meat of the code.

Unfailingly polite. Gracious with the money. Helps out those less fortunate as much as is possible under the constraints of doing what it takes to be great. An inspiration and a role model. By definition, by any sensible definition of the term, if you knew this person well you would agree they are as far from an asshole as it is possible to be.<p>There is a non-zero set of people in this person&#x27;s life who will necessarily decide this person is an asshole anyhow. In the early days, you invite this person to social events, and they decline because they&#x27;re practicing. Maybe someone&#x27;s even crushing on this person and consistently asks them out and consistently gets declined. However polite they are in declining, there&#x27;s one person who is going to decide they&#x27;re an asshole. Whoever it is in second place on the team, who under normal circumstances would talented enough to be the star player on the team but is getting shown up by the fact they&#x27;re on a team with Michael freakin&#x27; Jordan... they&#x27;re likely to harbor opinions of assholery, because if we humans are good at anything, it&#x27;s rationalizing our pre-existing beliefs and finding reasons why we&#x27;re right.<p>When professional and financial success is obtained in later years, people who want a piece of it but are denied will decide this person is an asshole. A coach who tries to control this person to take credit for their fame but is rebuffed because what the coach is saying to do is not what it takes to be great will decide this guy is an asshole.

Someone who is malleable enough to both know and to react to the different needs of different people on their team,&quot; I&#x27;d posit it&#x27;s pretty clear he&#x27;s talking his own book.<p>I do not know the author, and taking shots at him on an internet forum is small, but as a general principle, Jeffery Pfeffer talks about this retroactive continuity of virtue in success stories in his books. Everyone wants to think their luck made them good. Riding growth up to the top is a different set of skills than setting off the chain reaction that creates the energy behind it. In fact, malleability is precisely what you need to ride growth, but I&#x27;d argue you need a force of will to be the one to create it. That carries asshole-risk.<p>The stories successful people tell about how they became successful are almost exclusively about how virtuous they were, and how their path was noble. A critical view of success and its factors is very much the &quot;loser&#x27;s&quot; view, as telling it from outside means you don&#x27;t have it, but it still has some value because the one told from inside is not the one that will get you there. They aren&#x27;t in the business of building (ungated) ladders behind them. The story successful people don&#x27;t tell is the one where they leveraged someones trust, scandalizing, discrediting, and isolating someone who lacked their mendacity, or put people who trusted them at more personal risk than they may have perceived.<p>Nobody likes an asshole, and it&#x27;s a good thing to build things that select against them, but the definition has to be better than what the losers just call the person they lose to, or as a foil for back-fitting a story of skill and virtue onto some really grisly work and luck.<p>It&#x27;s like Ray Dalio saying he&#x27;s a billionaire because of transcendental meditation.

And it will also be a lesson (for the proponents of some change to any kind of standard) about why just a technically better solution doesn&#x27;t always win.<p>Because, if you look at almost any standard, there&#x27;s generally nothing stopping someone from proposing an alternative or better version.  It&#x27;s the adoption that&#x27;s the tough part.<p>The more fundamental root cause of why this particular &quot;bad&quot; or outdated standard persists so long is that airlines are a very risk averse and capital intensive business.   Any change -- especially one so fundamental as could interfere with their minute-by-minute booking engine (companies can lose billions if that system goes down) -- is highly risky.  And it wasn&#x27;t really built with incremental changeability or &quot;hot swappability&quot; in mind.  Changing it involves retraining thousands of people, changing computer terminals, keyboards (with special character keys coded in plastic), practices, interfaces to yet other vendors.  And when your company is burning dozens of millions of $ per day, that&#x27;s something that you don&#x27;t risk unless it&#x27;s a strategic decision.<p>So that dynamic flows down into what your software vendors are incentivized (or become attuned) to produce or charge you for.   Until there&#x27;s some ground-level shift -- for example suddenly everyone needs to charge baggage fees -- no airline was actively asking for that capability to add on ancillary fees. And no GDS provider was seeking to innovate on it.  Airlines simply wouldn&#x27;t pay the extra for that unnecessary functionality... until they did.<p>Old, expensive, risky industry -- and that&#x27;s why sometimes the change has to come from new entrants who aren&#x27;t tied to these legacy systems.

Mozilla, Google, Microsoft, and Apple could cement themselves as the &quot;only viable browsers&quot; by solving this.  Here is how I see it:<p>- Form a consortium (just like the competing banks did in the 50s to create Visa).<p>- Google, Apple, and Microsoft already have expertise in collecting payments and running services, which they can lend to the consortium.<p>- Each member creates a UI in their own browser for micropayments that is backed by the consortium.<p>- The UI has the ability to add funds (processed by the consortium) and set budgets and have little check boxes for &quot;ask me every time&quot; or &quot;automatically pay if below 1 cent&quot; or &quot;allow up to $5 &#x2F; mo on this web page&quot; or lots of other budget options so that you don&#x27;t have to think about it every time.<p>- When you go to a page, they can throw up a request for payment (which if you&#x27;ve already made a budget decision you don&#x27;t even see as a user), you send a token, they pass the token to the consortium who moves the money from your account to theirs.<p>- The consortium pays out to web pages when they have earned more than $10 (just like Adwords!) and generates a 1099 or equivalent.  They take a piece of pie at this point.<p>And now if you want an ad free experience, or want to use a site that requires micropayments, you must use one of those browsers.  And the site owners can offer both.  Send back a payment request, if it fails, show ads.<p>Heck, even if Google didn&#x27;t want in, Apple, Mozilla, and Microsoft could pull it off without them (they still have about 38% of the market).<p>You can secure it using standard crypto.  The browser generates a private&#x2F;public key pair.  The website generates a keypair.  Both sends the public key to the consortium.  When you make a payment, you generate a message that says &quot;I pay foo.com 1 cent&quot; and then sign it.  Foo.com takes the message, wraps it up and says, &quot;I want 1 cent&quot; and signs it.  The consortium verifies the signatures, makes sure the amounts add up, and then sends back an &quot;OK&quot; response if the user has the funds available.<p>They key here is that if those four agree on a UI and agree to a central payment processor, they have enough pull that website owners will want to use the service.  Especially if there are no per transaction fees.<p>This also solves the onboarding problem for website owners.  It pushes it to the consortium.  Who can push it right into their parent companies.  Google could automatically tie payment to your Google account, and so could Apple and Microsoft.  It would be part of the UI.<p>In fact it would be a good workaround for Google in the new &quot;do not track me&quot; world.<p>People block ads because they are annoying, and trackers because they get no perceived benefit.<p>But payments provide benefit to the user, so they would be more willing to make the payment, thus providing tracking data.

This drives down the employment requirements and removes the older, more level-headed officers.<p>In the past they required a college degree; now it&#x27;s just a high school diploma or GED.  In the past they provided plenty of training (ie. time on the range; de-escalation procedures, etc.); now you get 12 bullets twice a year for certification.  In the past you received a good pension and great insurance; now if you die on the job your family gets nothing.<p>Who in the world would WANT to be a police officer in this situation!?  You get little pay, little respect, and you have to run into the problem while everyone else runs away.<p>This is in no way an excuse for what happened in my town (Louisville, KY) but I thought it might shed some light as to why it happened.  I don&#x27;t think cops are bad people and it only takes a few to really drag them all down.  They are generally just people trying to go to work and make a living.  The vast, vast majority of police officers don&#x27;t wake up wanting to end someone&#x27;s life.  They just want to make their town a bit safer and stay alive to spend time with their families."],"time":["2020-05-19 09:08:30"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["54351623"],"id":[23231712],"kids":{},"parent":[23231186],"text":["I appreciate Mr. Paul&#x27;s sentiment and agree with him.

A mainframe is awesome for certain classes of problems, but I don&#x27;t generally think of those classes as modern.

Sure, maybe it can handle 12 million web requests per second - I&#x27;m skeptical about the complexity of those requests but let&#x27;s roll with it - but now the computing resource is more robust than the network connections you have plugged into it. Are the pipes into your data center truly more reliable than a multi-AZ, multi-region AWS deployment?<p>To put it bluntly, mainframes are wonderful solutions to problems that I don&#x27;t personally find interesting. (Note: personally. It&#x27;s not like I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a legitimate need for the financial systems that mainframes power, it&#x27;s just that I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;m not the one who has to run them.)

IBM knows it, these Enterprise System Media guys know it (whoever they are), and most importantly, every one of these big fortune 500 companies stuck with COBOL apps know it. How many new projects are started each year that target mainframes? Or, alternatively, how many companies who don&#x27;t have any mainframes are thinking about purchasing some for their new service? I&#x27;m guessing close to zero, or maybe even actually zero.<p>The insane premium (in cost, in difficulty to learn, in everything) that you&#x27;re paying for those bazillion 9s of reliability aren&#x27;t worth it. Anyone who actually needs that kind of reliability has the technical knowledge to make it themselves using x86_64. According to his talking points, big tech should be loving mainframes and exclusively use them. But in fact, it&#x27;s the opposite. The most savvy and powerful tech companies use commodity x86_64 while the not so savvy are stuck with their 1980s mainframes. In Emmanual Derman&#x27;s &quot;My Life as a Quant&quot;, he talks about developing a new bond analytics platform at Goldman Sachs. His team decided to build it on Unix (though Genera was floated around as an idea as well), because it was the modern choice and mainframes were legacy. And this was in the early 80s!<p>This article is so unenthusiastic, it&#x27;s kind of sad. It&#x27;s like the author knows what he&#x27;s saying is total bullshit. I predict that in the next 10 years, IBM is going to stop selling hardware (I&#x27;m not even sure why they haven&#x27;t already, but then again, the company isn&#x27;t exactly a paragon of good management) and just release some virtualization package that can run all the legacy crap on x86_64. Or maybe this has already happened, finding any information on what IBM an product <i>actually does<\/i> is quite difficult. I get the impression that no one actually calls IBM to inquire about a product. Instead, I&#x27;m sure some middle management guy sells out his company for a $60 steak and some wine."],"time":["2020-05-20 10:37:04"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["timwaagh"],"id":[23241194],"kids":[23244414,23241825],"parent":[23240559],"text":["I would say developing for java that ultimately will run on mainframe is worse than developing for java for another platform (because deploying to your development websphere is slow and not so reliable). The other problem is that Java is the most &#x27;modern&#x27; programming language available. Nobody wants to write a web app in COBOL or C. But Java isn&#x27;t that good at it either (even without websphere, java does not deploy as fast as python, ruby, php, go). The only misconception is that its 20 years out of date instead of 50.

Uninstall is too often a myth, and the majority of programs out there leave bits and pieces behind.  These add up over time to bloat your registry, disk, kernel drivers, etc, degrading the performance and reliability of your computer.  Multiple conventions for where things go makes it difficult to track down the bits.  (Program Files?  (x86)?  AppData\\[Local|LocalLow|Roaming]?  SteamApps\\common?   ProgramData?  System32&#x2F;SysWOW64?  Dozens of registry locations?)<p>So many installers require unfettered, administrative access to my computer with little indication of exactly what they intend to do (Litter my desktop with new shortcuts?  Add shell hooks?  Install a rootkit?) and no opportunity from the OS to consent your partial permission or retroactively examine the changes.  (Don&#x27;t miss that popup balloon about a new driver!  Have fun parsing through all the noise in your event logs).<p>Even simple chores like managing file type associations became more painful somewhere along the way.<p>There&#x27;s a reason professionals so often fall back to advising a reformat.  Makes me miss the days when your program went someplace like C:\\PHOTOSHOP and most everything for it was contained within.<p>It&#x27;s easy to point fingers at individual software publishers (I&#x27;ve called out some incompetent ones) but mostly I blame Microsoft for failing to evangelize rigorously thought-through best practices and provide better tooling to make it dead easy for developers to get it right.  I might be wrong about this, but the preview looks like a gimmick for finding and running installers.  I would have liked to see improved methodologies, packaging tools, and end-user empowerment announced alongside it.<p>Hats off to folks like Nir Sofer and Mark Russinovich who&#x27;ve shown the world just how much you can pack into a small, single-file, zero-installation EXE that just runs when you click it.<p>I&#x27;ve been using the same computer for 10 years now (with upgrades to components like video, RAID controller, SSD&#x27;s) and have over 700 programs installed on it.  I use third party monitoring software [1] to capture a disk and registry snapshot before and after any installation (and often on updates).  The machine is still nearly as snappy as the day it was built (yes, I benchmark!), but it&#x27;s taken a LOT of ongoing work to keep it that way.  I use other tricks, like locking down certain registry keys and folder locations which programs like to pollute (or where that causes breakage, using startup scripts to clean them out after the fact in a cat and mouse game).  One big win was completely giving up on My Documents.  I treat it like just another AppData, and organize the content I really care about elsewhere.<p>All that said, I really like that my Windows software still comes directly from the vendors.  I&#x27;m not sure how I feel about distribution becoming more centralized under Microsoft&#x27;s control.  Part of me hopes to see a vibrant ecosystem of third-party repos emerge, while another part dreads the confusion about where to get a package that may entail.<p>I do have to give Microsoft credit for enabling third party tools to take care of some of the shortfalls they haven&#x27;t.  On more locked down platforms that&#x27;s been more difficult.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.martau.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.martau.com&#x2F;<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-19 20:46:59"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["tjoff"],"id":[23237889],"kids":{},"parent":[23236218],"text":["Do you need a microsoft&#x2F;whatever account for this?

Common Lisp is used to build what is currently the best free optimizing compiler for quantum computing [1, 2] as well as one of the most flexible quantum computer simulators [3]. They’re both open source, so you can actually see for yourself how we version, deploy as binaries, and deploy in Docker containers.<p>&gt; If you are using lisp in production for non-trivial cases, do these issues still exist?<p>Before getting into the specifics, any large, non-trivial product that customers use will need tweaking. Especially languages that have runtimes, including languages like C. This is usually a result of leaky abstractions that just have to be dealt with in The Real World (TM).<p>&gt; * poor ecosystem of libraries - few gems, most other half-baked<p>You have libraries for most things you need. Some are lacking, like in scientific computing. But all your usual stuff to glue things together is there and works.<p>Some people confuse “half-baked” with “no commits for 5 years”. Lisp libraries are older than many in vogue languages, and Lisp doesn’t change, so “5 years no commits” shouldn’t be worrisome.<p>At Rigetti, the biggest weight we had to pull that we wouldn’t have needed to do in, say, Python, is bind to a bunch of FORTRAN code, specifically LAPACK. That was a pain because you need to do FFI with complex double floats.<p>* poor community coordination<p>The community all agrees on one thing: Lisp is standardized.<p>Lisp lacks a sort of “centralized community” like Go or Clojure. I like to think that Common Lisp is more “democratic”. We have a “constitution” (the Common Lisp standard) that we all agree on and we all make our own contributions atop that.<p>With that said, #lisp on Freenode is attentive. SBCL, for example, responds to bug reports almost immediately. Several library ecosystems are kept up to date, etc.<p>&gt; * Dependency management limitations with quicklisp<p>With Quicklisp, I personally realized a lot of other dependency management solutions are overblown and don’t actually solve problems. Maybe QL gets away with it because the ecosystem is smaller than others.<p>Xach, the creator of QL, does a lot of community diligence for free to ensure things work.<p>For production code, I’ve had 0 issues.<p>&gt; * poor support for json<p>We use YASON [4] and it works fine.<p>&gt; * poor support for async<p>This is true now but wasn’t true years ago. Lisp implementers have not been interested in implementing a runtime supporting async programming. Little in the Common Lisp language itself prohibits it. Before the world of threads and SMP, Lisp implementers <i>did<\/i> implement async runtimes.<p>Why aren’t Lisp implementers interested in async? I’m not sure. Maybe they see it as a passing fad?<p>&gt; * have to restart the server every 20 days because of some memory leak<p>Memory leaks can happen but they’re usually the programmer’s fault for not understanding symbol interning, weak pointers, or finalizers. Writing long-running applications does require know-how.<p>&gt; * hack to tune GC<p>I don’t consider it hacking. In SBCL we tune the GC to our application. This seems reasonable; different programs have different allocation patterns. But you wouldn’t need to do this out of the box.<p>&gt; is there a way you can quantify effort is resolving them, and if yes, what is it?<p>Big applications that are customer products require care and feeding. The benefits of writing in Lisp in the first place largely outweigh some of the extra work needed to productionize it.<p>I will say that writing production Common Lisp code is greatly benefited by having at least one experienced Lisper on the team. If a team would, for some reason, write an application in Lisp but not really have a good understanding of the language, then productionizing and hardening will be difficult.<p>&gt; and, finally, if you had to re-do your project, would you chose lisp or something else?<p>Common Lisp allows something that never existed before (a completely automatic, optimizing quantum compiler) to exist. If Lisp weren’t there, that wouldn’t exist.<p>My parting advice is this: The biggest difficulty in writing an application is to actually write it. It takes a lot of hard work to get requirements, listen to feedback, articulate a direction, etc. In Common Lisp, SBCL or LispWorks or whatever else, dumping an executable is so easy and you can have a deployable “production app” in 5 minutes. So the good news is that you won’t be held up trying to figure out how to dockerize your Python app.<p>I definitely agree that before embarking, doing an objective and relevant comparative analysis would be good (we did this at Rigetti), but ultimately you just need to sit down and write.<p>Almost every programming problem is solvable these days with enough glue and elbow grease.

What you gain with your &quot;superficial&quot; simplicity, you pay a hundred times over with the algorithmic complexity of having to use threads with shared state. Every time you&#x27;re troubleshooting some weird race condition that you can&#x27;t easily reproduce you&#x27;ll be wishing you had just used futures.<p>What I do is that the bulk of my processing runs in the main thread and I occasionally dispatch work to other threads, making sure that no mutable state is shared. When the &quot;async&quot; work is finished, I just have the background threads communicate the results to the main thread by setting a future (i.e., scheduling in the main thread the execution of the future&#x27;s consumer on the results). Async IO operations are modeled just the same. In the beginning I had used callbacks spaghetti (mostly writing things in continuation passing style), but I started trying futures and found them <i>much<\/i> nicer.<p>I&#x27;ll admit that on the surface this makes my code look slightly uglier than if it was directly sync code; however, it allows me to very safely use multiple threads. I think not having to make my classes thread safe (I typically stop at making them thread-compatible) and not having to troubleshoot difficult race conditions (and not having to block on IO or being able to easily run background operations) has been a huge win. If I had to rewrite this from scratch, I&#x27;d likely choose this model again. My editor only needs to use mutexes and such in very very few places; it suffices to make my classes thread-compatible and to ensure that all work in threads other than the main thread happens on const objects (and that such objects don&#x27;t get deallocated before the background threads are done using them).<p>I rolled out my own implementation of futures here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;alefore&#x2F;edge&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;src&#x2F;futures&#x2F;futures.h\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;alefore&#x2F;edge&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;src&#x2F;futures&#x2F;futu...<\/a> (One notable characteristic is that it only allows a single listener, which I found worked well with &quot;move&quot; semantics for supporting non-copyable types that the listener gets ownership of.)<p>Here is one example of where it is used: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;alefore&#x2F;edge&#x2F;blob&#x2F;5cb6f67e1e0726f8fbe12db3d1e0cd12b07d5135&#x2F;src&#x2F;buffer.cc#L919\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;alefore&#x2F;edge&#x2F;blob&#x2F;5cb6f67e1e0726f8fbe12db...<\/a><p>In this example, it implements the operation of reloading a buffer, which is somewhat complex in that it requires several potentially long running or async operations (such as the evaluation of several &quot;buffer-reload.cc&quot; programs, opening the file, opening a log for the file, notifying listeners for reload operations...). It may seem uglier than if it was all in sync code, but then I would have to either block the main thread (unacceptable in this context) or make all my classes thread safe (which I think would be significantly more complexity).<p>I think this is cleaner than callbacks spaghetti because the code still reflects somewhat closely its logical structure.
