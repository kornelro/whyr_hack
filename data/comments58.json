Their 1080p video quality is god-awful compared to Amazon. They may even have made it worse: from the &quot;ladder&quot; comparisons, it looks like they jump to higher resolutions at lower average bitrates now, so if you&#x27;re stuck at 1080p you&#x27;re going to be getting worse quality after these changes than before.<p>Also, something that&#x27;s kind of weird about all this is that encoders (x264, x265, etc) already have their own rate control algorithms that decide on a frame or scene basis how many bits to use. Netflix taking an approach like this is equivalent to claiming that they&#x27;re capable of doing a better job than these codecs in an automated way - so why not just contribute the code needed to achieve these improvements back to the projects they&#x27;re using?<p>Last, it&#x27;s very weird to select individual frames from an encode and not a selection of frames. The comparisons purport to show that the lower bitrate encode is better than the higher bitrate encode, but in fact (if I understand how they&#x27;re using rate control correctly) what they are showing is <i>a single frame<\/i> in the lower bitrate encode that uses <i>more bits<\/i> than the same frame in the higher bitrate encode. So it&#x27;s arguably not a fair comparison. And even with that, depending on how sensitive you are to artifacts, some of the &quot;optimized ladder&quot; encodes still look worse.<p>Edit: here is an example of what I mean when I said that they may have made the quality at 1080p worse. If what you end up watching is the highest bitrate 1080p available, you would get higher quality on the old latter than on the newer one. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;rzPR7Sh.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;rzPR7Sh.jpg<\/a> Actually, on some of the examples, even 720p on the older ladder is better than 1080p on the newer one!"],"time":["2020-08-29 02:25:51"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["radley"],"id":[24311173],"kids":[24311353,24311258,24311483,24311699,24311265,24312529,24314768,24321691],"parent":[24310104],"text":["&gt; Sometimes we ingest a title that would need more bits at the highest end of the quality spectrum — even higher than the 16 Mbps limit of the fixed-bitrate ladder.<p>From just a cursory inspection using my Apple TV 4K, 12 Mbps is their target bitrate but their ceiling was ~16 Mbps.<p>That&#x27;s still only a third of what AppleTV+ offers (36&#x2F;48) and only 2&#x2F;3 of Disney+ (18&#x2F;24).

After correcting for that mistake it cut the monthly cost for tuition+insurance for my local school in half.  In addition, some schools offer insurance for spouses and children as well, which usually drives the cost per person down even further.

Distributing extensions this way was free. While never a huge platform due to Mac Safari&#x27;s relatively low market share, it had a number of fairly decent extensions.<p>* In OS X El Capitan Apple rolled their extensions signing program into the Apple developer program, which costs $100&#x2F;year. Extensions that were not signed would be &quot;untrusted&quot; and would be quite annoying to install. Many extension developers openly criticized the move–some refused to continue supporting Safari.<p>* Almost simultaneously, Apple introduced their content blocking API, where extensions could declare a list of what are essentially regular expressions to block content. This model is quite similar to Chrome&#x27;s declarativeWebRequest API in that extensions have little flexibility at runtime to vet requests. This API works in Safari on macOS as well as 64-bit iOS devices.<p>* With Safari 12 Apple deprecated the old web extensions model (no longer loading these) and introduced a new extensions model, App Extensions. These are native bundles that run out-of-process and communicate with JavaScript that you can inject into the page. Again, these bundles must be signed with a (paid) developer ID certificate and be sandboxed. Distribution via the App Store is recommended but not required. Any remaining extensions that share code across browsers (i.e. not using native code) are now locked out of the platform.<p>* (This announcement, which is a rehash of the one at WWDC from this June) In Safari 14 Apple is supporting a conversion tool that converts your standard WebExtension into something that Safari can load, with the same signing and distribution restrictions as app extensions (costs money, sandbox). Many simple APIs are available, but there is the notable absence of the ability to block requests–so uBlock cannot be ported, for example. NoScript does not seem possible to implement either.<p>* Safari on iOS has never supported extensions–this hasn&#x27;t changed. The only extensibility available there is still just content blockers using declarative lists."],"time":["2020-08-28 05:37:24"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["fancy_pantser"],"id":[24301352],"kids":[24304988,24302739,24302799],"parent":[24300548],"text":["This is really exciting for me!

Chrome is already nuking the current state of things by introducing sweeping changes in Manifest V3. The one that caught the mainstream was webRequests and breaking content blockers. What&#x27;s not talked about is how moving the &quot;background&quot; process from a long lived hidden web page to a short lived, event based service worker, breaks the actually useful cases of extensions.<p>For our RSS extension it breaks a bunch of things, like polling for updates in feeds, removes any sort of complex persistent storage like IndexedDB, the ability to open a websocket connection for a realtime connection to backend infrastructure (if the user chooses to use our cloud syncing).<p>Now Chrome has also made a sweeping change by hiding all extensions you install by default. Hiding away the main interface element of the extension. This breaks the &quot;unread&quot; count or the point of the browser action. How many users will actually understand that they need to &quot;pin&quot; extensions to the toolbar? How many extensions will you have installed that you forgot to remove?<p>It&#x27;s like the 90s again. All other browsers have moved to Chrome&#x27;s extension system, which by no means is a standard. Firefox has explicitly said they will support content blockers in their current form, but not their stance on Manifest V3. Safari has disabled a large portion of the API&#x27;s, and being just released, what&#x27;s their story for MV3? Since there is no standard there is no work to keep the API&#x27;s in sync.

Eventually I learned some of those languages and went lived in some those countries. HAM radio opened the world to me. I just got my General license in June and with SDR radio and my computer started listening in on HAMs. I was shocked at the language and topics and conversations. Way different than 60 years. Started shopping for a kit traceiver to build, hard to find one, not like the old Heathkit days, when I built my first radio when I was 8 years old. It made me sad, then I started realizing that the nerdy kids like me were into 3d printing and Arduino and robots. However, they are going to miss out on the IoT, which will be driven by radios. The young kids are going miss learning the electronics and radio skills I got to learn before I was ten. Those skills took me into computers, programming and physics eventually. I am experimenting now with open source SDR and Lora mesh radio. Still alot to learn. If we really want our country to these type of skill taught early enough to open kids minds to what is possible and that they can design and build it.

As @nicoburns points out in another comment, there are many companies that can do the job (MSFT, Google, Cisco, etc. have perfectly comparable alternatives here), and if you&#x27;re willing to look outside of the biggest companies explicitly targeting business meetings, you have other companies with working technical infrastructure targeted at a different market (i.e. FB, Appl) and a batch-ful of YC startups trying to provide the same functionality to the same market.<p>What I think the article is pointing out is that when Zoom goes down, schools can&#x27;t teach. And that&#x27;s true. I think this is indicative of a usability &#x2F; coordination &#x2F; culture problem of missing fallbacks. For example, when Zoom goes down a teacher (at least to my knowledge) can&#x27;t&#x2F;won&#x27;t quickly email out a &quot;Hey class, Zoom is down so here is the Google meet link for today&quot;.<p>However, this is true of many technologies (if gmail is down I&#x27;m not getting email, if slack is down I&#x27;m not reading messages, and if Github is down I&#x27;m not pushing code). I think the larger problem is HOW MANY institutions it&#x27;s a critical point of failure for. If Zoom goes down, our courts largely pause, our education largely pauses, our economy largely pauses, etc. The same is not true of Github or Gmail. In this regard it&#x27;s closer to a powergrid failure.<p>This should go away as verticalized solutions and fallbacks appear (leading to broader diversity, where not all courts use the same platform), but I think the key things to think about until then are:<p>1. Is there anything Zoom could do to create stronger network effects (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ayushsood.com&#x2F;zooms-missing-platform&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ayushsood.com&#x2F;zooms-missing-platform&#x2F;<\/a>) preventing new entrants from entering the market?\n2. If they did those things, how could we respond to ensure Zoom&#x27;s incumbent position didn&#x27;t allow them to prevent new entrants? An old-internet answer would be to centralize the key nodes, effectively utilitize them, and then allow anyone to make a platform that connects to them (i.e. AT&amp;T doesn&#x27;t own telephony, DNS&#x27; don&#x27;t own the internet, Gmail doesn&#x27;t own email).<p>I&#x27;m not sure how likely this is given (1) we&#x27;re moving towards centralization generally (2) the importance of performance in video streaming. Any abstraction creates overhead, and that might be a critical failure to open standards in the video streaming space."],"time":["2020-08-28 19:24:11"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["k__"],"id":[24307060],"kids":[24307279,24307448,24313494,24307088],"parent":[24306833],"text":["Is it?<p>I used like 5 different services in the last 7 months and all worked reasonably well."],"time":["2020-08-28 18:49:43"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["esaym"],"id":[24307384],"kids":[24307436,24308065],"parent":[24306833],"text":["Not sure why there isn&#x27;t more open source alternatives in this realm.

Countries like China, the US, Australia, and the UK are of course interested in controlling the flow of information for political, ideological, military and other reasons. Therefore they are interested in controlling what the IETF does and how. That&#x27;s the nature of any big country or entity (including companies). E.g. Apple kicking competitors out of the app store is exactly the same kind of behavior. Whether that&#x27;s good or bad is a separate discussion.<p>The reason the internet exists at all is that it provided a way around &#x2F; relief from this level of control and that it allowed independent innovation to happen. In a way this was a happy accident because a lot of the funding for the R&amp;D behind this came out of cold war era defense projects which were very much not about the free flow of information. So, it would be a stretch that this is working as intended. But it was successful exactly because of that and the IETF brought together the right parties to ensure it kept enabling this.<p>More strict networks ultimately failed to compete because users and companies found that they needed to tap into this free flow of information. The fact that countries like China, Russia, North Korea, etc. are on the internet at all (grudgingly and with all the restrictions that they try to enforce) is because they need to be. They are also part of the world economy for the same reason. And as much as they&#x27;d like to tell others what the value of their own currencies should be relative to $, renminbi, euro, etc.; they have no choice but to leave that to market forces. Of course it doesn&#x27;t stop them from trying to influence and manipulate that. Nor does it stop anyone else from doing so. But ultimately it leads to either hyper inflation or people just swallowing their pride and accepting or paying in dollars for stuff they buy (e.g. oil) or sell on the international market. The internet is the same; it&#x27;s a take it or leave it kind of thing. Either you are on it or you are not.<p>It is a bit of neutral ground where mutually hostile entities looking to control, monitor, and manipulate each other can conduct their business (some of it very bad business). It works precisely because things like https prevent man in the middle attacks, certificates keep us honest (to some extent). All the other technical tooling the IETF standardized to ensure third parties don&#x27;t mess with private interactions between two parties trying to have some meaningful interaction is there for just that reason. Of course the tools are far from perfect and there&#x27;s an arms race between intelligence agencies to exploit loop holes, bugs, design flaws, etc. The IETF&#x27;s role is to address these issues, not to create more of them to enable authoritarian regimes to gain an edge over other nations or their own citizens.<p>So, DNS over HTTPS is a good thing and exactly the right thing for the IETF to be standardizing because it fixes a problem with what they previously standardized (i.e. DNS). It&#x27;s controversial because it takes away power from countries actively abusing that power. But the fact that others are exploiting protocol weaknesses in DNS is fundamentally a bug and not a feature. You could argue DNS over HTTPS is not a perfect solution or that better solutions exist but not that the role of the IETF is to enable the Chinese to have a say in what people (in or outside China) lookup via DNS. That&#x27;s not their role. If the Chinese, the Australians, etc. want to block people that choose to configure their browsers to use this (or browsers that do this by default), that is of course their good right.

I have personally implanted many animals of different species with similar apparatus as the ones described by neuralink, and published numerous papers in the field, including theoretical papers on neural activity coding and modeling. Here are my two cents about this. Sorry if it’s long, I m hoping that this will help provide perspective on the topic at hand.<p>As a scientist, the first thing that is striking is that this is another example of science by press conference. It’s probably why there is a lot of eye rolling in the field. No data has been released (including in the single author elon musk paper published a couple of years ago), and it is therefore impossible to judge the results independently, let alone have a scientific discussion about it.<p>First off, it should be noted that not much here is completely new. Chronic implantation of multielectrode arrays, with wireless recordings have been around for roughly 15 years. These arrays are able to record and stimulate. This is usually done in mice, in which space is even more limited than the pig. The number of contacts (i.e recording points) of 1000 is also on par with the current state of the art (see, e.g the neuropixel implants). The fact that neuralink managed to reproduce this seemingly from scratch is an impressive feat, but in no way is it novel. Dozens of labs around the world do this every day.<p>The issues with electrode recordings are to get close enough to each cell without damanging anything. If the contact is too far, the recording is polluted by other neurons, and one has to rely on blind signal separation to make out each cell. As a result in typical experiments, each electrode is manually positioned In the close vicinity of the neuron (think micrometers). This is a challenge with large arrays because each contact is not independant which reduces the yield. This likely happens here.<p>Another important problem arises with chronic implantantion. When you insert something in the brain, make it as thin as you wish the brain will not like it. There is going to be pushing and shoving of cells, and when the brain reset in position (within minutes) it will have moved. This requires fine tuning of each electrode’s position to keep it close to the neurons. More importantly, it will create a scar. Cells will die around it, the organism will try and isolate the foreign object. This takes weeks. This is the reason why, roughly speaking, no single cell has been recorded from for more than weeks (the record i believe is around 3 months): after a while the electrode is simply too isolated from the actual neurons to pick up a signal. There are endeavors around this, With other electrode materials, etc but neuralink does not do that. (Another really cool way to do chronic implant is with calcium imaging with small implanted confocal microscopes)<p>In addition, this is likely bad for the organism, and possibly not something you would want happen in your brain. BTW I believe that (in addition to size constraints) this is why they are doing studies on pigs now (although their neural activity is not well documented as opposed to mice&#x2F;rats or primates): it is commonly used as a model for human injuries.<p>Finally, do be aware that some humans are already implanted chronically in the brain with electrodes:\n- For parkinsons, in a specific, non cortical area. These electrodes can record and stimulate to alleviate crises\n- For hearing, it’s not stricto sensu in the brain (in the cochlear cavities) but it stimulates neurons\n- On the surface of the brain, with ecog electrodes mostly used during surgery but sometimes chronically for epilepsy diagnosis<p>In addition to these technical issues (which are serious enough, by the way), the claims made here are just sort of outlandish. Even in very well controlled laboratory conditions, there is very little evidence that it is remotely possible to “record” memories (let alone replay them). For the most part it is because we have _strictly no idea_ how _anything is encoded_ in the brain (there is even raging debate as to whether it “encodes” anything). (Sorry to my neuroscientist friends and colleagues, but we are not close to anything the layperson would qualify as “understanding what the brain does”, by a long stretch.) In addition, some of the less outlandish claims (e.g. controlling robotic limbs, etc) made by neuralink are things on which neuroscientists have been working on for decades. It’s not impossible for sure (as many of us argue in their grant proposals), but it is hard. And the plan presented by neuralink (more electrodes) is in no way innovative to an insider in the field. In fact, I doubt that it would get NIH funding.<p>TLDR there are many well documented issues with this endeavor that many people have been working on for decades. It’s frustrating that the general public be exposed to the uninteresting sugar coated sci fi version of an otherwise complex, nuanced and thus interesting field of science."],"time":["2020-08-29 15:30:10"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["throwawayneural"],"id":[24312167],"kids":[24312251,24312185,24313192],"parent":[24311152],"text":["(throwaway.)<p>I&#x27;ve been deeply interested in this field for a long time and BCIs specifically.

But Visa&#x27;s number for transactions is generally <i>not<\/i> the transaction number you get from your payment processor.

Every application is manually reviewed, so, uh, give me a few days.<p>Regarding &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; users; this question has been at the center of tilde.town since its inception. We&#x27;re a community first and a technological project second and encouraging a sense of belonging for users is our primary goal.<p>Certain users sign up to abuse resources; that&#x27;s easy to catch and deal with. Other users want to import the wider culture war aspects of the internet into our space, using a variety of tactics to provoke anger and discomfort.<p>I&#x27;m a generally conflict-avoidant person so this took getting used to. On the server, I had to learn to be willing to ban the persistent trolls. I want to provide a space where people can grow and mature as I was given on IRC and web forums back in the early 2000s instead of a place that throws people out at the first hint of having &quot;incorrect&quot; beliefs. Unfortunately this gave too much leeway to people that were consistently there to recreationally troll or promote genuinely hateful movements.<p>I became much more free with both temporary and permanent bans and made the signup intentionally cumbersome, wracked with nerves about the &quot;good&quot; folks who might be intimidated. I still have that anxiety, but ever since increasing the scrutiny on applications and doing more banning we&#x27;ve had a much more stable community environment.<p>I read a lot of books on digital communities; the Virtual Community by Howard Rheingold is a great starting point, but the book that helped me the most was Cyber Chiefs by Mathieu O’Neil. It helped me understand that all communities that manage to grow over time will hit an unsustainable point and either retract or dissipate.<p>Dissipation was a real possibility; for a long time I felt completely emotionally burned out by the town. I chose retraction though, and in retrospect, it was the right choice.<p>I&#x27;m still learning and thinking all the time about ways to encourage quieter or less technologically inclined people to sign up and make a home on the town and am always excited to talk about it or hear ideas.<p>(edited to clarify i&#x27;m not the only admin)"],"time":["2020-08-28 18:27:41"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["phre4k"],"id":[24302860],"kids":[24303112,24303159],"parent":[24300907],"text":["I run tilde.fun.

To get into any train station at all involved 3 levels of checkpoints, the first checkpoint started before you got to the plaza before the train station, so checking in took about 3 hours. In Kashgar the old city had checkpoints at every corner. The entire province only had 3G, the moment you cross over from neighboring Gansu your China Telecom signal dropped from 4G, so sending videos or even pictures is very difficult even on weChat, if you try to do it through a VPN the experience is even slower.<p>Some checkpoints were vigilant, but in my experience most were just bored. One checkpoint basically forgot to check my ID because I was seated all the at the back of a van. Young Uighur men or woman sometimes with a Han standing around or sitting at a chair with a desk in the middle of the street, writing down the names of everyone who crosses his &quot;stand&quot;.<p>What surprised me the most was that most of the guards manning the checkpoints in towns, highways, at gas stations (which involved a full car search in order to pull into) were Uighurs themselves. I get the impression you basically went to jail or joined the security apparatus, a modern variation on a old Chinese strategem of using barbarian to fight barbarian I guess.<p>The whole experience changed my perspective on human beings in general.

I currently run off an Intel NUC, which works perfectly fine, but I have a Thinkpad now on the way. I figured I&#x27;d do a writeup because I&#x27;m a designer and that makes me a little bit of a freak.<p>First, I was already a vim user for 8 years, so I was used to config files and the terminal. I moved primarily after watching some videos about I3 &#x2F; awesome WM and browsing the &#x2F;r&#x2F;unixporn subreddit. Primarily I liked the idea of designing my own OS from scratch, and the idea of being able to change ANYTHING was really intriguing to me.<p>I guess it&#x27;s important to note that as a designer this wouldn&#x27;t have been possible without tools like Figma and Framer being web based. Put bluntly, Linux native design tooling isn&#x27;t up to par with what I had on a mac, and without Figma I wouldn&#x27;t have been able to move over full-time. It&#x27;s also important to mention that while I classify myself as a designer, I design 90% of the time in code, writing React + CSS. I realize I&#x27;m a little different and this likely sways some of my feelings towards linux.<p>In short, I&#x27;ve really enjoyed the switch. The window management alone has been reason enough. Being able to navigate my windows with key commands, and generally lay things out the way I see fit between polybar + i3 has been fantastic. Don&#x27;t like a certain shadow? Change it with picom. Don&#x27;t like seeing title bars on your windows? Change a config. I&#x27;m also a designer that believes in heavy focus (think tab focus in a browser) so every window gets a thick focus border. Everything is matched to a color-scheme that I like, and I mean everything. I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m using Linux so much as I&#x27;ve used Linux to build Dave OS.<p>I was able to migrate nearly $500 of annual tooling to home-made scripts and services that I run through GCP. For example. I used to use cloud app for screenshot &#x2F; movie snippets. Any designer will tell you something like that is their bread and butter... &quot;hey what do you think of this?&quot;. I moved it to Peek &#x2F; Flameshot + a 40-line bash script that watches a folder and uploads it to a gcp bucket. It took me a half day of learning. At the end of it I had a funny realization... why have I been paying for these simple services for years and complaining about features they didn&#x27;t have? Now I just add the features.<p>Performance is hit and miss. Everything I used to do in the terminal (which is where I spend most of my time) feels faster. In general, I had to drop apps and move command line. This was fun! I moved to buku for bookmarks, taskwarrior for todo lists...etc. What I loved about this was it forced me to engage more in the OSS community. I already do mostly OSS stuff for work, but I was in my bubble. Linux forced me out, and I found myself talking a bit more on Github, asking questions and the like. This was the thing that I&#x27;ve ended up loving. In general I&#x27;ve been amazed at the amount of support I&#x27;ve gotten from maintainers by just saying &quot;Hey, I&#x27;m a designer, I&#x27;m not so knowledgeable about the guts of this code, can you help me out&quot;?<p>Slack and zoom are slow. They are pretty resource intensive apps and weren&#x27;t exactly speed kings on my mac, but they do feel noticibly worse on Linux. I&#x27;m hoping this is due to my hardware, but I suspect the apps just aren&#x27;t as considered in Linux. I&#x27;ve really enjoyed AUR &#x2F; pacman for package management and it feels like brew, but for everything. The one thing I think Linux is missing is a good calendar application that syncs with gcal. The terminal based ones are a little overweight and underdesigned, and I can&#x27;t find a GUI one I like.<p>Anyways, I&#x27;ll probably do a formal blog writeup at some point, and more importantly make some videos of my setup, since it&#x27;s probably interesting for folks to see how a designer uses Linux, but I thought it&#x27;d be worth a quick post to let others know its possible.<p>Hardware wise I had no trouble with my mac, mostly because I already had my own custom keyboards and the like, but I&#x27;m excited about the new Thinkpad on the way more for it&#x27;s power-to-price."],"time":["2020-08-28 16:15:33"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["puranjay"],"id":[24307866],"kids":{},"parent":[24303938],"text":["I moved to a Thinkpad from Macbook.

The pain of emailing documents is real, but the comfort level with how Word works is also real. Over the years, most organizations have developed internal workflows to share and send documents around that bypass the pains, and while they may not be perfect, they work.<p>The funny thing is that the document authors like these ways of working. It is the tech people who don&#x27;t. I&#x27;ve seen &quot;Git for Word&quot; proposed many times a year for a while now. And all of the ideas are interesting, but none of them appeal to my audience because they don&#x27;t care about git&#x27;s feature set. Nobody wants to branch and merge. Nobody wants a straight version history. (&quot;Nobody&quot; meaning nobody in my market, not nobody in the world.)<p>They want a storytelling experience. They want to know the why, not the what. And the workflow tends to be unidirectional, not with collaborative changes coming back together, but with expanding changes as each person adds their ideas and makes change for a specific instance of using a document. The experience we build for them bring in pieces of version history, pieces of comments, pieces of telling the story of why something was done, so people down the line can have more context to decide whether to accept or reject the changes.<p>It isn&#x27;t that &quot;Git for Word&quot; is a bad idea - on the contrary, it would be great if someone pulls it off. My point is that building something that improves on Word isn&#x27;t actually about the software, it is about the document workflows. If you find groups who work like software devs do, where documents receive small updates from a team, and bring all changes together for a final product, there is probably a market. But when evaluating such ideas, there has to be a reality check of whether the actual use of the documents truly matches the use case for git."],"time":["2020-08-28 12:57:33"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["tomashubelbauer"],"id":[24303611],"kids":[24306848,24305092,24307027],"parent":[24302896],"text":["I&#x27;ve mentioned this in a similar thread a few months back, but it looks like it could be relevant here, too:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;TomasHubelbauer&#x2F;modern-office-git-diff\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;TomasHubelbauer&#x2F;modern-office-git-diff<\/a><p>I&#x27;ve made this script which automatically extracts the Office file format (which is a ZIP archive of XML documents) and versions the XML documents and their extracted text contents alongside the binary Office file.

If you&#x27;re writing a book or article, then the graphic designers and typesetters are going to make the design decisions, not the author, so why bother messing around with fonts and colours and the infuriating placement of images and tables.<p>I authored a kid&#x27;s book on coding, and the process was a nightmare. I authored in markdown, used pandoc to convert and then further edited in libreoffice, to be able to send stuff through in docx format. Then revisions were sent back in docx and I had to reverse the whole process, so I could maintain my plain-text version of the book. Then the proofs were sent through as PDFs, which I then had to markup for corrections. Many of the mistakes were due to the crappy way Word places images. In the end I just bought a copy of Word, and submitted to the way my publisher wanted me to work, which disrupted the authorial process.<p>It&#x27;s time we ditched Word, in the same way we ditched VHS and DVD. It&#x27;s an outdated technology that remains dominant just because everyone uses it at school, and then refuses to move on. If schools insisted that all homework was submitted in something like markdown, we&#x27;d see a dramatic change in a very short period of time.

We managed to change some money on the street.\n- a room at a normal hotel costs more than 80 USD, we found something similar to a hostel for 15 USD and still went to the Grand Turkmen, acted like we stayed there and stole some Internet\n- a SIM card with 1 GiB of Internet was around 40 USD, we passed\n- the Internet goes through an IPS that blocks everything we use in the western world: FB, Gmail, Whatsapp, VPNs etc. I had to tunnel through an SSH server listening on port 443 just to be able to send an email.

And the unemployment rate captures only part of the story. Having declined significantly in the five years following the crisis, the labor force participation rate flattened out and began rising even though the aging of the population suggested that it should keep falling.<p>The entire press release is worth a read, but I want to specifically call out the above quote.  I think looking into these two statistics can form the basis for useful discussion.<p>Unemployment rate being &quot;below estimated sustainable levels&quot; has multiple interpretations, some charitable, some less so.  One is that the current economy is better at allocating people to their jobs.  This isn&#x27;t a theory, just a hypothesis. Gig economy work, increases in highly skilled workers (Who traditionally have had lower unemployment than less-educated cohorts [0]) might be drivers that could reduce the friction of getting a job for contemporary workers.<p>To add another possible hypothesis, it could be that people are just hedging.  If a large enough cohort of people feel unsafe or want to adjust their job risk profile, they might choose to commit to employment prior to a downturn.  If people are hedging, we might even see a decrease in real wage as people value the (weak, but albeit better than nothing) insurance they get instead of being valued entirely by their market rate wage.<p>The labor force participation component, frankly, I&#x27;m confused on. The Bureau of Labor statics release clearly shows labor participation has been and is still falling (Covid blip aside, 5 year time window irrespective) [1].  Their footnote calls out the 25-54 year old bracket, which is apparently participating more.  I can see why they say that the labor force participation rising is unexpected, I certainly don&#x27;t see it.<p>To advance a different thesis, it is entirely possible that as people retire, a less than whole percent of their roles are being filled by people in this younger cohort, who can now more easily participate due to less labor being available for existing companies.  This would align more with the BLS and Federal Reserve numbers, as we have, by percentage, more aged individuals (Who are the primary non-participants) in addition to growth in a cohort who we would expect to fill those rolls moving forward.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bls.gov&#x2F;charts&#x2F;employment-situation&#x2F;unemployment-rates-for-persons-25-years-and-older-by-educational-attainment.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bls.gov&#x2F;charts&#x2F;employment-situation&#x2F;unemployment...<\/a><p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bls.gov&#x2F;charts&#x2F;employment-situation&#x2F;civilian-labor-force-participation-rate.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bls.gov&#x2F;charts&#x2F;employment-situation&#x2F;civilian-lab...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-08-28 03:33:31"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["viburnum"],"id":[24300794],"kids":{},"parent":[24300305],"text":["This article explains the Volcker era and subsequent events in plain language<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nplusonemag.com&#x2F;issue-34&#x2F;reviews&#x2F;other-peoples-blood-2&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nplusonemag.com&#x2F;issue-34&#x2F;reviews&#x2F;other-peoples-blood...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-08-28 04:22:45"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["viig99"],"id":[24301580],"kids":{},"parent":[24300305],"text":["Winter is here, ah damn."],"time":["2020-08-28 07:17:25"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["justanotheranon"],"id":[24301971],"kids":{},"parent":[24300305],"text":["after hyperinflation finally hits, as the Ron Paulite fringe has been predicting for over 20 years, i hope they put Trump&#x27;s big beautiful tremendous mug on the $1 trillion dollar bill.<p>i look forward to 2035 and warming myself up by burning trash bags full of trumpbux in an oil drum underneath an empty freeway overpass."],"time":["2020-08-28 08:35:56"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["FriendlyNormie"],"id":[24302411],"kids":{},"parent":[24300305],"text":["Jews rock!"],"time":["2020-08-28 09:53:59"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":{},"id":[24300469],"kids":{},"parent":[24300305],"text":{},"time":["2020-08-28 03:20:10"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":[true]},{"by":["codecamper"],"id":[24302006],"kids":{},"parent":[24300305],"text":["free money for the billionaires and inflation for the rest.  lovely."],"time":["2020-08-28 08:44:03"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}}]
