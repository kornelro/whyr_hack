I&#x27;m a little surprised that this is hacker news which means majority of audience are rational so they can differentiate belief and fact. (In this situation fact is unreachable just like what Iraq did: if you give the investigator access it just give the lair more credit and make lie more deceitful. CPP may or may not know that.)<p>This strange phenomenon that large population can be cheated again and again puzzled me for long time until recently after HK demonstration and BLM. People (I&#x27;m not referring rioters) act based on fake information, create fake&#x2F;untrue information  by distorted narrative. My hypothesis is there&#x27;s some evolutionary reason behind it: Human intelligence were evolved and perfected from thousands years of fight. It&#x27;s part of metabolism of society. People need <i>cause<\/i> as a spiritual stimulus  to fight. Evil is a human invention to launch attack to other humans called enemy to justify their aggression.<p>There are a couple of guys who seem to be against this irrational trend but they are also victim of exact the same human cognition flaw. One guy is Bret Weinstein,an evolutionary biologist. He is a smart smart rational professor who had fought against a movement seems to have high moral ground but distort the truth in reality.  But when he mentioned &quot;organ harvest&quot;in China as if it&#x27;s a fact(Most Chinese people know where the story comes from) , I suddenly found he himself became another version of his former enemy who fight for &quot;Good&quot; cause as if he a decent human being,  without question the facts. He is doing exactly what he was against.<p>Good cause as a spiritual demand is a drug that lead sane people into delusion. It&#x27;s so attractive that people need it so much , they create their own reality, reinforce  beliefs within peers, occasionally resulted in war with other group who don&#x27;t have the same illusion."],"time":["2020-09-09 06:34:06"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["seibelj"],"id":[24415225],"kids":[24415319,24415341,24416763,24415493,24415260,24415756],"parent":[24413823],"text":["I’m going to tell you a secret that maybe you don’t understand - these tomatoes will be exported to another country and then imported to the US minus the extra costs."],"time":["2020-09-09 02:18:04"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["nitrobeast"],"id":[24415944],"kids":[24415958],"parent":[24413823],"text":["What’s the difference between forced labor in China, vs prisoner firefighter in California?"],"time":["2020-09-09 03:56:08"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["tehjoker"],"id":[24415438],"kids":[24415669,24415906,24415945,24415679,24415600],"parent":[24413823],"text":["tbh, I&#x27;m not sure if I believe the allegations. Most of the most serious assertions have come from people connected to the CIA and the various Radio Free * newsources that come from the state department. Very few of these stories are independently verified and the numbers claimed are comical. Of 11M people, they claim 3M are in camps. A friend of mine&#x27;s sister just visited XJ and said it was fine. You can&#x27;t hide 3M people out of 11M. Given the anti-China stance of the ruling class right now, I am extremely skeptical of various scurrilous claims being bandied about. The US routinely lies about official enemies and has for decades (nay centuries), so their record should speak for itself. A recent example is the Iraq War and WMD. Another famous example is the Gulf of Tonkin incident.<p>For example, the US news reported that the UN had condemned the practices in XJ, but in fact it was one US person on one commission that didn&#x27;t represent the UN as a whole. The US media has to do more than mere assertion. In any case, the current fascist US regime has little credibility on human rights issues given their open support for police murders and various policies of ripping children away from travelers and imprisoning them.<p>I&#x27;d like to say show me the evidence, but unfortunately when I try to read chinese government documents or political discourse I am befuddled by my inability to read chinese.  :-&#x2F; Note how many US reporters on these stories cannot either."],"time":["2020-09-09 02:49:18"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["PureParadigm"],"id":[24419205],"kids":[24419354,24419857,24419479,24419880,24419256,24419235,24421458],"parent":[24419042],"text":["I think this can definitely save you time in some cases, but usually at the expense of other people.

Here, the Napoleon technique would save me time but only by wasting the other person&#x27;s time.

Turns out that Murakami&#x27;s prose is highly structured, with subtle cross-refereces that, if translated differently will &#x27;de-sync&#x27; and leave the reader of a translated version without the clues to understanding the real structure of the novel.<p>While an example of a structurally meaningful cross-reference escapes me at the moment, I do remember a different example of a structural clue. It occurs in the &#x27;Hear the Wind Sing&#x27;, the first book of the Sheep Trilogy, which ends in the much-recommended &#x27;A Wild Sheep Chase&#x27; (technically it was later followed with a 4th book in &#x27;Dance, Dance, Dance&#x27; so it&#x27;s a 4-book trilogy).

If you follow the other time references given in the book -- such as days of the week mentioned on the radio etc -- this time frame given cannot possibly be true. The assumption that it is not an author&#x27;s mistake gives a hint that there is a hidden structure to the novel, which on its face looks fairly simple and linear.<p>I personally think that it is very difficult to get to like Murakami if you start with &#x27;Kafka&#x27; or, god forbid, the &#x27;Wind-up Bird&#x27;.

He wrote the novel in English first, and translated that English version into Japanese. His reason being &quot;if it is English, my vocabulary is not that great, so I&#x27;m forced to write in short sentences, which creates this natural rhythm. Kind of like an 8 beat.&quot; [1]<p>Being bilingual, I often find myself pondering whether I should write something for myself in English or in Japanese for tasks such as note taking or journal&#x2F;blog entries for myself. More and more, I&#x27;m finding that my writing in English is clearer, and more to the point. Not only that, but my thinking is structured in a more productive way, so I can write at a faster pace.<p>This was not meant to be a comparison of languages. We have enough of those discussions with programming, why would we talk about Natural Languages and risk angering a whole nation, instead of just Java programmers. Maybe my Japanese is no longer at the level of my English. But when somebody like Murakami also says that he wrote his first novel in English because it was easier for him, I feel there might be something there besides my English being better than my Japanese. Something worth exploring at least.<p>There are many great things about Japanese writing, the kanji characters bring about conciseness to the writing. I can glance at a page and quickly get a sense of the contents from the face of the characters much easier than English text. The characters feel closer to pictures. I also love the style of the &quot;Bunkobon&quot;, which is a smaller sized book, which can fit inside a pocket. I used to carry those everywhere with me and pull it out when I had a moment.<p>The novels and stories are great. People like Haruki and Souseki and Ranpo are my heroes.<p>I guess my Kokugo teacher would have liked for me to mention the beautiful poetry that arises from Haiku and the seasons, but those things are no longer practical use to me.<p>On the other hand, there are also many mental blocks and barriers that I face when writing Japanese. Finding the right Kanji characters is one thing. That&#x27;s probably attributed to my poor memory of kanji characters. Another thing is sentence endings: Desu&#x2F;masu and dearu&#x2F;da. The Desu&#x2F;masu is a more respectful tone. Dearu&#x2F;da is authoritative and sometimes regarded as casual. So now in addition to wondering whether I should write in the first person or third person, I have to worry whether my reader will be offended by my writing.<p>Anyway, would love to hear from other multilingual people on their views of language preference and differences.<p>[1] This was from an interview he did with a magazine called &quot;Kaie&quot;, The New Yorker also mentions this <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newyorker.com&#x2F;books&#x2F;page-turner&#x2F;lost-in-translation\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newyorker.com&#x2F;books&#x2F;page-turner&#x2F;lost-in-translat...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-09-10 01:31:14"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["willyg123"],"id":[24418055],"kids":[24420879,24422061,24429797,24418986],"parent":[24417015],"text":["Out of college I worked on the finance side of a self storage investment company (thank god I left after 4 years), so I know the ins and outs of the business.<p>The number one deciding factor for customers is location.

This is admittedly more rigorous work than previous efforts to train language models to perform automated theorem proving and it&#x27;s admirable that the authors have actually reached out to the community around Metamath (the classical automated theorem prover used in the paper) to understand the extent to which their work is useful to that community.<p>That said, I don&#x27;t understand the motivation of the work. Why is it necessary to teach a language model to perform automated theorm proving, when there are already approaches that can perform automated theorem proving, that outperform language models in theorem proving and that do not have the high costs associated with training language models? Indeed, Metamath is based on an extremly simple principle of variable substitution, which is just what it sounds like and comparing the complexity of a modern, GPT-based language model to such a simple approach is not flattering for the language model approach. Besides if I understand correctly, Metamath, was used as the &quot;ground truth&quot; for evaluation and testing of the trained language model and the language model didn&#x27;t get anywhere near 100% performance, meaning it&#x27;s far behind the ability of Metamath in automated theorem proving. So we have a very simple approach that works very well on one side and an extremely complex approach that doesn&#x27;t work very well on the other. The comparison is, again, not flattering for the language model approach.<p>I can see that GPT-ƒ (the language model in the paper) has contributed some shorter proofs to some theorems in Metamath&#x27;s database, which seems to be very much appreciated by the Metamath community, but on the other hand, it seems that GPT-ƒ was not able to prove <i>new<\/i> theorems (and a shorter version of a theorem proved by GPT-ƒ was found by hand, by one of the Metamath users, a little after the GPT-ƒ results were announced on the Metamath google group).<p>It seems to me it would be a long and arduous road for language models to achieve parity with classical automated theorem provers - if indeed such parity can be achieved at all. And all this hard work- for what, when there already exist perfectly serviceable automated theorem provers with none of the drawbacks of language models)? Why reinvent a wheel, only to come up with a new wheel that can only roll one way and only on Tuesdays?<p>Finally, despite the more rigorous approach in this paper, the trend of only comparing neural net approaches to other neural net approaches continues. An automated theorem prover approach of any stripe should be compared to the state of the art in automated theorm proving, not just to other efforts using a similar approach! Imagine if I wanted to present a new image recognition algorithm based on automated theorem proving and ommitted comparison with Convolutional Neural Nets!"],"time":["2020-09-10 14:06:24"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["masa331"],"id":[24419955],"kids":[24420880],"parent":[24419947],"text":["Hi everybody, author here<p>this is simple tool i created to solve a couple of pain points i had when viewing XMLs.

In the vast majority of OOP languages, instantiated classes are mutable-by-default and can be mutated by multiple concurrent operators (threads, coroutines, etc). This makes them actually quite similar to the underlying computing model - even though they&#x27;re a high-level abstraction, they force you to deal with the knowledge that the memory at any address can be modified at any time with no warning. [1]<p>Classes in most languages also offer implementation inheritance, which boils down to an approach to &quot;rebundling&quot; the constituent functions in ways that are arguably simple enough, but generally in practice it has been found to be hard for programmers to reason about. Dynamic dispatch is very powerful, and the way that most inheritance mechanisms expose this seems to be a model that programmers understand in theory but fail to consistently remember in practice.<p>In my opinion, the fundamental difficulty with classes is that in most languages, you get all of these tools bundled (complected) into the same toolbox without any say in the matter. If you didn&#x27;t want inheritance, too bad. If you didn&#x27;t want concurrent mutability, you&#x27;re now being asked to design a complex state machine to prevent it, rather than it being excluded off the bat by most functional approaches. Functional approaches force you to opt in to most of the footguns that are included &quot;out of the box&quot; in OOP.<p>Classes will remain the best approach in many OOP languages for RAII-shaped problems, where some part of an application needs to encapsulate and manage a limited, shared, and potentially mutable resource (such as a file handle, a database connection, or an in-memory cache), because classes are an abstraction that maps cleanly to shared mutable state with locking mechanisms.<p>[1] You can of course also shoot yourself in the foot with closures that themselves contain mutable state (e.g. some kind of mutable container), and I think this is a rarely-considered danger for functional paradigms in languages that default to mutable data structures."],"time":["2020-09-09 19:34:09"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["knubie"],"id":[24425370],"kids":{},"parent":[24422547],"text":["OOP is an abstraction over functions, but it can be explained much more simply without closures.

Functional has been around for 30+ years. OOP won against functional because OOP is easier to understand and leads to more maintainable code. These days people are taking a second look at functional because functional avoids state, which makes it easier to write concurrent code with no locks. (This has suddenly become important because Moore&#x27;s law is coming to an end, and CPUs are adding more cores instead of making cores faster and faster.) But this advantage of functional is not applicable to JavaScript because there are no locks in JavaScript in any case!<p>Functional programming actually brings some benefits to backend code. To take advantage of the extra cores in a CPU you add threads, but if these threads are continually needing to lock in order to serialize access to shared state then concurrency is diminished. The more cores you have, the more threads you have, and then the more you have to lock. Functional style solves this problem by not having mutable state.<p>But when it comes to JavaScript these benefits don&#x27;t exist. That&#x27;s not to say there are no benefits at all to incorporating some functional style into JavaScript code, but wholesale replacement of OOP with functional style is not warranted."],"time":["2020-09-09 18:42:58"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["hashkb"],"id":[24422856],"kids":[24422944],"parent":[24422547],"text":["See also: Let Over Lambda for more on this."],"time":["2020-09-09 18:43:12"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["greenie_beans"],"id":[24423365],"kids":{},"parent":[24422547],"text":["would any devs want to start a book club for books like this? the article mentions SICP, which is on my to-read list. it just seems so daunting. i&#x27;m currently reading practical object oriented design in ruby by sandi metz. would love to have somebody to discuss some books like this."],"time":["2020-09-09 19:24:16"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["aaron-santos"],"id":[24422923],"kids":{},"parent":[24422547],"text":["Tangentially related is the idea that some OO constructs can be represented as co-data.

Many also are fine creating software that is permissively licensed because people write software for all sorts of reasons, fame and recognition being one.<p>It does make me glad to see this narrative coming up on HN though -- the corporatization of OSS has been happening for a long time now and needs more attention drawn to it.

People were literally bolted into their apartment complexes. China has a gross disrespect for individual rights that the West should never, ever adopt. We don&#x27;t even know what the extent of Covid deaths are in China. We actually have no clue, because all information is tightly controlled by the CCP. Anything coming from China should be viewed through a lens of skepticism.<p>Meanwhile, from the viewpoint of Covid, I think Sweden showed that it would have been just the same results if we simply left people to make their own choices and decisions about how to react based on their own personal risk profiles and tolerance. This idea of centrally managing a mega region like Europe or the United States is absurd, and bound to fail. The states in the U.S. with the tightest regulations on Covid have had the highest death rates and the highest amount of social unrest.

I&#x27;m shocked that standards for writing have dropped so low.<p>Consider this paragraph:<p>&gt; Democracy’s fetishisation of freedom inevitably gives way to anarchy. Fathers pander to their sons, teachers to their pupils, humans to animals, and ‘the minds of the citizens become so sensitive that the least vestige of restraint is resented as intolerable’. Anarchy produces class struggle, as the poor attack the rich and the rich retaliate; class struggle produces war and disorder. When all this becomes intolerable the masses will turn to a dictator who can restore order.<p>It&#x27;s meaningless! Democracy apparently makes &quot;humans pander to animals.&quot; Why does this happen? Just because! The author spits out this weird gob of nonsense and continues as if he&#x27;s made a real argument that democracy always leads to anarchy (which, confusingly, leads to class conflict, and not the other way around).<p>He does mention uneducated voters making bad decisions earlier, but that&#x27;s a whole other can of worms that he never even digs into (i.e. can we fix this with education reforms, or by introducing new journalistic standards into media?). He just throws it out there as if it&#x27;s all the proof he needs that only &quot;wise elites&quot; can save us from ourselves.<p>How about this part:<p>&gt; Thus the paradox at the heart of tyranny: even though tyrants have absolute power over other people, they have no power over themselves. Slaves to their own passions – ‘ill-governed’ in their own souls as Plato puts it – they use their positions to inflict those passions on the entire population. A tyranny is a psycho-drama in which everyone is caught up in the tyrant’s raging ego.<p>This is flatly untrue. Let&#x27;s look at some of the greatest tyrants of the 21st century. Xi Jinping, Vladmir Putin, the Saudis... we could go on. Are any of these people particularly prone to temper tantrums? &quot;Slaves of their own passions&quot;? No! They&#x27;re ruthless, disciplined, and experts at consolidating and leveraging power. This weird psychoanalysis of authoritarianism has no basis in fact -- it&#x27;s just storytelling.<p>Finally, scraping away the abysmal analysis, we get the actual argument:<p>&gt; The metaphor of the ship is a way of driving home Plato’s wider point about the importance of ‘guardians’. Plato argues that a successful republic is run by a class of people whose job it is to think about the long-term success of the polis.<p>The trouble with this is that putting a discreet class of people in charge of society leads to those people acting in their own interests. The whole motivating reason behind democracy is for the public to have a veto on their leadership so that leaders can&#x27;t act in their own interest. The author&#x27;s solution is &quot;let&#x27;s educate our leaders not to act in their own interest,&quot; but that&#x27;s practically a childish suggestion. What part of history has ever suggested that you can educate humans out of their innate instinct to act in self-interest?The author provides basically no real examples. Who gets to decide how these rulers are educated? The rulers? Wow I&#x27;m sure we can trust them not to act in their self-interest in that regard. After all, they &quot;educated&quot; themselves not to.<p>They did include a couple vague gestures at evidence:<p>&gt; Benjamin Jowett, the master of Balliol from 1870 until his death in 1893, devoted his life to two great projects: producing a definitive edition of Plato and turning his college into a production line for Platonic guardians.<p>&gt; [...]<p>&gt; There was a certain amount of priggishness in the cult of Plato. But it nevertheless produced an elite that was remarkably public spirited by today’s standards: too dignified to put its fingers in the cookie jar and too well-educated to be blown hither and thither by the latest intellectual fads. The old elite didn’t hog publicity for the sake of publicity – most of them were happy to work in the background without any public credit – and they wouldn’t dream of piling up vast private fortunes. This was a world of modest but tasteful cottages in the country, not swanky apartments in Belgravia or Manhattan. Dignified public service was its own reward.<p>But again, that says nothing. Who exactly are we referring to here? Which individuals led so well? By which metrics? How do they compare against other leaders? No actual evidence, just a bunch of emotionally-loaded language. The period in question (19th century England) was absolutely abysmal for workers&#x27; rights, by the way. It was the workers&#x27; movement -- a grassroots populist movement -- that ultimately led to pro-worker reforms. Not &quot;wise Platonic leaders.&quot;<p>TL;DR this article doesn&#x27;t make any real arguments, and relies on emotionally-loaded language and appeals to the nobility of elites rather than the material conditions of history."],"time":["2020-09-10 01:10:20"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Kednicma"],"id":[24427091],"kids":[24427450,24429002],"parent":[24410627],"text":["Right, we need a tough-guy philosopher-king who wrestles his opponents into submission."],"time":["2020-09-10 01:18:45"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["calvinmorrison"],"id":[24422812],"kids":[24423097,24422914,24422991,24422952,24423086,24422875,24422905,24423396,24423616,24423191,24422975,24423088,24423406],"parent":[24422368],"text":["At the core, google and other companies sell your data for advertisements, at best, at worst they&#x27;re sending it all the NSA or some other black box.<p>I recommend everyone BUY A DOMAIN.

The light green lines are adiabats -- air rising or falling will follow along these lines until water condenses.  The big red line is temperature, and the big green one is dewpoint temperature -- where the lines touch there&#x27;s a cloud.<p>So what we have here are large inversion layers, where temperature increases with height.  Normally, the red line goes mostly straight up the graphy, as lowering pressure should lower temperature of air. And indeed, this creates a cap, where air above and below the edge of the inversion gets trapped.<p>These huge inversions are why the smoke is largely staying above the ground.  It rises hot from the fire, but any sinking would be countered by the buoyance of the air wanting to keep it up.  Mixing at the boundary layer is slow with this strong of an inversion.<p>But the inversion is also low, which means that the temperature differences with altitude can be extreme.

Not badly, he said, just a little when you shoved hard on them. I warned him not to use his adjustable wrench on the tightening nuts. It was likely to damage the chrome and start small rust spots. He agreed to use my metric sockets and box-ends.<p>When he brought his motorcycle over I got my wrenches out but then noticed that no amount of tightening would stop the slippage, because the ends of the collars were pinched shut.<p>&quot;You’re going to have to shim those out,&quot; I said.<p>&quot;What’s shim?&quot;<p>&quot;It’s a thin, flat strip of metal. You just slip it around the handlebar under the collar there and it will open up the collar to where you can tighten it again. You use shims like that to make adjustments in all kinds of machines.&quot;<p>&quot;Oh,&quot; he said. He was getting interested. &quot;Good. Where do you buy them?&quot;<p>&quot;I’ve got some right here,&quot; I said gleefully, holding up a can of beer in my hand.<p>He didn’t understand for a moment. Then he said, &quot;What, the can?&quot;<p>&quot;Sure,&quot; I said, &quot;best shim stock in the world.&quot;<p>I thought this was pretty clever myself. Save him a trip to God knows where to get shim stock. Save him time. Save him money.<p>But to my surprise he didn’t see the cleverness of this at all. In fact he got noticeably haughty about the whole thing. Pretty soon he was dodging and filling with all kinds of excuses and, before I realized what his real attitude was, we had decided not to fix the handlebars after all.<p>As far as I know those handlebars are still loose. And I believe now that he was actually offended at the time. I had had the nerve to propose repair of his new eighteen-hundred dollar BMW, the pride of a half-century of German mechanical finesse, with a piece of old beer can!<p>Ach, du lieber!<p>Since then we have had very few conversations about motorcycle maintenance. None, now that I think of it.<p>You push it any further and suddenly you are angry, without knowing why.<p>I should say, to explain this, that beer-can aluminum is soft and sticky, as metals go. Perfect for the application. Aluminum doesn’t oxidize in wet weather...or, more precisely, it always has a thin layer of oxide that prevents any further oxidation. Also perfect.<p>In other words, any true German mechanic, with a half-century of mechanical finesse behind him, would have concluded that this particular solution to this particular technical problem was perfect.<p>For a while I thought what I should have done was sneak over to the workbench, cut a shim from the beer can, remove the printing and then come back and tell him we were in luck, it was the last one I had, specially imported from Germany. That would have done it. A special shim from the private stock of Baron Alfred Krupp, who had to sell it at a great sacrifice. Then he would have gone gaga over it.<p>That Krupp’s-private-shim fantasy gratified me for a while, but then it wore off and I saw it was just being vindictive. In its place grew that old feeling I’ve talked about before, a feeling that there’s something bigger involved than is apparent on the surface. You follow these little discrepancies long enough and they sometimes open up into huge revelations. There was just a feeling on my part that this was something a little bigger than I wanted to take on without thinking about it, and I turned instead to my usual habit of trying to extract causes and effects to see what was involved that could possibly lead to such an impasse between John’s view of that lovely shim and my own. This comes up all the time in mechanical work. A hang-up. You just sit and stare and think, and search randomly for new information, and go away and come back again, and after a while the unseen factors start to emerge.<p>What emerged in vague form at first and then in sharper outline was the explanation that I had been seeing that shim in a kind of intellectual, rational, cerebral way in which the scientific properties of the metal were all that counted. John was going at it immediately and intuitively, grooving on it. I was going at it in terms of underlying form. He was going at it in terms of immediate appearance. I was seeing what the shim meant. He was seeing what the shim was. That’s how I arrived at that distinction. And when you see what the shim is, in this case, it’s depressing. Who likes to think of a beautiful precision machine fixed with an old hunk of junk?<p>-- Robert M.

While the Swedish Corona strategy is not explicitly designed to be contrarian at the world stage (and therefor get a lot of attention), the way Swedish mono-culture works is that the people who implement policy (as well as many citizens) chauvinistically and subconsciously believe that Sweden is somehow superior to other nations and at the same time believe that Sweden (as an exceptional country) has something to teach inferior countries (i.e all other countries).<p>So where we are right now is that we have this unhealthy feedback loop where Sweden initially did it&#x27;s own thing, and as it turned out to be different that has been a signal to policy makers that Sweden is right. Because Sweden is exceptional, so if the policy is different from inferior countries (i.e all other countries), it must be right.<p>I wish, probably more than anything else, that other countries would just stop giving Swedish policy makers this attention because then maybe, hopefully, our politicians can start to do what&#x27;s right for our citizens instead of what gets attention and talking points at the world stage.<p>This is far broader than Corona: Sweden gets way too much attention overall, because Swedish politicians and government communication employees have nailed &quot;marketing&quot; more than anything else. They crave this attention and they manufacture policy to get attention, at the expense of the people who live in the country. Often under the guise of marketing Sweden as a &quot;moral super power&quot;, superior to other nations.<p>So please, if you are for example a left leaning American, please don&#x27;t use Sweden as a political piece.

Now the virus is less deadly because there are fewer people left who are vulnerable to it.<p>At the start of the pandemic Anders Tegnel, the architect of Sweden&#x27;s response to the virus, did not believe that asymptomatic carriers existed [1], so Sweden&#x27;s Public Health Agency instructed health workers in care homes to only stay at home if they had symptoms and to not wear any PPE at work [2]. So they carried the virus into the care homes and a hecatomb of old people ensued.<p>Obviously, now that the most vulnerable are gone, the virus kills many fewer patients. Swedes don&#x27;t even need to have immunity to the virus, as such. They just need to be young and healthy enough to survive it if they get it. Not so much heard immunity, as herd culling.<p>For comparison, let&#x27;s take Greece, where I&#x27;m from and which is a country with a similar population to that of Sweden (about 10 million each). Greece imposed a draconian lockdown in early March, as soon as the severity of the pandemic became obvious (we are right next to Italy, after all). The result was about ~2500 infections and ~140 dead by 1st July when the lockdown was lifted [3]. Remember, that&#x27;s in a country with a similar population as Sweden (but with a much more touchy-feely, huggy-kissy, family-dinner Mediterrannean culture than Sweden). Now we&#x27;ve opened our borders and we&#x27;re doing business (= tourism) as usual. Infections have also risen, but deaths are still very low, in the single or low double digits daily, so that about 300 people have died <i>since the start of the pandemic<\/i>. It&#x27;s all pretty manageable and our health system is not overwhelmed.<p>We had a total lockdown, lost very few people, but we&#x27;re back in action and deaths are low despite rising infections. And without letting our old and vulnerable die in their thousands. We lost 300, Sweden lost 6,000.

Multiplying the percent case increases for the high, moderate-high and moderate inflow counties by each county’s respective pre-rally cumulative COVID-19 cases and aggregating, yields a total of 263,708 additional cases in these locations due to the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally.  Adding the number of new cases due to the Rally in South Dakota estimated by synthetic control (3.6 per 1,000 population, scaled by the South Dakota population of approximately 858,000) brings the total number of cases to 266,796 or 19 percent of 1.4 million new cases.<p>&gt; If we conservatively assume that all of these cases were non-fatal, then these cases represent a cost of over $12.2 billion, based on the statistical cost of a COVID-19 case of $46,000 estimated by Kniesner and Sullivan (2020).<p>The Kniesner and Sullivan paper cited [2] gets to the value of $46,000 by using the Department of Transportation&#x27;s &quot;value per statistical life&quot; of about $10 million per death (scaled down to ~$11k per asymptomatic case), which is not a public health cost estimate. It&#x27;s probably far higher than what hospitals and the health system spends per case.<p>Not only that, but the paper claims, without any controls, that ALL case count increases in counties that sent lots of people to the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally in the weeks following it were caused by the Rally itself.

But, for example, he now doesn&#x27;t have the free time I have to do open source.... and neither will I if I work longer hours to cover for him ;-)"],"time":["2020-09-09 03:19:08"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["analog31"],"id":[24412835],"kids":[24413624,24414729],"parent":[24393178],"text":["Come to the Midwest. Here&#x27;s how we do it. First of all, you can&#x27;t retire at 30 on an entry level engineer salary (poetic license taken). Second, there are no child care benefits.<p>Instead, parents with kids split things up. One parent (usually the one who was earning less anyway) dials down their career, perhaps by going part time. The other parent dials up, by competing for promotions. For instance, it&#x27;s almost like clockwork that someone announces the birth of their first child, and shortly after that, they&#x27;ve become a project- or middle-manager, or they&#x27;ve gone to work somewhere else. A few years later, when their family life stabilizes, they might come back to engineering. That&#x27;s what I did.<p>This is a known economic effect. More than half of workers will change jobs for higher pay shortly after their first kid is born. There was a study of unskilled single women in a poor neighborhood in Chicago. After adjusting for everything else, the ones with kids tended to work for higher pay, changed jobs more often, and worked further from home.<p>This is all pre-COVID of course, but is how things have worked for decades.<p>Is this a good thing? Well, it stratifies the career ladder quite noticeably. How do you make it so that people with kids aren&#x27;t running the entire show? Likewise for society as a whole?<p>In my view, employer based child care benefits make about as much sense as employer based health care benefits."],"time":["2020-09-08 22:23:47"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["getpost"],"id":[24413965],"kids":{},"parent":[24393178],"text":["There is a fairness problem, and I don&#x27;t see a solution except to allow everyone to work less.

People are upset that those with children are given more schedule flexibility than those who do not have children. It seems like straight up jealousy. Instead of resenting parents, resent your manager and ask for ( or demand) what you want.<p>The argument that other workers need to make up for the slack left by parents does not really make sense; you just add tasks to your backlog, and do them when you have time. You should be in control of your own schedule, and don&#x27;t let your manager just extend your workday. If your manager does not respect your time and is overworking you, quit. As engineers, we are not punching a time clock. If you are, take issue with that, not the flexibility some other coworkers are getting (flexibility that they need).<p>If you also want more schedule flexibility, push for it. Talk to your manager. Organize with your fellow employees. Organize with other engineers. Start a union (gasp!).<p>Work-life balance is always a balance. Our jobs should take note of what we do outside of work and how that affects our ability to work. We are people, not mindless, identical worker bees. Our life outside of work is most likely more important to us than our life at work.<p>Having children is very much unlike most other activities in that you cannot quit. You can quit a side hustle, you can quit a sport. But you can&#x27;t quit being a parent. So when a parent turns to their boss and says &quot;I need more flexibility&quot;, the manager has to give that flexibility or the worker is going to have to find a new job that does give that flexibility. Usually capitalism will extract as much time from a worker as possible, forcing the worker to give up many things in the name of work. It&#x27;s impossible to give up your child though, so obviously capitalism has to yield there. But with better labor organization, capitalism will yield to other things too.<p>If we all want schedule flexibility and more time so badly, let&#x27;s unionize and get that. Not resent our working parents, who most likely have more on their plate and less free time than non-parents, even with the flexibility."],"time":["2020-09-09 20:47:20"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["TeeMassive"],"id":[24416509],"kids":{},"parent":[24393178],"text":["I&#x27;m going to be the devil&#x27;s advocate here.

Here is my take:<p>Ad platforms work in varying degrees for different products and companies. You should not dismiss an ad platform based on poor performance alone without understanding why it performed poorly.<p>It&#x27;s sort of like with airlines: If you boycott an airline for every minor offense, pretty soon you&#x27;ll have no option but to take the train.<p>In this case, it&#x27;s disingenuous to paint an entire ad platform--that does hundreds of millions in revenue[1]--as &quot;awash in mistaken clicks and bot traffic&quot; based on a campaign that ran for just 1.5 days and resulted in 11 clicks. (They say they saw similar results from larger campaigns, but they don&#x27;t show them.)<p>But Ok, let&#x27;s say we take out the generalizations. I get that it&#x27;s disconcerting for any company to find they were charged for traffic that bounced within a second. In that case you need to look for the root cause, and see if it can be resolved or worked around.<p>In this case the root cause should be painfully obvious to experienced marketers like the authors: Most of the 11 clicks seems to be from mobile traffic (as seen in their Fullstory report), where it is remarkably easy for users to accidentally click on an ad in their news feed. They do mention this possibility in both the video and the title, but they seem to underestimate the likelihood of this being the root cause, and talk too much about bots instead. I&#x27;ve seen this exact misclick behavior in Twitter and for that reason I stopped advertising there.<p>Unlike Twitter, however, LinkedIn lets you work around this. They offer a &quot;lead gen&quot; campaign type, which requires two clicks (one on the ad, and one more on the &quot;submit form&quot; button) and sharing of contact information before the advertiser is charged. I&#x27;ve still seen funky results from this--such as users saying they don&#x27;t recall submitting any form--but in much fewer cases than with simple image ads.<p>Today, when I run LinkedIn campaigns, it is almost always with lead gen ads. The results are <i>far<\/i> better than this anecdotal post suggests. Some issues still come up, and I&#x27;ve found that attempting to troubleshoot them leads to a better outcome for the business than dismissing the entire ad platform.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gkogan.co&#x2F;blog&#x2F;how-ad-campaigns-fail&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gkogan.co&#x2F;blog&#x2F;how-ad-campaigns-fail&#x2F;<\/a>\n[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.businessofapps.com&#x2F;data&#x2F;linkedin-statistics&#x2F;#3\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.businessofapps.com&#x2F;data&#x2F;linkedin-statistics&#x2F;#3<\/a>"],"time":["2020-09-08 16:28:36"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["josefrichter"],"id":[24408113],"kids":[24408723,24408287,24409204,24408452,24416996,24413129,24410669],"parent":[24407432],"text":["LinkedIn is the weirdest product ever.
