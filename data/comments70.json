It&#x27;s about one-offs. You are not hiring them for a year, in which time they will do an indeterminate number of pieces of work. That is what an employee with a salary is for. You are hiring them to do a particular piece of work. That is why you <i>pay them<\/i> per piece of work. So to me, the simplest (and only) test should be: &quot;are you paying them per piece of work?&quot;. If yes, contractor. If no, employee.<p>I can&#x27;t think of any occupation where the &quot;employee&quot; is getting paid on a per-task basis (rides in this case) and I would consider them an employee.<p>If I hire someone to write blog posts for me, and I pay them per blog post, they&#x27;re a contractor. The employee version is someone I pay a set salary to based on their skillset, and then they output some <i>indeterminate<\/i> amount of work.<p>If I hire someone to watch my kids for me, and I pay them per time they watch my kids, they&#x27;re a contractor, not an employee. The employee version is a nanny who lives in my home.<p>If someone is getting paid each time they perform a ride (and not otherwise), they&#x27;re a contractor. An employee is someone that you are paying even when they&#x27;re not driving.<p>I don&#x27;t think &quot;setting prices&quot;, &quot;choosing which hours&quot;, etc. has anything to do with it.<p>If I hire someone to write a blog post for me this morning and tell them I need it by lunch time, I&#x27;m not giving them a choice of when they want to work – they need to do it now.

Both Lyft and Uber have appealed the order, and the trial court stayed the injunction for ten days to allow them to seek relief in this court. Lyft (in case No. A160701) and Uber (in case No. A160706) have each petitioned this court for a writ of supersedeas. The People have filed an opposition to the petitions. The petitions for writ of supersedeas are hereby consolidated for purposes of decision. The petitions are granted and the preliminary injunction is stayed pending resolution of Lyft and Uber&#x27;s appeals, subject to the condition that, by 5:00 p.m. on August 25, 2020, Lyft and Uber shall both file written consents to the expedited procedures specified herein. If Lyft and Uber do not both file such written consents, the stay shall expire at 5:00 p.m. on August 25, 2020.<p>The procedures are as follows:<p>1. Lyft&#x27;s and Uber&#x27;s appeals shall be consolidated. Lyft and Uber may file separate briefs or combined briefs as they prefer.<p>2. Lyft and Uber shall proceed with an appendix in lieu of a clerk?s transcript on appeal. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.124.) They shall cooperate to prepare and file a single combined appellants&#x27; appendix, rather than separate appendices, which they shall file no later than the date they file their opening briefs. The appendix shall include a full copy of the index at the beginning of each appendix volume, and the digital copy of the appendix shall include pdf bookmark tabs for each entry on the index.<p>3. Briefing shall proceed on the following schedule. The appellants&#x27; opening briefs shall be filed no later than September 4, 2020. The respondent&#x27;s brief shall be filed no later than September 18, 2020. The reply briefs, if any, shall be filed no later than September 25, 2020. Absent unforeseen extraordinary circumstances, there shall be no extensions. Oral argument shall be scheduled for October 13, 2020.<p>4. On or before September 4, 2020, each defendant shall submit a sworn statement from its chief executive officer confirming that it has developed implementation plans under which, if this court affirms the preliminary injunction and Proposition 22 on the November 2020 ballot fails to pass, the company will be prepared to comply with the preliminary injunction within no more than 30 days after issuance of the remittitur in the appeal.<p>5. Should Lyft or Uber fail to comply with these procedures, the People may apply to this court to vacate this stay. Unless otherwise ordered, the stay will dissolve upon issuance of the remittitur in the appeal. (Cal.

It was with Goldman. Accidentally, went long something like 10,000 shares of AMGN at the time. I remember it was an Amgen &#x2F; Biogen pairs trade. Clearly it was an &#x27;out trade&#x27; or mistake. I called Goldman&#x27;s desk immediately (the trading was of course all automated). Anyway, I talk to a Goldman trader. He looks up the order. Again, I&#x27;m long a lot more AMGN than I should&#x27;ve been and it&#x27;s very unusual. Back then you could call trading desks - not sure how automated it is now... If there was an accident involved, the fair thing to do is to &quot;bust the trades&quot; (originally based on trading floors, trading pits, etc.). And lots of trading firms had these relationships with brokers like Goldman back in the day. AMGN is trading up a bit from when these orders came in - so I&#x27;m actually making a little money off this mistake, but I just want to unwind &#x2F; exit this mistake. He agrees. I breath a sigh of relief.<p>I go back to trying to figure out what stupid infinite loop triggered this issue and make sure I&#x27;m completely out of everything (note, this was a huge learning lesson in my programming career in terms of always building in safety checks). 30 minutes go by and the trades aren&#x27;t busted. I call Goldman back and now am worried, as by this time Amgen stock has started to go down, so now these trades are really hurting more and more (20k, 30k, etc. in 2005 dollars for a young programmer&#x2F;trader). Now it&#x27;s in Goldman&#x27;s favor and I speak to another guy and they refuse to bust the trades.<p>Why do I mention this? Because again it&#x27;s all a matter of churn. They made implicitly the calculation of - is this going to jeopardize the trading activity our firm is giving Goldman and cause us to split up? If not, if the expected cost of churn is less than they can make via a short-term reward, they don&#x27;t care.<p>I now work for Amazon, and I recall Bezos saying he&#x27;d always be happy to make up a loss for a customer instead of losing them as a customer. While I think this is a good thing in the world, in a way it all comes down to churn (and LTV). And the true price of your reputation for future customers based on your reputation for treating customers.<p>Brigade Capital has to make that call. For me, Goldman as a company is doing fine (despite my never trusting them again after that) - so perhaps it was the right call for them to make (re: their culture -- certainly, an argument can be made that they&#x27;re not liable; however the other argument that they agreed verbally to the bust and then went back on their word...).<p>I&#x27;ve since left the trading industry, and strongly believe in long-term value &#x2F; valuing the relationship with the customer above all and, economically, the LTV of a customer. But I&#x27;m savvy enough to know that indeed an Amazon LTV is way way more than a single cost of an item. Now Amazon can&#x27;t refund every single order that is lapsed or it will really start to eat up LTV, but it makes a lot of economic sense to protect the customer relationship (it&#x27;s not just being nice).<p>But there&#x27;s always a tradeoff. Is 176.2 million worth it v. the reputation hit and increase in churn rate for existing customers + the lowered expectation of new customers? Perhaps for them it is. (Are they a 1B under management company? a 100B under management company?

For example, if you want to go from B to C, and there is a medium-distance bus covering B-C route, and one covering A-B-C-D route, the latter cannot accept you (you could also think of this as a mandatory gentleman&#x27;s agreement).

New space-based capabilities will be central to how militaries command and control their forces. Even more than today, future kill chains will flow through space, enabling militaries to distribute the process of understanding, deciding, and acting across large networks of systems rather than depending on single platforms to close the kill chain on their own. The result will be a dramatic expansion of &quot;time-sensitive targeting&quot;: the ability to find moving targets, track them, and strike them before they have moved away.<p>The proliferation of satellites, however, is only the beginning of the new space race. Spacecraft have always been limited by the impracticality of refueling them. They have only as much fuel as they could carry into space, and when it is gone, they cannot actively propel themselves any farther. This has restricted spacecraft to orbiting Earth, but emerging space technologies are changing that.<p>These technologies are being developed now. In the coming years, it will be possible to service, assemble, and manufacture complex orbital infrastructure in space that would be impractical to launch from Earth. This could include vast space-based solar power arrays to capture more of the sun&#x27;s energy than is possible on Earth, where our atmosphere absorbs or deflects it. Power-beaming technologies will transfer that energy around space. Space-based mining technologies could extract ice from the moon or asteroids, utilizing the underlying oxygen to fuel rockets and support human life in space. The means of production to support space operations will increasingly shift off Earth and into orbital bases and perhaps onto the moon, where spacecraft and other critical space infrastructure could be produced using 3-D printing and advanced manufacturing. It sounds like fantasy, but it is not.<p>In time, space will be transformed into a unique warfighting domain, and this will inevitably have military applications. Space operations in the coming decades will come to resemble maritime operations in the nineteenth century, when industrial age great powers built global networks of coaling stations and other infrastructure to project naval power in defense of their expanding commercial interests. A similar dynamic will occur in outer space, and the two states that will most shape humankind&#x27;s spacefaring future will be China and the United States. It is hard to imagine their strategic and military competition will remain confined to Earth.<p>Source: The Kill Chain, Defending America in the future of high-tech warfare, Christian Brose, Hachette Books, 2020."],"time":["2020-08-20 19:22:33"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ackbar03"],"id":[24226004],"kids":[24226623,24229151,24226408],"parent":[24224199],"text":["Does anybody have any ideas as to what opportunities might open up for lightweight start ups from the general trend of decreasing launch costs?

The scenario in the Docker image is I believe the exact one that this is intended to provide sanity for, since you have two Pythons in play— the Debian-packaged python and also the built-from-source Python. Things get hairy once you start using the pip from either of these pythons to start installing pypi packages, especially if those packages or their dependencies have compiled parts which may not work for the other Python. Anyone who has used a Mac with brewed Python has also likely experienced this pain— especially in the days before wheels, where you basically had to use brewed Python for scientific work unless you wanted to compile big packages like numpy from source.<p>So the deal is that the system-supplied Python can get deps from apt packages, or from pip (into ~&#x2F;.local, or as root into &#x2F;usr&#x2F;local), but either way will install them into a dist-packages directory. This keeps them separate from the packages which the built-from-source Python installs into site-packages.<p>Upstream Python has put a bunch of pieces in place to address this natively, for example with the &quot;magic&quot; tags that keep compiled assets separate in a directory of packages being potentially used by multiple different interpreters (see <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.python.org&#x2F;dev&#x2F;peps&#x2F;pep-3147&#x2F;#proposal\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.python.org&#x2F;dev&#x2F;peps&#x2F;pep-3147&#x2F;#proposal<\/a>).

I mean, it&#x27;s not a PhD thesis or anything, but there&#x27;s some insights worth pondering, tucked away in this article.<p>The gist is here:<p><i>Now, we are approaching a new barrier — ideas that require not just extreme depth in one field, but depth in two or sometimes even more fields simultaneously.<\/i><p><i>Take synethtic biology and the future of pharmaceuticals. There is a popular and now well-funded thesis on crossing machine learning and biology&#x2F;medicine together to create the next generation of pharma and clinical treatment. The datasets are there, the patients are ready to buy, and the old ways of discovering new candidates to treat diseases look positively ancient against a more deliberate and automated approach afforded by modern algorithms.<\/i><p><i>Moving the needle even slightly here though requires enormous knowledge of two very hard and disparate fields. AI and bio are domains that get extremely complex extremely fast, and also where researchers and founders quickly reach the frontiers of knowledge.<\/i><p>I would agree with that sentiment in the general sense. And there&#x27;s probably some interesting things to be gained by thinking deeply about how to address that problem.<p>The only part of this I found myself disagreeing with somewhat is here:<p><i>We’ve gone through the generation of startups you can do as a dropout from high school or college, hacking a social network out of PHP scripts or assembling a computer out of parts at a local homebrew club. We’ve also gone through the startups that required a PhD in electrical engineering, or biology, or any of the other science and engineering fields that are the wellspring for innovation.<\/i><p>While I agree that it&#x27;s probably getting <i>harder<\/i> to come up with something really innovative without that &quot;fusion&quot; approach alluded to above, I&#x27;m not convinced that it&#x27;s not possible. Furthermore, I don&#x27;t see being &quot;the next no code startup&quot; or &quot;the next cryptocurrency startup&quot; as being a Bad Thing - so long as you do it in a way that&#x27;s appreciably better than &quot;the other folks&quot; doing the same thing.<p>Sure, inventing something Brand New is nice, but you can make money making a &quot;nicer version of something that already exists&quot;, or by just innovating on business model while the product is unchanged (or mostly so)."],"time":["2020-08-19 22:13:29"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["hogFeast"],"id":[24218751],"kids":{},"parent":[24208828],"text":["If you are in SV, it can seem like the world is moving very fast (and within SV, the number of things that people are trying and call &quot;technology&quot; is much larger than the number of things that people outside SV either want or need).

Which is definitely high, though primarily for those who sell externally licensed and&#x2F;or non-digital goods.<p>But to me (with my almost decade long iOS developer experience), the bigger problems are:<p>* You cannot install apps on an iPhone (even on a phone that you own) without paying Apple. Without a developer account, an app that you build and self sign works for only 7 days.<p>* If you are an app that exists on other platforms, and&#x2F;or accepts payments on other platforms, you can&#x27;t describe that or even link to it, from your iOS app. Your users need to know that the alternative options exist on their own. See the Netflix sign in screen for a nice example, but realize that 99% of apps won&#x27;t get away with that, only apps the size of Netflix can.<p>* You can only ship apps that Apple&#x27;s inconsistent review board agrees with. And of course, the rules and their inconsistent application keep changing in favor of Apple&#x27;s competing apps, which of course have access to internal APIs and don&#x27;t pay a 30% cut either. Spotify is a good example here, but it&#x27;s worse for many smaller companies.<p>* And now macOS is adopting the worst of iOS&#x27; draconian policies. You won&#x27;t be able to run non-notarized apps on macOS on Apple Silicon based computers at all.<p>Unfortunately there are many who drink the Apple koolaid about all of this being all about security. There are legitimately good things that Apple does which enhance user security, and I welcome changes like the new IDFA policy of iOS 14, but let&#x27;s not pretend that Apple does those because they affect Apple&#x27;s competitors&#x27; business and strengthen Apple&#x27;s (you have to now use Apple&#x27;s sdk for user tracking).<p>But none of the things I wrote about above are about the user, and some of them are actively worse for Apple&#x27;s users  (eg: not being able to buy a book on the Kindle app easily)."],"time":["2020-08-20 18:27:29"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["nostrademons"],"id":[24223746],"kids":[24224518,24223982,24225466,24224600,24223822,24230656,24226241,24228586],"parent":[24222808],"text":["I&#x27;d bet that their end goal is to get them broken up, and have the app store separated from the product.

If you read the copy on the current intermix.io website, I think you&#x27;ll find yourself nodding.

I think the per-seat model is the way to go. We tried charging by number of rows, and size of the warehouse (number of nodes), but then you run into weird situations with customers who are dealing with huge historic datasets, but really only look at the last 30 of data.<p>My unsolicited $0.02 is that you think hard about distribution.

Through their Vulnerability Reporting Program, we were able to report the issues we found to MediaTek and work with them to make sure these issues get patched for your safety.<p>&gt; What Happened?<p>&gt; This is a story about two bugs we found in the last few months.<p>&gt; The first bug (CVE-2017-05591) was an overly permissive domain validation in the bootloader. The bootloader allows the modem to be updated without flashing the complete firmware. The validation is done using the bootloader code running in the processor of the phone. This allowed us to inject our own bootloader code into the program running on the processor and bypass the authentication of the modem. The modem is responsible for communication with the network. In other words, by bypassing the authentication of the modem we can control the phone communication channels.<p>&gt; The second bug (CVE-2017-95881) is a buffer overflow in a very special program called TrustZone. The TrustZone is a security processor in most of the recent phones. It runs a separate operating system in which the kernel is trusted to be free of any malicious code, and has access to the memory, CPU and devices. The TrustZone kernel code runs outside the control of any other code. This bug in the TrustZone code allowed us to replace it with a custom one we designed, without any permissions.<p>&gt; We wrote a special TrustZone kernel code that allows us to gain full control over the phone. It allowed us to bypass all the phone security restrictions. With this custom TrustZone kernel code running, we were able to read the encrypted messages sent by any application. In addition, we also got full control over the device.<p>But finally the AI lost the context, and the topic shifted from insecure to security, and eventually the writing becomes a new marketing advertisement on a secure smartphone, which I&#x27;ve removed in the quote."],"time":["2020-08-21 04:16:35"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[24231272],"kids":{},"parent":[24225685],"text":{},"time":["2020-08-21 04:13:22"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":[true]},{"by":{},"id":[24230959],"kids":{},"parent":[24225685],"text":{},"time":["2020-08-21 03:21:24"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":[true]},{"by":{},"id":[24230844],"kids":{},"parent":[24225685],"text":{},"time":["2020-08-21 03:04:18"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":[true]},{"by":["tomc1985"],"id":[24229112],"kids":{},"parent":[24225685],"text":["Every time I see GPT-3 I gsub &quot;Fancypants Markov Chains&quot; and the story always becomes a lot more breathless"],"time":["2020-08-20 23:18:54"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["KMag"],"id":[24222684],"kids":[24224647],"parent":[24208663],"text":["This article starts out talking about Linux address space layout.

Really, all you need to do is write an interpreter.<p>A standard interpreters for a language (like Python) evaluates the language to produce some value. If you want to do static analysis, make the values the property you are analyzing. In this blog post&#x27;s example the value is a boolean denoting whether a file is a test file or not. Thus an interpreter would be recursive on individual AST nodes, doing the decisions shown here in the sample and returning the expected value from the analysis. This forms the core of a rich literature in abstract interpretation, where the program analyzer instead of producing the concrete results of evaluating a program produces a the value of a property that you want to analyze.<p>Even compilers are interpreters. Instead of writing ad-hoc methods that do some operations, compilers can often be structured as something that evaluates the a program in source language and instead of producing a value, produces another program in a different language.<p>Interpreters are underrated!<p>Edit: typos"],"time":["2020-08-20 16:50:16"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["vii"],"id":[24228241],"kids":{},"parent":[24222186],"text":["py.test has a different way of finding tests.

There&#x27;s also the principle that false, misleading, or distracting information is <i>worse<\/i> than no information, and should be rejected as rapidly and cheaply (with minimum effort, burden, or deliberation) as possible.<p>Given that prediction is hard, especially about the future, <i>errors will occur<\/i>.  A critical question is <i>how does the source address this?<\/i><p>In the case of one cited example, Paul Krugman, he frequently admits errors, even significant ones.  I&#x27;d noted some years ago his <i>mea culpa<\/i> regarding his 1970s outlook on energy.[1]  This is only one of numerous instances, some large, some small.[2]  Krugman also offers his advice on how to regard errors in predictions:<p><i>My view, however, is that you don’t just want to look at whether people have been wrong; you want to ask how they respond when events don’t go the way they predicted.<\/i>[3]<p>And he states his own principles on the matter <i>along with numerous examples of his own errors<\/i>, contrasting with others who are &quot;completely unwilling to admit mistakes&quot;:<p><i>I try hard not to behave that way. If I make a mistake — like my extreme pessimism about the short-term survival of the euro, or my warnings back in 2003 about a US debt crisis — I do try to admit it, and figure out where I was wrong (I underestimated both Europe’s political cohesion and the extent to which ECB intervention could short-circuit the financial panic; back when, I made a false analogy with countries that borrow in someone else’s currency.) No doubt there have been times when I rewrote history to make myself look better, but I try to avoid that — it’s a major intellectual and moral sin.<\/i>[4]<p>That&#x27;s not to say Krugman practices this perfectly, and <i>by his own admission<\/i> he allows exceptions, though he seems to give the notion an earnest effort and be self-aware.  This contrasts with numerous others, including several of recent conversations I&#x27;ve seen on HN in which refutation after refutation draws nary a note of acknowledgement. Makes for tedious discussion.<p><i>If<\/i> prediction is a speculative venture,[5] <i>then<\/i> errors will be made.  Failure to be wrong is failure to try:  &quot;predictions&quot; are simply obvious statements, tautologies, unfalsifiable, or cold readings which will be interpreted as accurate regardless of future outcomes.  Occasionally they&#x27;re made by an entity which has the sole power to determine outcome, whether by controlling events (discretion of action) or judgement (&quot;It&#x27;s not who votes that counts, but who counts the votes,&quot; as Stalin is claimed to have said).  See also rigged courts and selection committees.<p>Which affords another principle:  be wary those who determine both decisions <i>and<\/i> the assessment of outcomes.  A recent exchange on HN saw the claim that the US Federal Reserve had changed its definition of inflation.  A response correctly noted that whilst the Fed&#x27;s Dual Mandate is to <i>manage<\/i> both inflation and unemployment, both are <i>measured<\/i> by a different entity:  the U.S. Department of Labour.<p>Rather than penalise error, we should instead <i>look to its causes and responses<\/i>.  Is the source <i>systematically biased<\/i>?  Was there <i>poor data<\/i>?  Was <i>analysis<\/i> flawed?  Did the source simply have a <i>bad model<\/i> or <i>poor conceptual grasp<\/i>, arguably the case for Krugman&#x27;s Internet blunder.  Or were they simply careless, and the prediction itself a trivial non-serious cherry-picked element of their work?  That&#x27;s Krugman&#x27;s own admission along with, again, his admission of error:<p><i>I must have tossed it off quickly (at the time I was mainly focused on the Asian financial crisis!), then later conflated it in my memory with the NYT piece. Anyway, I was clearly trying to be provocative, and got it wrong, which happens to all of us sometimes.<\/i>[6]<p>Worse than those who ignore or fail to  correct errors are those who become defensive, engage in projection, invoke  <i>tu quoque<\/i> and whatabboutism, who become hostile and abusive, who deny, and&#x2F;or hide their past, often through secrecy classifications, assertions of privilage, NDAs, nondisparagement contracts, gag orders, outright threats, or unhealthful tea.<p>There&#x27;s one worse level yet:  Those who are openly and flagrantly indifferent to the truth.<p>Such actors are very nearly always dangerous of themselves, whether through presumed or actual immunity or impunity.  The dynamic is well-described in Adam Curtis&#x27;s documentary <i>HyperNormalisation<\/i>.[7]<p>Any circumstance in which factual statements are rewarded for anything <i>other<\/i> than truth valence is ultimately perversely selecting.  This may be punishing bad news, favouring good, or rewarding (usually short-term)  profit (or audience) over truth value.  This last makes any advertising-supported medium inherently suspect.<p>There are four fallacies associated with smart people being stupid:<p>- Egocentrism: overly self-centered, stop caring about outcomes for others.<p>- Omniscience: surround themselves with sycophants.<p>- Omnipotence: believe they can do anything.<p>- Invulnerability: believe they can get away with anything.<p>There&#x27;s a large literature on truth detection.

Except that it&#x27;s not even wrong.<p>To give just one example, rates of alcoholism are higher in South India - both in TN and Kerala [1] - where endemic poverty of the Madhya Pradesh kind doesn&#x27;t exist.<p>We can agree that addiction is widespread and there&#x27;s been a world wide shift in the spending habits of people who earn less than a dollar a day. Banerjee&#x2F;Duflo&#x27;s Nobel Prize is based on that work [2]. Some relevant quotes:<p>&gt; Yet the average person living at under $1 per day does not seem to put every available penny into buying more calories. Among our 13 countries, food typically represents from 56 to 78 percent of consumption among rural households, and 56 to 74 percent in urban areas. For the rural poor in Mexico, slightly less than half the budget (49.6 percent) is allocated to food.2<p>&gt; Of course, these people could be spending the rest of their money on other commodities they greatly need. Yet among the nonfood items that the poor spend significant amounts of money on, alcohol and tobacco show up prominently. The extremely poor in rural areas spent 4.1 percent of their budget on tobacco and alcohol in Papua New Guinea; 5.0 percent in Udaipur, India; 6.0 percent in Indonesia; and 8.1 percent in Mexico.<p>&gt; Perhaps more surprisingly, spending on festivals is an important part of the budget for many extremely poor households. In Udaipur, over the course of the previous year, more than 99 percent of the extremely poor households spent money on a wedding, a funeral, or a religious festival. The median household spent 10 percent of its annual budget on festivals.<p>5% is a lot on alcohol, but cannot be the major cause of poverty, festivals being an even bigger outlay. We also know that in India those spending habits are gendered, which is why prohibition campaigns have been very popular among women voters.<p>Nevertheless, the idea that the poor are poor because of their &#x27;poor values&#x27; is one of the oldest tropes in the book.

A secure system with a switch to turn off the security might work for Linux and a highly technical user, but when you’ve given smartphones to a few billion people, a secure system with a switch to turn off the security is just a target for malware.<p>One of the things I found very frustrating about this article is that it fails to remember the actual history: when the iPhone first came out, jailbreaks were plentiful and powerful... the iPhone tried to be a closed and locked down platform, <i>but failed<\/i> due to the almost continual existence of serious security flaws that allowed for 0-day drops of exploits with almost every new device release (which coincided with every new major iOS release).<p>This means that we can actually look back at the history of the iPhone and answer the question &quot;could the iPhone have been as successful as it was if there had been a switch that allowed users to opt out of Apple&#x27;s complete control of not only whose apps could be installed, but further what <i>kind<\/i> of software could be installed (to let you install things like daemons or extensions to existing apps)&quot; and the answer is &quot;apparently, it could, because it did&quot;.<p>In fact, it is the opposite question that we <i>can&#x27;t<\/i> easily answer: &quot;would the iPhone have been as successful as it was <i>without<\/i> the ability to opt out of Apple&#x27;s closed ecosystem?&quot;... and this is a question where the answer is not at all obvious: for many many years the iPhone very poorly satisfied the needs of users in many countries, and jailbreaking filled the gap. Apple didn&#x27;t get around to having a good Chinese keyboard until iOS 5 or 6 or so, and so Baidu maintained one and seriously encouraged users of their search engine to jailbreak from their landing page. Meanwhile, the feature set was in some real sense anemic, and jailbreaking also filled <i>that<\/i> gap: as a trivial example, Steve Jobs seemed very anti-wallpaper, a feature which didn&#x27;t appear until iOS 4... the number of people who jailbroke just to install wallpaper was incredible ;P.<p>And honestly, I think Apple sort of knew that: I had always gotten the distinct impression that they considered the bugs used by people who jailbroke to be pretty low priority, and they would sometimes remain unfixed for months on end. At some point, the iPhone started to get &quot;good enough&quot; by default, and it was only then that Apple really started to turn down the screws, deciding to fix bugs quickly and even hire jailbreakers who never believed in the cause--those who were willing to play the game as a mercenary for hire--to defend the platform instead of being on the offensive. Today, jailbreaking thereby feels like a niche ecosystem, but it <i>mattered<\/i> for at least half the history of the iPhone, with something like 12% of users being jailbroken (it would quickly fall a bit on new firmware releases and then rise back up).<p>The reality is that <i>innovation<\/i> happens on platforms because of the ability for people to make modifications and enhancements without having to wait for the platform vendor: if iOS had succeeded in truly being a closed ecosystem, Baidu would not have been able to build custom keyboards to support Chinese users as Apple didn&#x27;t get around to supporting third-party custom keyboards until iOS 8. Open platforms thereby get new features faster and can support the needs of many more users from any number of market subsets. Yes: it is the case that a closed system can sort of try to satisfy the needs of at least most people, but you don&#x27;t get there overnight, and even coming up with sane extensibility hooks takes time. The real experiment has thus only recently begun: can a platform where only a single company can decide how to deploy new features continue to maintain its relevance going forward?"],"time":["2020-08-20 18:48:04"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["tonywastaken"],"id":[24228092],"kids":[24228201],"parent":[24208704],"text":["Why don&#x27;t disgruntled app developers just pull their apps from the app stores?
