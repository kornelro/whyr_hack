They can do this long term, continuously increasing scale, without bank runs. Quantity is a quality of its own. If banks expand mortgage lending, real estate will inflate... either with higher prices or with more building. This isn&#x27;t money that was redirected from one sector to another.

This lets everyone (compatibly) name their functions&#x2F;variables whatever they want.<p>Less intuitively, it also basically removes the need for builds. Every function has a verifiable unique identity, so your compiler can tell with 100% certainty whether or not something needs to be rebuilt. When you modify a function, it changes the hash, so you end up with both the old and the new function.

In the future it might be another way.<p>So I really feel it&#x27;s not accurate to say there&#x27;s some &quot;problem&quot; with people on Earth creating languages that are founded in Chinese, or Japanese, or Italian, or Russian, or Hindi, or any of the many other languages people speak. For a large corner (or even a small corner) of the world, it would not be a &quot;problem&quot;, it would be perfectly natural.<p>I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that accurate, or that useful, to think of programming and English as being somehow a natural match.<p>When people speak about &quot;representation&quot; in the &quot;tech industry&quot; they ought to consider this factor as well. I&#x27;m not just talking about SV, I mean &quot;global representation in engineering&quot;. Of course, if Japanese people decide to embrace a language that somehow uses Japanese letters or characters then, there&#x27;s probably not much you can do about it.<p>I&#x27;m just saying, don&#x27;t assume it&#x27;s a bad thing and don&#x27;t think somehow English and programming has to go together. Certainly at the level of logic, and CS, programming is completely independent of English (tho interesting to think about how the grammar of English maybe constrained and drove initial language structures, concepts and flow control and do a comparative study of differences to languages that emerged from cultures and used other human languages.)"],"time":["2020-08-31 13:35:54"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["amitport"],"id":[24328591],"kids":[24328740,24329881,24328684,24332679,24328710,24328686,24328610,24332307,24329939,24332553],"parent":[24328071],"text":["I may be wrong, but I don&#x27;t think this is what people mean by &#x27;sum types&#x27;.<p>I was expecting union types (e.g., <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.typescriptlang.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;handbook&#x2F;unions-and-intersections.html#union-types\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.typescriptlang.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;handbook&#x2F;unions-and-inte...<\/a> or <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dotty.epfl.ch&#x2F;docs&#x2F;reference&#x2F;new-types&#x2F;union-types.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dotty.epfl.ch&#x2F;docs&#x2F;reference&#x2F;new-types&#x2F;union-types.h...<\/a> )<p>I guess enums are a type of sum type, but seems this is more specifically about enums"],"time":["2020-08-31 06:50:17"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["siraben"],"id":[24328703],"kids":[24339238,24328756],"parent":[24328071],"text":["When I think of sum types, I like the categorical definition the best, which is that a sum A+B has two morphisms (i.e. constructors) Inl : A -&gt; A+B and Inr : B -&gt; A+B, with a simple commuting diagram[0].

Emphasize synchronization over imperative API calls. <i>Imperative APIs encourage data silos.<\/i> They are the underlying technical part of the problem that Zapier and ITTT try to solve. See [0] and [1] for some ideas.<p>2. Allow users to submit &quot;agents&quot; rather than &quot;requests.&quot; An agent is a small program given extremely limited resources (limited process&#x2F;memory&#x2F;runtime budget) that you can safely run on your server. It is a possible answer to many of the standards&#x2F;protocols that wouldn&#x27;t exist if frontends were running on the same machines as backends. [2]<p>3. Emphasize composition over integration. Functions compose (nest, recurse). Event emitters don&#x27;t. As long as APIs are built to be integrated rather than composed, making them work together is a full-time or full-company job (eg. Zapier).<p>4. Make things immutable. Immutability allows APIs to &quot;play&quot; with one another without fear of setting off the nukes (ie. side effects). It&#x27;s possible that this approach would make it so that integrating two APIs becomes a job for ML&#x2F;AI rather than humans.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;braid-work&#x2F;braid-spec\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;braid-work&#x2F;braid-spec<\/a><p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;writings.quilt.org&#x2F;2014&#x2F;05&#x2F;12&#x2F;distributed-systems-and-the-end-of-the-api&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;writings.quilt.org&#x2F;2014&#x2F;05&#x2F;12&#x2F;distributed-systems-an...<\/a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23900749\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23900749<\/a>"],"time":["2020-08-31 19:54:38"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jayd16"],"id":[24333402],"kids":[24334057,24338728],"parent":[24332418],"text":["Enjoyable read but not much here.

Your smartphone stays black while you swipe at it and press the various buttons. Has the battery gone flat? You could have sworn you left the house with a full charge. Now you start to wonder how you’ll get your car out of the parking structure without a working mobile. That thought hadn’t occurred to you before.\nIt’s the least of your worries.\nStill fussing with your smartphone, you gradually begin to realise you’re not the only one having this problem. In fact, it would seem that everyone waiting at the pick-up area is in various stages of agitation with their own smartphones. Some are pressing odd combinations of buttons, trying to reset the little beasties. Others, who have clearly had rough days now made worse, start to swear at their dead screens, as if cursing might shock them into life.\nIt’s weird, and almost a bit funny. For a brief moment.\nThe first smashing can be felt more than heard, a subsonic strike something like a vast drumhead being struck with a metre-wide mallet, but so quick, you barely even notice it until it’s over. The second one, however, isn’t far behind, and it’s a bit louder. That second thump gives away its location — whatever it was seems to be happening quite close by — in the direction of the parking structure.\nAt just this moment a car cruises through the pick-up zone at full speed, barreling along at least 100 kmh. It’s only because of some very fast reactions that no one gets hurt as it passes by. As it zooms past, you notice there’s no one behind the wheel.\nBefore you have any time to process that, another huge thump nearby causes a section of the barrier wall of an upper floor of the concrete parking structure to shear off.

Agree that this is a nascent but really interesting and important area for machine learning as a discipline.

This will be addressed by some of the highest performing teams, but I&#x27;d hazard a guess that there&#x27;s many models in production nowadays that aren&#x27;t instrumented to consider concepts like the extremes and dynamics of their valid input spaces, developer-introduced scope creep as models get more integrated with CI&#x2F;CD practices, and many other tricky and complex behaviours that might get lost amongst the noise of ML development.<p>&quot;Testing&quot; in ML as it stands just now is essentially still development &amp; application logic of the learned function, not testing in the same sense as we consider it in other aspects of software.

For example, a function may modify a list you pass in and also return it, when your chain assumed it would return a copy. A sort function may be unstable when the calling code assumed it was stable. A function may move to another thread when the calling code assumes that locking is unnecessary.<p>All of these would be easier to catch if the code were inline, instead of abstracted behind a function signature. Of course, this has to balance somehow with not rewriting sorting procedures in every function of your code base.<p>I think that the answer probably lies with some idea of separating library code and application code. Library code should be composed of many small functions, well documented and well unit-tested. Application programmers should all be familiar with the library and its semantics.

I can certainly conceive of it being easier to learn and debug a single long function than multiple smaller ones if one is unfamiliar with the codebase. I&#x27;d expect that effect to go away once one is asked to debug the same code again.<p>Second, the article asserts more bugs are found in shorter functions. However, this is only taking lines of code into account, not functional complexity. As code lives, bugs are found and corrected; often those bugs are to do with unforeseen runtime circumstances. Joel Spolsky covered this memorably a couple decades ago [1]. Again, taken as a static snapshot, I am not surprised that short code correlates with bugs, but I don&#x27;t think that tells us any meaningful information about how to code. A codebase is not a static entity.<p>As pointed out by several people already, the point of short functions is abstraction and comprehensibility - we want one and only one place to talk about reading a file, one and only one place to talk about handling a particular message type. Similarly, we want to know when we look at a function that it does one and only one thing, and we want to know when we look at our code that what it says it&#x27;s doing is what it&#x27;s actually doing.<p>I think this is one of those studies similar to the &quot;judges sentence harsher before lunch&quot;[2] study - the type of effect discussed fails under any reasonable comparison to commonly-experienced reality.

But when you use short functions, you try to abstract things and make these functions usable in general cases. Who thinks, that simply splitting up a long function with zero changes fixes any bugs? Hopefully very few people. The only advantage in that case would be, that one can think in the context of that smaller function about what it is doing and that might help to find a bug _and then fix it_ by changing the logic. By then we have done already more than simply splitting up the long function though.<p>Long functions usually do more than one thing to achieve a more complex thing, which requires doing multiple steps. That makes them less reusable. They become too specific in what they achieve. If ones naming skills (those are very important) are not up to the task of naming long functions precisely, then perhaps one will forget, that this long function does something very specific inside to reach its goal. It will silently have lost composability. Other developers for sure will not know, unless they read all the code. I have seen atrocious 300+ loc functions, which serve exactly one purpose and interact with so many parts of the system, that I can read them 10 times and still do not get what they do in their entirety.<p>By not using small functions, one gives away readability as well. Every function is a chance to give a name to some short program. Short functions can be looked at separately, if written well. Of course, if you modify a lot of global state in your short function then no one can help you any longer.<p>&gt; All of the studies measuring defect density found increased defect density for smaller functions. One possible explanation was suggested by [2], who proposed that the increase in errors was due to what they called “interface errors” – that is, “those that were associated with structures existing outside the module’s local environment but which the module used.” This would include errors such as calling the wrong function.<p>Well, that happens usually, when the naming is off or difficult to remember or follow. That is why naming things is an incredibly important skill. The name of a function should, if possible, give a good picture (by convention if there is any) of what the function is doing. Do not tell me, that the 100 loc function can be described in a single verb. It is most likely doing much more than one thing.<p>So in general I am not convinced by how the title and intro of the article put it. If we look at the article, the title is also actually different than here. It says &quot;Very short [...]&quot; not &quot;short&quot;.<p>They would have to limit the scope of their study a lot, to make a good point. For example:<p>(1) procedural code &#x2F; mainstream &quot;every noun is a class&quot; code &#x2F; functional code<p>(2) the kind of expertise of coding people allowed to take part (Was the code written by capable people?)<p>(3) the programming languages they look at<p>It seems that this research might be biased by what code they looked at. Some programming communities are not as well known for keeping code clean as others. They are often associated with &quot;only learned one programming language ever, never widened their horizon to a different methodology or paradigm&quot;. Those are mainly found in languages, which are very widely used and up at the top of the programming language usage lists like TIOBE. The reason is, that being at the top of the list is used by many as a justification to not needing to learn a different tool. Many people stop learning. Here I quote the article:<p>&gt; However, nowadays the vast majority of functions are under 50 lines. A quick analysis of Eclipse, a popular open source IDE, reveals it averages about 8.6 lines per method in its source code.<p>Relating to an IDE, which is mainly used for Java.<p>&gt; This shift in function sizes is perhaps partially due to changes in programming languages. In the 80s a Fortran “module” was commonly considered a function and some variables  (see eg. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tutorialspoint.com&#x2F;fortran&#x2F;fortran_modules.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tutorialspoint.com&#x2F;fortran&#x2F;fortran_modules.htm<\/a>) and function was the basic building block of software, whereas nowadays most Java or C++ programmers would define “module” as a class consisting of multiple functions.<p>They do that, because for a long time their languages were so limited, that they did not have any other means of expressing a module. This also discouraged a style which does not use objects, but only functions. Add to that, that Java (and I think neither C++) does not have TCO and you have yet another reason, why Java or C++ code is not a good argument, when talking about short functions. Java got modules now, as far as I know. Not sure developers make proper use of them.<p>I would like to see the same research being done on a language like Haskell or Scheme, one language at a time."],"time":["2020-08-29 12:52:21"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mikl"],"id":[24330837],"kids":[24330969,24330962,24336312,24336375,24330889,24338433,24332969,24331097,24331104,24335935,24335246],"parent":[24329485],"text":["From my understanding, to adopt Smalltalk, I’d have to give up my editor, my SCM, my code review practises, my deployment strategies, my whole way of working.

This error happens multiple times in the article.<p>&gt; While the current APIs work very well for their intended use cases, using those APIs in contexts where there is no clear start or end for an operation can be confusing or not possible.<p>I don’t understand this part. At Klarrio, we are using Jaeger to trace a multi-tenant microservice system. We ingest data over mqtt and forward to kafka. Contexts are created on ingest and forwarded via kafka to further services. Each service adds its own spans to the trace. A message can be sent from one tenant to another, we don’t know when the trace is completed as the tenant can add spans at any time in the future. There isn’t clear end to the process. Traces can span over days. We use it to report latencies in a real time environment to a governmental body.<p>&gt; whose event loops call into application code (inversion of control), we need complex workarounds in existing APIs that often break the abstractions provided by these libraries<p>I’d like to know more how a custom solution solves this problem. At the end of the day, the trace id and parent span id still has to be somehow forwarded to the next service.<p>* edit: there is an example of a curl query towards the end of the article. Jaeger has a built in reporter and it’s already possible to send a context over http to another service. It’s just data?<p>So it also has to somehow plug into the mentioned frameworks&#x2F;IoC? What’s different?<p>In worst case, this is a perfect example of where a contribution for opentracing support would be probably appreciated.<p>&gt; Further, we also found that in those use cases there may be multiple request flows (producer-consumer patterns via kafka, goroutines, streaming systems) happening at the same time or we may want to track a single event across multiple request flows. In either case, having a single tracer for the execution of the entire application can be a limiting factor.<p>It’s possible with Jaeger. We do this at Klarrio. Span context can be sent over the wire. Furthermore, one is not limited to a single tracer per application.<p>&gt; Raw spans are internal implementation details in tracing systems.<p>Yes, implementation detail.<p>&gt; These internal implementation details are hidden from users, who interact with these spans via an instrumentation API at creation time and via the trace UI at consumption time.<p>Consumption, how? In the UI? Yes, they are visible. Through an API? They’re in tags and logs fields. They’re definitely not hidden.<p>&gt; For example, I’d like to be able to ask a question like “Am I missing my SLA because of slow DB queries on a specific http endpoint?” Even though traces contain this information, users often have to write complex Java programs, a multi-day effort, to answer their questions. Without an easy way to ask powerful analytical questions, users have to settle for the insights that can be gleaned from the trace view. This drastically limits the ability to utilize trace data for triage.<p>Jaeger has pluggable storage back ends. One of them is kafka. With kafka, it’s one step to such a solution. Either store them in a database allowing for such query (presto, druid... hello?) or write a kafka app managing alerts. Why reinvent the wheel completely?<p>I’m not convinced but if it works for Slack, great.

STAMP, or at least STPA which is the related method you&#x27;d use in the design stage, doesn&#x27;t try to identify <i>all<\/i> hazards (STAMP has the benefit of being conducted with hindsight, so it is likely to identify more hazards). When used during design, you run <i>multiple<\/i> STPA analyses and may eventually identify all hazards, but there is no guarantee. Additionally, while you often have a singular STAMP instance (because it follows from an accident), STPA is run multiple times. There is no singular STPA analysis, but a collection of analyses.<p>Each analysis is performed on a model of the system which is, necessarily, a simplification. Some models will have details that others lack. This provides the team a better opportunity to focus on the hazards involved in that area.

May i tell you that  out of 100% of people or companies advertising investment, just like 2% can guarantee the outcome. The rest are mere scorn artists who just want to take your money. Thread with caution!<p>This is also a signal to all regulatory authorities to buckle up. You must know that if cryptocurrency is prohibited in your jurisdiction you do not have business with it. The reason being that when there is a problem or abuse, the investor lacks government protection.<p>If you sense that you are being defrauded by an investment company there are few steps listed below which could help you to recover them if you have all your proof of investment and conversation history. The following are the process:<p>Firstly, if cryptocurrency is regulated in your jurisdiction like in the United States, File your complaint with the SEC. Why file with the SEC? Some of these companies are registered and it is the duty of the SEC to regulate them. Filing will make the SEC investigate and bring down the company. This is usually not the case as we have experienced in our quest to recover money for victims of fraud. Virtually all the companies are unregistered and are usually operated by fake individuals with fake identities. So reporting to the SEC may not really do justice.<p>File a report with any Law enforcement agency in your jurisdiction, like the FBI in the US. The essence of this is for investigation but this usually is not an easy one since most of them operate with fake identities and FBI’s investigation is usually very slow. Making it that before the investigations concluded the scorn would have emptied the wallet.<p>The next is that if the amount lost is what you can bear, please bear it and invest no more.<p>The last option is that you should try using virtual asset recovery companies. However, i must strongly advise you to thread with caution because most of these investment companies now pose to be recovery companies and they are out there to steal from you. This is owing to our experience in the recovery industry.<p>Some people have been defrauded twice because they went to the wrong place to seek help. Do not be desperate. When you send your complaint to contact@activebonorum.com the firm will review your claim to ensure that you really invested with these companies and if the same turns out to be successful, the firm would proceed from there.<p>Finally, I must advise you to inform those around you that you have been defrauded due to the trauma that comes with this. Also to recover all, log on to www.activebonorum.com"],"time":["2020-09-04 00:44:32"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["toossmm"],"id":[24369723],"kids":{},"parent":[24334150],"text":["I JUST TRIED THIS NO UPFRONT PAYMENT !!!!!

There&#x27;s weird stuff in Javascript, but if you&#x27;re going to have a default (and there&#x27;s good reason to say that you shouldn&#x27;t, and that `sort` without a parameter should just throw an error), I think this is the <i>right<\/i> choice for them to have made about how the default should work.<p>Lots of intuitions about what the developer meant seem simple when you&#x27;re only looking at the simple case.

On one hand, the concept of &#x27;race&#x27; is what allows racism to exist and we need to remove this concept from our collective ideology in order to defeat racism -- people are just people. On the other hand, it is a fact that external biological characteristics (predominantly skin colour and facial structure) result in social clustering and discrimination, at the individual, collective and institutional levels -- racism is real.<p>I appreciate the principles behind race abolitionism, as I have often applied the same logic to gender, which is arguably even more socially constructed than race, since the appeal to biological characteristics is weaker for defining one&#x27;s gender than one&#x27;s race. However, if we remove these ideas from our collective understanding of the world, do we not make it harder to argue cases of legitimate discrimination? If the generally accepted notion is &quot;gender does not exist&quot; or &quot;race does not exist&quot;, how does one make the argument &quot;I was discriminated against because of &lt;attributes&gt;?&quot; Or is the idea that once people no longer make the distinction between different groups of attributes, then individual and institutional discrimination will no longer exist? It seems to me that in order for such an approach to be successful, we would need to train ourselves to not notice external characteristics of individuals, effectively becoming colour-blind, a task which not only seems impossible due to the nature of the human mind, but also a dangerous position to take while racism still exists -- since it also blinds us to an understanding of why a person was discriminated against and what factors affected their experience --, and risks destroying our concept of cultural heritage.

I haven&#x27;t been a Mozilla employee for more than a year and don&#x27;t have any internal information about recent developments)<p>Regarding Android: As many folks probably already know, the new Firefox for Android is a complete rewrite of the front-end to use an embedable version of gecko (GeckoView).  This entails re-implementing all the extension API support that existed in the old monolithic browser.  The timeline for switching from the Fennec (the original Firefox for Android) to Fenix (the GeckoView based version) was driven by a bunch of conflicting things.  In an ideal world it wouldn&#x27;t have happened until the extension support was broader, but we reached a point where Fennec can&#x27;t be maintained any longer yet full extension support in Fenix isn&#x27;t ready.  I don&#x27;t agree with the way Mozilla has handled this, but to be fair to them -- if they provide a way to easily enable extensions that they haven&#x27;t tested they will be flooded with reports about extensions that don&#x27;t work.  Sorting through all this would be a huge distraction to a team that&#x27;s already busy trying to complete the extension implementation.\nIt seems popular here to be skeptical about Mozilla&#x27;s goals and ascribe hidden motivations to them, but if you follow the work that&#x27;s happening on GeckoView extensions (go to bugzilla.mozilla.org search for product GeckoView, component Extensions), you can see that progress is happening slowly but steadily.<p>As for desktop and additional extension APIs: I think that this is another place Mozilla has dropped the ball on communication.  WebExtensions support a concept of &quot;experimental APIs&quot; with which developers can easily prototype new extension APIs.  The intention here was always that this would be an avenue for developers outside Mozilla to experiment with new ideas that could eventually become regular apis available to all extensions.  To be clear, the bar here is high: among other issues, many things that developers would like to be able to do from extensions are prone to abuse by malicious extensions.  Figuring out a way to create an API that allows for customization while also helping users understand how extensions are changing their browser and make an informed choice about whether to allow it is a difficult problem!  The developer community seemed to take Mozilla&#x27;s intention to expand extensions&#x27; capabilities as a promise to have Mozilla employees do all that work, rather than an invitation to work together with the community on the process of designing new APIs that can be used in a safe way."],"time":["2020-08-31 19:25:59"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["loughnane"],"id":[24331339],"kids":[24333215],"parent":[24330983],"text":["I&#x27;m ok with Mozilla making it _harder_ to install add-ons.

We have lots of evidence to back calorie restriction. We know that eating more earlier in the day vs later means your insulin levels can recover better (or something?). We know eating certain types of fats is bad for you, and eating certain types of other things are good for you. Exercise, or at least the right kind of exercise (seems like there are open questions here, like how much is actually important) is healthy.<p>Then there are a number of pills you can take. When it comes to the pills we have a lot less evidence. From what I&#x27;ve seen there are probably a dozen or so pills, each one with bits and pieces of science surrounding them, that will <i>maybe<\/i> have some impact on mortality or aging. Some of the research does seem quite compelling - niacin, for example, seems to be pretty well researched and is actually prescribed at times. Niacin is also one of the pills you&#x27;ll see come up a lot if you start looking into anti-aging. Others like resveratrol (which, actually, appears to be old news - people have moved on, it seems, to more bioavailable substances) have a lot less research, though they&#x27;re promising.<p>If you&#x27;re willing to spend 100-200 dollars a month or so it seems that you can get most or all of these. I don&#x27;t think <i>any<\/i> research has been done on what taking <i>all<\/i> of these will do to you, but there is research on how the chemicals behave and I suppose from there people seem to draw conclusions on interactions.<p>Interestingly, from what I&#x27;ve read a lot of the popular &quot;anti aging&quot; trends like anti-oxidants are, more or less, very much debunked. My understanding is that while anti-oxidants absolutely do what their name implies in a lab setting, most of them tend to not do a damn thing in humans with regards to oxidation. So who knows what is or isn&#x27;t going to work.<p>From my layman understanding, if you&#x27;re ~20 years old you can basically just not fuck up super hard and wait another decade and we&#x27;ll know a lot more. If you&#x27;re 30, definitely start taking health seriously but maybe don&#x27;t worry so much about downing 50 supplements that only have a bit of backing research. If you&#x27;re 40 and above, and your goal is life extension... you might have to take a gamble.<p>If you&#x27;re interested, I found this channel quite interesting - I appreciated the guy always citing studies (and he explicitly calls out why he thinks the study is or is not high quality).<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;channel&#x2F;UCpcvPcHJVOkO9Qp79BOagTg\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;channel&#x2F;UCpcvPcHJVOkO9Qp79BOagTg<\/a><p>This FAQ definitely seems to be a good &#x27;one stop shop&#x27; for learning the state of things, without being prescriptive.<p>I&#x27;m not a doctor. I just got interested in the last few weeks about this stuff. None of this is without risk - that much is obvious. Only just the other day I was reading a post by someone who ended up in the hospital with liver failure that very possibly could have been tied to their supplementation. If you start taking pills that you don&#x27;t understand you seem <i>very<\/i> likely to fuck things up - some pills require that you <i>take other pills also<\/i>, for example lots of nootropics will fuck you up if you don&#x27;t get enough choline in your diet. All of this is to say, there&#x27;s cool and promising stuff here, but do your own research, and if you&#x27;re very young and healthy don&#x27;t stress about this stuff yet - the first step is always diet and exercise."],"time":["2020-08-30 07:29:05"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["thiagotomei"],"id":[24321333],"kids":[24321356],"parent":[24320846],"text":["If people were dying in troves of a disease (...) every effort would be put on saving them, right?

The problematic assumption is this one:<p>&gt; When someone observes an event happening, it <i>really<\/i> happened.<p>Given the experiment from the paper, I would rephrase this assumption as &quot;it&#x27;s not possible to rewind things&quot;. But obviously inside a computer simulation made up of operations that are all individually reversible, it&#x27;s trivial to rewind things.<p>The experiment sets up a situation where certain information is reversibly recorded, and then the records are unmade by temporarily rewinding. The rewinding is obfuscated by hiding it inside of a measurement that is incompatible with the presence or absence of the record. I guess the authors might disagree about the measurement implying rewinding, but as a bit of evidence I&#x27;ll note that Scott Aaronson and Yosi Atia have shown that performing the measurement in question over a simulated agent is at least as expensive as rewinding the simulated agent [1]. Whatever is being done, it is doing some <i>seriously expensive<\/i> screwing around with the agent&#x27;s state. It&#x27;s like the experiment has a step where you feed the human through a giant meat processing plant, and for some reason everyone is pretending that&#x27;s not somehow important.<p>Basically, the authors are appealing to the intuition that humans are big complicated in-practice-irreversible things, so clearly a record is permanent if it has affected the state of a human. But then they imagine instantiating the human&#x27;s state inside a ridiculously powerful computer capable of reversibly simulating time advancing and of performing operations that have been engineered specifically to mess with the presence or absence of the record&#x27;s effects on the human&#x27;s state. Surprise surprise, the record gets messed with. Then for the actual experiment the big complicated ball of dependent spaghetti that is a human is replaced by a nice simple photon going along one path or another path.<p>1: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scottaaronson.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;?p=4786\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scottaaronson.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;?p=4786<\/a>"],"time":["2020-08-30 21:28:10"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["colordrops"],"id":[24324913],"kids":{},"parent":[24312083],"text":["Based on my very limited understanding it seems that anything that interacts with a system can be treated as an &quot;observer&quot;, and thus a chain of observations can occur as one particle interacts with the next, enlarging the system that is in superposition for the next observer.<p>Do physicists axiomatically treat a &quot;conscious observer&quot; as an atomic unit?
