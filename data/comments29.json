What is more, the feature sets of those distros form a non-planar non-directed graph of nodes for which it is very very difficult to reason about their feature content.<p>Consider for the moment if you could reason about distros like you can reason about genomes. In modern genetics we can look at flora, fauna, bacteria, etc and talk about them as a base class &quot;foo&quot; with specific genetic changes that get them to be a &quot;bar&quot;, we can talk about speciation where the genetics are different enough such that hybrids are infertile or impossible.<p>This effort tries, and I think largely succeeds, in capturing the &quot;minimum viable Linux <i>system<\/i>&quot; (all up kernel + user land). It gives you a way to reason about two different distros like<p>Ubuntu is Kiss plus (list of things) and for each item in the list of things, it has dependencies, recursively until you have completely described the genome of Ubuntu as a linear directed graph from Kiss. You could do the same thing for Fedora, or Mint, or any distro.<p>Two such graphs could give you a complete list of differences to get from distro &lt;a&gt; to distro &lt;b&gt; and the simple algorithm of walk back (remove items) from &lt;a&gt;, then walk down the graph (add items) to &lt;b&gt; would always &quot;work&quot; because they all share a common ancestor node, Kiss.<p>As a software developer you could reason about all of the changes to a distro you would need for your software to work, and this would tell you if those changes included removing something that was part of the canonical set of things in a distro, your software would not work on that distro.<p>Today, individual package managers do this in a distro unique way and let you work on one distro. As a software developer you end up with the &quot;Fedora&#x2F;Redhat&quot; version, the &quot;Ubuntu&#x2F;Debian&quot; version, maybe the &quot;Arch&#x2F;Gentoo&quot; version.<p>But if the Linux community settled on a common understanding of the &quot;genetic code&quot; if you will, you could do that for <i>all possible<\/i> distributions.

It would be cheaper to fly literally every employee out once a quarter and throw a giant party than to maintain an office space sized for the same amount of people by an order of magnitude in a large, popular city (NYC office space is approximately ~$100&#x2F;sqft&#x2F;month - a desk sized for two monitors, a keyboard and writing space is about 2 x 4 minimum, so 8sqft, or $800&#x2F;month just for a single person in a nice space)<p>In other words, being <i>forced<\/i> to do anything - whether that was working from home or from an office - is an oppressive activity. Remote-first simply gives back that freedom of choice. Companies can maintain more minimalist offices for those who insist, and coworking spaces will grow for those who don&#x27;t like the office and want separation, and finally those who have the space in their homes can work from home.<p>I&#x27;d be curious to hear a good argument against all organizations that <i>can be<\/i> remote-first being remote-first."],"time":["2020-05-21 18:19:47"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["poxrud"],"id":[23260852],"kids":{},"parent":[23259159],"text":["I find this strange as they&#x27;ve just recently opened brand new fancy offices in Toronto.

Were stable, balanced and rich human-to-human connections available in the child&#x27;s community - or was it lacking? A supportive and safe environment means meeting a child&#x27;s needs for being seen and heard, skills it needs when it learns to navigate more and more complexity (as well as developing curiosity), as well as being able to work well with others.<p>In my case, and with my ADHD, I think it had more to do with a lack of attunement than with my genetics. My dad holds a Phd in Physics, and my mom is a remedial teacher.<p>I connect my ADHD to my experience of emotional neglect. I moved around the world with my parents (Netherlands, Middle East, US and UK), and after our first expat &#x27;posting&#x27; when I was 6 y&#x2F;o, my parents were not able to give me the space to grieve the loss of my connections with my family and community in my home country. Compounding this with a stressed out (and himself also emotionally neglected) father and a depressed mother (also emotionally neglected), my life become confined to very narrow waterways.<p>The traditional schooling systems was a terrifying experience for me (disclaimer: I went through an unusually large amount of schools as an expat child).

How do you accept the diversity of thoughts and opinions, many of which run contrary to your own, but are perfectly valid in a diverse society?<p>Currently, &#x2F;r&#x2F;india has a bunch of moderators with a severe political stance (I won&#x27;t go into specifics here, but I&#x27;ve been banned from it several times). They will warn you and ultimately ban you if you don&#x27;t toe their &quot;moderation&quot; line. So on the one hand you have the &quot;in&quot; group of people threatening violence and harassing people; and on the other, you have the complement set of people getting banned for using words like &quot;naive&quot; (happened to me). There current moderation system (whoever started the reddit, and whoever they blessed, get to be moderators; sortof like a monarchy and a feudal system) is horribly out of date in today&#x27;s world.<p>Here&#x27;s how I would fix it: every year, have an election of moderators. People get votes proportional to their karma (or upvotes or some function thereof, which could heavily penalize bad posting behavior) earned since the last election.

Large platforms can’t thoroughly patrol every nook and cranny without unreasonable amounts of employees. And yet it’s never been more important to have fair and timely moderation on serious issues.

It could easily add an extra year into the wait time. I myself havet 1+ year in the wait list but that will probably extend to 2+ years.<p>To give a sense of wait time, it varies from region to region. The bay area region is pretty long wait. I think UCSF is 10+ years of wait for a type O blood recipient. In Sacramento area its a 5+ year wait. If you are type AB blood the wait is almost half the time. Some parts of the country the wait times is as short at 1 year.<p>Although I am somewhat eager for kidney transplant, I also know its not a cure. They might last 10-15 years before you get rejection and have to get another transplant or go back on dialysis. But the anti-rejection medications have slowly improved. Mainly been trying to stay as healthy and stable as possible.<p>The stay-at-home rules has also been a blessing though because I do home dialysis and that takes a lot of time so not having to travel to work means extra time is available.

Can anyone pinpoint that in the actual text of the bill?<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.congress.gov&#x2F;bill&#x2F;116th-congress&#x2F;house-bill&#x2F;6172\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.congress.gov&#x2F;bill&#x2F;116th-congress&#x2F;house-bill&#x2F;6172<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-21 17:46:39"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["winslow"],"id":[23261120],"kids":[23261433,23262141,23262403],"parent":[23258823],"text":["It&#x27;s clear that the government(s) haven&#x27;t had people&#x27;s interest for quite a while now.

I always use local apps rather than webservices if possible. I use only free software, built from source, to be sure there&#x27;s no tracker in it (I would love to find a way to whitelist which apps can access the network, but I haven&#x27;t found a way for that yet). There&#x27;s almost always a way to perform a task locally.<p>2. I have a copy of wikipedia, using kiwix (through kiwix-serve). My default search engine is my local wikipedia&#x27;s one. It&#x27;s insane the amount of answers you can get to common questions simply with a local copy of wikipedia<p>3. I always install documentation for the libraries I download. I have `go doc` running locally, always install ruby gems with ri and rdoc, set the gentoo&#x27;s `doc` use flag to have C libraries documentation locally. Most of the time, there&#x27;s just no need to go to the web for API documentation.<p>4. I made myself a rss client similar to rss2mail that will fetch rss feeds and mail items to me. When sending a mail, the rss client makes a http request to the full article url and add it to the mail as attachment. Then I read my content in mutt, having lynx dumping the html content as plain text (through `lynx -dump`). So I read all the content offline, and nobody can tell what I read. I have my own smtp server so that I disclose the least information possible.<p>5. when I have to use the web, this is first through a text browser through tor (I use a modified version of elinks, but I guess lynx would do just as well). This makes sure I only download the html page I want to look at, while running the least possible tracking stuff.<p>6. when it&#x27;s not enough, I have a chromium build, in which I have disabled javascript and images by default. I use chromium rather than firefox because it allows me to load extensions from sources. I have such extensions to enable javascript and images if needed, but this is the ultimate recourse.<p>7. I use my own local dns resolver. I don&#x27;t know why people don&#x27;t do that more, it&#x27;s actually really simple. bind9 resolver works out of the box, you just install bind9, change &#x2F;etc&#x2F;resolv.conf to point to 127.0.0.1, and that&#x27;s it.<p>8. if I post online (like now), I make a different account every time I post, using always a different email address. This allows to prevent profiling from public posts.<p>9. and of course, I&#x27;m actively researching everything related to the p2p web, like dat, ssb and cabal.<p>So basically, I took the red pill."],"time":["2020-05-21 17:35:17"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["specialagent"],"id":[23260695],"kids":[23265717,23261717],"parent":[23258823],"text":["At one point in time, we used to universally celebrate people like Professor John Raines, who broke into FBI offices to steal documents related to COINTELPRO.

Because, after some experience with the keyboard, your brain knows exactly how to jerk a finger to get a particular character and can do that very fast (touch typing particularly excels at this since the normal positions of the fingers are fixed—and it&#x27;s aptly called ‘blind typing’ in some languages). Meanwhile, to lay stuff out on the screen you need to 1) find with your eyes where to grab a block and 1b) where to put it; 2) move the mouse to grab the block and 2b) to drop it, and sometimes also do that with connectors too. Both of these kinds of operations—visual and manual—are way slower than mechanical jerking of the limbs, especially due to them being prone to error. Even worse if you have to drag-and-drop instead of just clicking. All this fiddling requires you to pay close attention to things on the screen, while typing mostly allows the visual system to coast along or tune out altogether. Multiply this by hundreds of words a day, and you&#x27;ll see that visual programming is in large part an exercise in mouse-brandishing amid visual load, in the vein of FPSes. And usually you have to regularly move the hands to the keyboard anyway, to name your blocks, variables and whatnot.<p>On phones, the difference shrinks since typing relies on just two thumbs with no fixed position and no physical keys—while onscreen manipulation gets more immediate compared to a mouse. However, phones suffer from short supply of screen area where you pick and place the blocks. In my experience, it would still make sense to choose blocks with typing (by filtering in real-time from the entire list), and to minimize the work of placement—like in Scratch or Tasker.<p>Visual programming <i>might<\/i> have distinct value if it allowed to manipulate higher-level concepts compared to text-based coding. However, it turns out that the current building blocks of code work pretty well in providing both conciseness and flexibility, so visual blocks tend to just clone them. Again, the situation is better is you can ride on some APIs specific to your problem domain—like movement commands in Scratch or phone automation in Tasker and ‘Automate’. Similarly, laying out higher-level concepts like in UML or database diagrams has its own benefit by making the structure and connections more prominent."],"time":["2020-05-21 15:03:01"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["gapo"],"id":[23253138],"kids":[23253561],"parent":[23252448],"text":["You are completely ignoring the vast swathe of &#x27;engineering&#x27; programming market that is covered by Simulink, LabVIEW etc."],"time":["2020-05-21 01:15:46"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["gen3"],"id":[23253547],"kids":[23253807,23254084,23254157],"parent":[23252448],"text":["In college I had to use labVIEW; a visual language normally used for automation.

(Unity shader graph etc..)<p>Now, as far as Simulink is concerned, I feel that it was (and possibly still is) an ergonomic disaster zone. There&#x27;s just too much mousing around and adjusting routing between nodes. Also, merging is really difficult because of the save file format. This is a significant problem for many engineering organisations.<p>For any visual programming tool, the value of a visual graph diminishes as the graph becomes more complex. It is most valuable when it is kept simple and illustrates e.g. high level components only.<p>Now ... none of these problems is insurmountable, and having a relatively simple high-level graph to show the relationship between the major components of a system is an incredibly valuable communications tool -- but users do need to resist the temptation to use the graph for everything down to every if statement and for loop. These things are best used to explain the high level relationship between major system components and the overall flow of data through the system. Fine grained algorithms are better represented textually.<p>So, over the years I&#x27;ve developed a configuration-driven framework that&#x27;s designed to (eventually) be driven from a visual UI.<p>Computationally, the framework implements a Kahn process network. I.e. it&#x27;s a dataflow model, where the nodes represent sequential processes, and the edges have queue semantics. (The queue implementation can be replaced with implicitly synchronised shared memory in some situations, so it can be quite efficient).<p>This enables me to e.g. implement intelligent cacheing of data flows, support record-and-replay style debugging, co-simulation, and automatic component-test generation.<p>The nodes can be arbitrary unix-philosophy binaries, Python functions, or native shared libraries. (Eventually I plan to support deploying nodes to FPGA as well), and because of the Kahn process network semantics, behave in the same way irrespective of how the nodes are distributed across computers on the network. This makes it an ideal rapid-prototyping tool for quickly integrating existing software components together. E.g. throwing machine learning components together that have been written in different languages or using different frameworks. It&#x27;s a bit like ROS in this regard.<p>The dataflow graph itself is represented by a set of YAML files (or data structures that can be generated&#x2F;modified at runtime), with different aspects (connectivity, node definitions, layout) separated to make textual diffs and merges easy to understand, and enabling teams to work more effectively together.<p>Also, because the graph is explicitly represented as a design-time data structure rather than being a runtime construct, it&#x27;s easy to use GraphViz to generate diagrams, allowing you to have documentation that&#x27;s correct by definition without spending ages adjusting untidy connections and layouts. (Although I do want to spend some time improving the layout algorithms and providing some mechanism for layout hinting).<p>Right now, you can only generate the visual graph from the textual description. In future I want to make it possible to edit the graph visually, so you can (for example), drag and drop compute nodes onto different computers really easily; stop, rewind and replay history, and simulate the effects of e.g. network contention and experiment with moving nodes around the available hardware to optimise performance.<p>I&#x27;m also experimenting with hybrid symbolic&#x2F;statistical AI techniques that use the data flow graph to help with fault finding, automatic safety-case generation etc.. etc.."],"time":["2020-05-21 10:42:06"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["narrationbox"],"id":[23254394],"kids":[23254551,23256468],"parent":[23252448],"text":["Story time (and a post-mortem of sorts): a long time ago I built a startup using Visual Programming for algorithmic trading.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hackernoon.com&#x2F;on-kloudtrader-and-visual-programming-5161e1e2b89f\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hackernoon.com&#x2F;on-kloudtrader-and-visual-programming...<\/a><p>It wasn&#x27;t the most novel idea or anything but most existing systems were either clunky, expensive, or had UIs from the previous century. Ours was a hip SaaS inspired by Robin Hood, Bubble.is, and all the new Bloomberg terminal clones. We built an initial prototype using Google Blockly, did a ton of UI&#x2F;UX research (studied every visual programming system from Sutherland&#x27;s Sketchpad, to the Soviet DRAKON, to modern day MindStorms, Scratch, and the various PLC control systems and LabView derivatives) and slowly built out the rest of the algorithmic trading stack. It was tremendously difficult mainly because of lack of labor, our small startup only had 3 people. We were essentially translating by hand entire trading frameworks, backtesting tooling, and blotters into virtual Lego bricks. It was my first startup and I was inexperienced. We were fresh faced and between trying to raise funding, sales and marketing, product development, progress was slow. Patio11&#x27;s (Kalzumeus) blog posts on Stockfighter were highly inspirational and we saw what they managed with only a small team and we tried to replicate. But between Patrick and the Ptaceks, they had several decades more engineering and business experience than us, something we completely discounted. The tooling around Google&#x27;s visual programming system was like early Android development, works in theory but tremendously difficult to use. Microsoft&#x27;s Makecode (which is also built on Blockly) had a magnitude more engineering manpower than us. Visual programming was not easy to build quickly — a production quality system wasn&#x27;t something that you can clone in a weekend. We looked towards automation, around the same time, a code synthesis YC company called Optic appeared and we strongly considered leveraging them to allow us to build out faster.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=17560059\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=17560059<\/a><p>However, a couple months later, YC funded a similar company called Mudrex who had a prettier UI and a founding team with a stronger fintech track record.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=19347443\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=19347443<\/a><p>At that point we crossed the rubicon and pivoted to DevOps&#x2F;PaaS, launching a Heroku-style product.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;KloudTrader.com&#x2F;Narwhal\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;KloudTrader.com&#x2F;Narwhal<\/a><p>Did the whole tour of Docker Swarm, Kubernetes, KVM etc. Built out our own cloud almost from scratch. Signed a contract with a broker to offer comission-free trading and everything. But it was a difficult product to sell in a crowded enterprise market with only a few (but big) customers and we were playing catch-up with companies like Alpaca, our product was being eaten from the corners by new features launched by companies like Quantopian and Quantconnect. Quantopian was where I cut my teeth on computational finance and automated trading, it was what inspired me to build a fintech startup in the first place, so in many aspects, our product being displaced was a validation of product-market fit if nothing else. In retrospect, at that time we should have switched to the ML Ops market instead, which is booming right now. Algorithmic trading, or at least the consumer focused variety that we were trying to sell, had a stack that is very similar to your usual ML stacks. In the two years I learnt about enterprise sales, the various shenanigans involved in FINRA, SEC compliance, and was tremendously valuable in terms of growth.<p>These days however we are mainly doing productivity software for voiceovers and transcriptions with a bit of ML thrown in (voice cloning research). Fast growth, easy traction, great market. Not as lucrative as fintech, or at least a lower ceiling, but at our current rate of growth I am certainly not complaining. It is hosted mainly on Google Cloud, AWS, and other providers (after having to build our own Heroku we have had enough of DevOps)<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;narrationbox.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;narrationbox.com<\/a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;narrationbox\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;narrationbox<\/a><p>If you are looking for advice or suggestions on building your own visual programming systems, I am available for consulting services.<p>(On second thought I should probably turn this comment into a Medium post)"],"time":["2020-05-21 04:54:18"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["golergka"],"id":[23257126],"kids":{},"parent":[23252448],"text":["Unreal blueprints and Unity playmaker are doing great, by the way."],"time":["2020-05-21 13:26:51"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["aylmao"],"id":[23256178],"kids":[23256292,23261298],"parent":[23252448],"text":["I&#x27;ve thought about this, and I think I have a general sense as to why.<p>First, let&#x27;s look at the size of the keyboard in relation to the screen: it&#x27;s huge. In most laptops, it is about half the size of the screen. Keys easy to use— they all work the same way, and we all grow up knowing how to use letters. You can press several at once, press them in quick succession, plus they are huge and haptic. You don&#x27;t have to be precise with how you press one, and you feel it when it presses: your eyes, fingers and ears are all telling you that the information you&#x27;re transmitting is making it to the screen.<p>You effectively have a very big, very good, dedicated toolbar and the rest of your screen is either your canvas (the text area) or can be used for other tools to augment your programming.<p>With visual programming languages, you have to reserve part of this screen real estate, for the input. It&#x27;s like having to put your keyboard on screen: leaves you less space for the canvas or additional tools. Moreover, these UI elements are often smaller than the keys in a keyboard, and hovering&#x2F;clicking something with a mouse doesn&#x27;t provide haptic feedback. All this means a little more mental effort when composing with the mouse, and doing all the aiming, clicking, dragging and dropping. It&#x27;s more &quot;precise&quot; and &quot;delicate&quot; movements that require more &quot;attention&quot;, if you will.<p>On top of that consider that there is no visual programming environment is ever &quot;fully&quot; visual— there&#x27;s always typing involved at some point or another. You have to enter a number, a string, the name of a variable, etc. All this switching between the keyboard and the mouse is even more movement, more attention, more cognitive load to the layout of ideas. There is a reason all these modern IDEs have a &quot;VIM mode&quot;— you&#x27;d think our new tools would replace an older, more complicated way of doing things, but VIM has managed to survive in the hearts of experienced programmers because it allows them to type without reaching to the mouse.<p>Let&#x27;s delve into this. For an unexperienced programmer, &quot;wording&quot; the idea (remembering the syntax, etc) probably takes enough time that laying it out is not the bottleneck. For an experienced programmer, finding the idea is the bottleneck, but once found, wording it is quick, and so laying it down becomes the bottleneck. Being able to express things quickly becomes important.<p>Moreover, revisiting this &quot;finding the idea&quot; and &quot;wording the idea&quot;— because wording the idea is fast, an experienced programmer might write while it&#x27;s still looking for the right idea, as a way of &quot;thinking out loud&quot;. They will type something, delete it, type something else, backspace repeatedly, etc. Seeing it in front of them helps the idea materialize, kind of how a musician might play notes as it&#x27;s thinking of a melody, or digital tools allows artists to paint strokes and undo as they draw [1: notice in this link how a  digital artist works. They&#x27;re constantly drawing and erasing. It&#x27;s the first video I found when searching &quot;painting digital&quot;].<p>This is harder and slower to do with current visual tools.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;1lemi11CgLs?t=1200\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;1lemi11CgLs?t=1200<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-21 10:45:03"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["toxicFork"],"id":[23258363],"kids":{},"parent":[23252448],"text":["It&#x27;s very early days."],"time":["2020-05-21 15:54:51"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["anotheryou"],"id":[23257129],"kids":{},"parent":[23252448],"text":["2D space is quite limited in arrangement I think (and with 3D you always have occlusion).<p>There are very established graphical programming languages in the art-scene.

It was very good fit for our system, but it still had lots of problems.<p>The tooling was pretty bad (it was a plugin for older version of eclipse, had pretty bad bugs). We added our functionality to that plugin, and these were big usability wins, but also it made the plugin even less stable.<p>Sometimes the graphical editor would &quot;desynchronize&quot; and if you haven&#x27;t noticed you could be editing the process in graphical editor for 2 hours, but the XML file would remain unchanged (or even broken).<p>So developers became paranoid about changing to the XML view every few seconds to check, or they just edited the XML directly all the time :)<p>We had problems with several things that are solved in regular languages. For example there were subprocesses (analog of functions) - you could invoke a subprocess, pass arguments, wait for it to end, and receive return values from the subprocess. That solved problem of duplication of common functionality, but also required us to add support for pretty complex mappings when invoking subprocesses.<p>For example we had a node that does a HQL query and shows the results in table on the user terminal. These queries were parametrized, and some parameters were constant in each process, just changed between processes. So we added a way to specify these parameters. Then there were some processes where it would be useful to specify additional conditions for a query in the graphical editor. So we added that.<p>Then it would be useful to pass around that conditions between subprocesses, and fill some parameters there in some subprocesses, while the others remain to be filled by the app server.<p>It was much too complex (I am mostly to blame - I was straight out of university and was amazed by this cool technology and wanted to add all the bells and whistles I could think of :) ).<p>What we should do instead is just duplicate the subprocesses with different conditions, or construct these conditions in java code on app server and just call that from the graphical designer.<p>Eventully like half of all our business logic was encoded in the nodes that invoked subprocesses in the mapping between inner and outer process variables.<p>The other half was mostly in the conditions on transitions between the nodes.<p>Both of these things weren&#x27;t visible when you looked at the whole graph - transitions only showed labels (which were sometimes outdated vs the REAL condition code), and the invoke process nodes showed nothing until you clicked on them.<p>So when you had a big process with 40 nodes you had to click on each node (and scroll through sometimes 30 mappings) to see &quot;who set that variable&quot;.<p>Same with transitions - you had to click on each transition to see the conditions.<p>We tried to show the conditions in the main view but it wasn&#x27;t easily changed in that plugin.<p>Overall I think the graph language was great, the automatic transaction and persistence support was the best things about it, but the visual programming aspect of it was rarely useful, and very often problematic.<p>I would now go the other way - have the graph language be text-first (with some nice DSL), and rendered to a nice graphical view on-demand.<p>Better tooling could probably help, but we spent maybe 3 man-years on fixing and improving that plugin and it never worked great.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.jboss.org&#x2F;tools&#x2F;whatsnew&#x2F;jbpm&#x2F;images&#x2F;multiple-processes-in-folder.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.jboss.org&#x2F;tools&#x2F;whatsnew&#x2F;jbpm&#x2F;images&#x2F;multiple-p...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-21 12:26:33"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["NotZerg"],"id":[23255811],"kids":{},"parent":[23252448],"text":["Because visual programming won&#x27;t ever be as efficient and particular."],"time":["2020-05-21 09:43:16"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["KhoomeiK"],"id":[23262268],"kids":[23267736,23264447,23263070],"parent":[23250885],"text":["I&#x27;m an undergrad research ~intern for one of the professors on this paper! :)<p>Edit: I&#x27;ve been corresponding with Professor Fehren-Schmitz of the Human Paleogenomics lab at UCSC for the past few months and will likely be focusing on improving computational workflows at the lab in the next few months.

I spent two years developing on a framework I built myself, until I finally gave in and spent an inconvenient amount of time porting to Django.<p>1) Unless you have a lot of experience, you don&#x27;t know why various patterns have been implemented, or various compromises have been made, in existing frameworks. Frameworks aren&#x27;t on the whole built by idiots, and if you think a framework has made an obviously poor choice, count the days until you realise why they did it. If you&#x27;re lucky your choice will still make sense for your application. If you&#x27;re not, I hope it doesn&#x27;t take you too long to redo it all.<p>2) As the author says, frameworks are by nature declarative. This is great if you have really good documentation, but if not you&#x27;re going to scream trying to work out the control flow of your application. &quot;Why does changing variable X result in behaviour Y? What is even checking variable X? grep&#x27;s returning nothing, the stacktrace is twenty levels deep and I don&#x27;t recognise any of these functions. FUCCCCCCKK!&quot;<p>You&#x27;re going to forget how your framework works. If you don&#x27;t forget there was no point building it at all, because the point of a framework is to abstract you from having to think about things.<p>3) Your project&#x27;s not that special. The framework your considering will probably work just fine. It&#x27;s worked for several million other projects, it&#x27;ll work for yours. Yes, you might spend a bit of time trying to shoehorn something in. It&#x27;ll be an order of magnitude less time than building an entirely new system.<p>4) It&#x27;s much less useful for future work. A high-level understanding of building frameworks will get you a job at the Django Foundation. An high-level understanding of Django will get you a job everywhere else.

Since these operations are not associative, the above approaches do not\nwork so well any more even if the `P` can be guesstimated.

Something has gone terribly wrong with your civilization.<p>— <U+2042> —<p>I think about the Isla Maciel slums where I used to volunteer.  They&#x27;re on the outskirts of Buenos Aires, and although I&#x27;m not familiar with any official statistics, I think the average daily income is under a dollar per person per day, with significant variation above and below that level.  Some of the roads are dirt while others are paved, and the buildings are mostly somewhat ramshackle houses made of hollow brick with corrugated iron roofs.  It&#x27;s sort of similar to some of the neighborhoods I lived in as a kid in the US before I moved into a trailer park.<p>Despite this astonishing level of income, there is no homelessness (though there is elsewhere in Buenos Aires), and almost nobody rents.  This is because people build their own houses.  The most common material is hollow ceramic brick, the kind that&#x27;s a latticework of thin red-clay walls; you have to scavenge or buy these <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;articulo.mercadolibre.com.ar&#x2F;MLA-821163523-ladrillo-hueco-12x18x33-9-tubos-pallet-144-unidades-zona-sur-_JM?quantity=1#position=13&amp;type=item&amp;tracking_id=9848aa63-e0a0-4f35-a558-f9709cb9ac9e\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;articulo.mercadolibre.com.ar&#x2F;MLA-821163523-ladrillo-...<\/a> at a cost of about AR$6000 (US$50) per pallet of 144 bricks, which works out to about 35¢ per brick.  The poorest people instead build with wood, like people in the US.  (We haven&#x27;t had an earthquake here during human habitation.)<p>If you do the figures, you can see that a generous 7 m × 3 m wall contains about US$130 worth of bricks, plus a smaller and cheaper amount of sand and cement.  You can build a 49 m² house from four of these walls (US$520) plus 49 m² of corrugated steel, which if you have to buy it <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;articulo.mercadolibre.com.ar&#x2F;MLA-799438818-chapa-acanalada-galvanizada-c30-por-6-metros-_JM?variation=40260420703#position=10&amp;type=item&amp;tracking_id=df5f6081-993b-4eff-a37e-abbf02e1f477\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;articulo.mercadolibre.com.ar&#x2F;MLA-799438818-chapa-aca...<\/a> is about AR$24000 (US$200).  Putting these parts together into an actual building envelope typically takes a semi-skilled laborer a week or two, and most people either do it themselves or have their sons, boyfriends, or husbands do it, since they don&#x27;t have any money to hire someone else.  Adding a toilet, a sink, a bidet (we are not barbarians, after all), some PVC pipes for water and sewer, and a kind of shitty electrical installation (hopefully with at least a circuit breaker) might bring the total out-of-pocket cost close to US$1000.<p>You might note that US$1000 is significantly less than US$414000.<p>Now, Isla Maciel is a dangerous place.  Everyone has lost family members either to gang violence or to police violence.  I wouldn&#x27;t advise visiting without knowing anybody there any more than I&#x27;d advise trying to visit the US without a visa; people there laugh about the stories of the tourists who mistakenly wandered into their neighborhood and got robbed.  I&#x27;m not holding it up as an ideal of human civilization.  But I&#x27;d much rather have a house in Isla Maciel than a park bench in Los Angeles or a rat-infested motel room in Solana Beach.<p>And I don&#x27;t think the violence there is a result of a lack of enforcement of building codes, as someone will no doubt attempt to argue in response to this comment.  Rather, both the insecurity and the freedom to build your own house result from the lawlessness of the neighborhood, which in turn proceeds from a general feeling that the law establishes oppression rather than justice — a proposition with ample empirical support within the confines of Isla Maciel, in my view, as well as other similar slums in Buenos Aires.  This in turn undermines officially recognized systems of land tenure, with the consequence that residents of Isla Maciel can often claim land by building on it, if that doesn&#x27;t piss off the neighbors too badly.<p>— <U+2042> —<p>How much would building such a house in the US cost, if it were somehow allowed?  Let&#x27;s suppose the cost of labor is some US$30 per hour (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ziprecruiter.com&#x2F;Salaries&#x2F;How-Much-Does-a-Construction-Worker-Make-an-Hour\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ziprecruiter.com&#x2F;Salaries&#x2F;How-Much-Does-a-Constr...<\/a> gives an average of US$16&#x2F;hour with a range of US$9–23, but this doesn&#x27;t include overhead, worker&#x27;s comp, unemployment insurance, etc.) which works out to US$2400 for two person-weeks.  So maybe the total cost is US$3400, including materials and labor.   So the cost of labor isn&#x27;t the problem.  Something has gone terribly wrong with your civilization.<p>— <U+2042> —<p>I reread Laura Ingalls Wilder&#x27;s <i>Little House on the Prairie<\/i> last month, and I was struck by the description of the building process. If we take the description in the book as factual (not everything in the book is, but I assume in this case Ingalls Wilder was doing her best) it took a couple of weeks for a skilled carpenter and an unskilled assistant to build the single-room log cabin which afterwards housed a family of five for a year, plus another few days for the fireplace.  But this was using raw materials from nature — trees chopped down and hauled from the creek by horse-drawn wagon, mud mortar to hold the fireplace stones together, mud for the chimney.  (The chimney later caught fire due to shoddy construction and nearly burned down the house, and a dropped-log accident nearly broke Ma&#x27;s foot.  Building codes and safety rules are important!)  Presumably the family had an outhouse for defecation, although the book shrinks from even mentioning such matters.<p>She doesn&#x27;t give dimensions for the house, but it seems to have been around 4 m × 5 m, some 20 m², less than half the size I described above.  My own apartment is 40 m²; fortunately I&#x27;m spending the quarantine at my girlfriend&#x27;s apartment, which is some 50 m². (The roof leaks, the pipes burst, the curtains billow from the wind even when the window is closed, and whoever installed the electricals was either an idiot or a homicidal maniac, but she had my refrigerator, you see…)<p>— <U+2042> —<p>How did we get from a situation where an average person could build a five-person house with four person-weeks of labor — 0.08 years&#x27; of per-capita GDP — without even the support of a manufacturing base to provide them with boards, bricks, and toilets, to a situation where an &quot;affordable housing&quot; unit costs 6 years&#x27; worth of the US per-capita GDP, and 7 years of the US median household income?  That is, a median <i>household<\/i> in the US now needs to work for <i>seven years<\/i> to pay the cost of building a house, rather than two weeks.  Half the population earns less even than that.  When it comes to housing buying power, people in the US are <i>three orders of magnitude poorer<\/i> than 150 years ago, or than in the worst slums of Buenos Aires today.  Something has gone terribly wrong with your civilization.<p>Some people might cite the cost of land (both the Isla Maciel residents and Ingalls Wilder&#x27;s family simply took their land without paying for it), but consider <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.landsofamerica.com&#x2F;property&#x2F;0.2-acres-in-Los-Angeles-County-California&#x2F;7848448&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.landsofamerica.com&#x2F;property&#x2F;0.2-acres-in-Los-Ang...<\/a>, 0.2 undeveloped acres for US$175000, about 20 km from downtown LA.  In non-medieval units, that&#x27;s 800 m², enough for 15 of the 49 m² single-story houses I described above, which works out to US$12000 per house; if you dig a basement, you could cut that to US$6000 per house, at some penalty to the construction cost.  Moreover, if you could build a 15-story apartment building on half of that land (you can&#x27;t, it&#x27;s zoned industrial), it would hold some 100 apartments of 49 m² each, at a land cost of US$1750 per apartment.  In a skyscraper you have to pour reinforced concrete slabs for floors, which isn&#x27;t free, but at ground level it typically costs on the order of US$50 per square meter, which is only US$2500 for 50 m².  $1750 + $2500 + $3400 = $7650 « $414000!  Something has gone terribly wrong with your civilization.<p>Some people might cite Baumol&#x27;s cost disease: when productivity goes up, wages go up, and so goods that have fixed labor requirements become more expensive; Baumol&#x27;s example is an hour of chamber quartet music, which continues to require four musicians for an hour, just as in 1787.  (The article itself blames &quot;union-level wages&quot; for construction workers.)  But that explanation would suggest that construction workers like Miguel Zamora could easily buy housing, and we know that&#x27;s not true.  Even if the whole workforce was earning the US$51 per hour cited for plumbers in the article, that would only add another US$2500 or so per dwelling to the numbers I calculated above.<p>— <U+2042> —<p>What if, instead of using ten-thousand-year-old technologies like log cabins and bricks cemented together with mortar, we used modern technology to build housing?<p>You might get something like the Hexayurt, which costs under US$500, can be built by one unskilled person in less than a day, and shows up by the thousands every Burning Man: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;hexayurt.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;hexayurt.com&#x2F;<\/a> — although there are some fire safety concerns with the material, so stuccoing it might be advisable.  That might double the cost.<p>High-cube 40-foot shipping containers cost about US$7000 (or much less, used) and can be stacked into buildings many stories high; they are watertight, laugh at earthquakes, and have 28 m² of floor area.  For $414000 you could buy dozens of them, maybe hundreds.<p>Or you might get something like modern trailer houses; I don&#x27;t know how much these cost to make, but you can get them used for US$20k–US$40k, full of amenities like gas stoves, showers, cabinets, glass windows all around, multiple bathrooms, electrical outlets in all the walls, and central heating, unheard of in both Ingalls Wilder&#x27;s time and in Isla Maciel.  But could we maybe sacrifice some of the outlets, and the heavy welded steel frame that allows you to move your house to a different trailer park, in exchange for ending homelessness?<p>Something has gone terribly, terribly wrong with your civilization."],"time":["2020-05-21 22:34:23"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["TA_askhn_iplaw"],"id":[23266547],"kids":[23267572],"parent":[23260557],"text":["I live in Solana Beach, a few blocks from the Pearl site.

All of the below also specifically applies to white-collar tech employees.<p>There are two big issues with a lot of employees at AWS, not knowing their worth and not having backbone.<p>It is not a privilege to work for Amazon. It is a privilege for Amazon that you work for them. In this particular case, this person says that he was an SDE II. That&#x27;s great. You should be able to pretty easily go get a job at any of the other large tech companies. You&#x27;re not locked into Amazon. You likely have a CS degree. You&#x27;ve got a couple years of industry experience in a field where most companies can&#x27;t hire fast enough.<p>That said, don&#x27;t leave Amazon. Leave your team. Internal transfers are easy and no longer gated on you being on a team for a certain amount of time. Start talking to other people from other teams and find a good fit. Most internal transfers are about culture fit and you likely won&#x27;t be asked any coding questions.<p>You are not obligated by anything to stay on your team. End of. Amazon is one of the largest companies in the world. Don&#x27;t feel some sort of personal responsibility to stay on one team. That&#x27;s just not reasonable. They&#x27;ll find a way to make do without you and if they can&#x27;t why do you really care? At some local mom and pop shop, sure you may not want to leaving the owner hanging but Amazon ain&#x27;t that.<p>Yes, there are rare occurrences where an org may try to block you from leaving. In which case, again, you are a tech employee of Amazon. You should be able to transfer to another large tech company.<p>As far as the loaner situation goes, have backbone. I&#x27;ve been asked to help out another team before. I did some research and decided I didn&#x27;t want to. I told my manager and that was that. If he really pressed, again, see the prior options.<p>Don&#x27;t be afraid to escalate. Don&#x27;t care about politics. Your manager may hate you for trying to escalate on them but what the effect of that in the long run? You only get a 1% pay increase on your 150K annual salary instead of a 5%? You have to go work for Microsoft for 150K instead of Amazon?<p>Rough oncall? Change teams.<p>Oncall but want to go places? Do it anyways. All teams should offer a hot spot. Yes, this probably means you can&#x27;t go hiking but it doesn&#x27;t mean you can&#x27;t go other places. Being oncall doesn&#x27;t really ever change my habits other than having to bring my laptop with me. Sure, if you&#x27;re on a team getting paged regularly, that won&#x27;t work but I&#x27;m not sure why you want to be on a team that gets paged regularly after hours.<p>Come on people. If you work for a FAANG company, you are a very highly paid employee in one of, if not the, hottest career field in the world. You are very likely in the top 10% of world wide salaries.

It&#x27;s the way they&#x27;re going about it and the fact that it&#x27;s a messy public &#x2F; private mix that raises ethical concerns. At some point we&#x27;re going to need to rethink an official channel for government communications. Think about it: how dependent on social media have many of us been to find out the latest public health mandates? And how well do we feel like social media deals with fake news and fraud and privacy? The combination of those two is a big problem. There needs to be a better official communications platform.<p>The US Postal Service was seen as very fundamental to the forming of its government. Now, ignoring the financial woes and plundering by Congress, and ignoring the very lousy and incompetent service you can get from it in some places, it just has fundamental limitations in cost, speed, level of non-repudiation, etc. It&#x27;s largely become a subsidized junk mail &#x2F; litter distribution network. It&#x27;s how I&#x27;m supposed to get official correspondence from the IRS, but it&#x27;s harder than it should be to know it REALLY came from the IRS, and to prove that I REALLY replied on time, and to actually work towards a resolution. We can&#x27;t use it for all our elections because of (real or not) fraud concerns so we use more inconvenient forms of voting. If you need to take someone to court you can&#x27;t trust it, so you have to pay for expensive process service. It doesn&#x27;t get used to notify me of changes in laws that affect me, like I might get fined if I go to the park with my kids tomorrow. It can&#x27;t be used to tell me that I can&#x27;t park my car where I usually do in 72 hours because of time-sensitive maintenance, we instead pay someone to put a note on my door and hope it doesn&#x27;t blow away. It&#x27;s not great. The de facto solution? Rely on NextDoor and Facebook. And we get ethical dilemmas like this article.<p>I really think at some point we need to declare some kind of Internet access a fundamental need as much as service by USPS (which is required to service every address) has been in the past, and not rely on private infrastructure for basic government services like this. As someone who tends to be libertarian and lives somewhat off-grid a lot of the time, I see the difficulties and fully expect that our government would screw up the execution of this. But at some point I think it&#x27;s necessary and inevitable to at least try.

(Consider trying to read something like ancient Hebrew in the original, written without spaces, consonants, punctuation, or lower vs uppercase - never mind italics or bolds!) Why don&#x27;t we add more? Surely we did not invent the ultimate way of writing English around 1500 AD?<p>The primary distinction seems to be that computer languages are regular enough to be machine-annotated. If you had to hand-typeset every line of code, syntax highlighting would be used only in the rarest of CS publications. (Sort of like color-coding in equations: incredibly useful pedagogically, but also so difficult to do in HTML or TeX on top of actually writing the equations that only the occasional enthusiast or particularly-determined teacher will bother.) Natural language is such a major challenge to annotate simply by part-of-speech that you need to be a linguist to do so reliably. So naturally, no one ever does, and anyone who might want to is deterred by the fact that no one else does so readers won&#x27;t understand or like it. (Beginning programmers are often confused or distracted by syntax highlighting as well.)<p>However, when you look at the best grammar&#x2F;style checkers, or deep learning results on parsing natural language, it seems plausible that they&#x27;ve gotten good enough that something useful could be done with them..."],"time":["2020-05-21 17:03:35"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["wanderingstan"],"id":[23259017],"kids":{},"parent":[23257280],"text":["As someone who loves coding and design, this was a very fun read.<p>But in all seriousness, the visual design of code these days feels archaic.

We gave an overview of its main ideas and a tour of its built-in features, demonstrated its simplicity and ease of use with several examples, and proved rigorously that it is equally as powerful as other languages and significantly more colorful.<p>&gt; In particular, we believe it will appeal to many types of students who may not have an interest in traditional text-based programming, including painters, graphic designers, and the illiterate.<p>&gt; An obvious limitation of WysiScript in its current form is the restriction, imposed by the RGB color model, that a single program can have at most 16,777,216 different user-defined variables and functions. This hinders the use of WysiScript for census-taking in the Netherlands, for example, because the Dutch population is 16,979,729. Future versions of the language may relax this restriction by adding support for additional colors not representable in RGB, such as ultraviolet, infrared, and plaid.<p>&gt; In order to support quantum computing, which makes use of value superposition and probabilistic algorithms, future versions of WysiScript may make use of the alpha channel in color specifications."],"time":["2020-05-21 19:58:46"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["zokier"],"id":[23259222],"kids":[23260290],"parent":[23257280],"text":["While this is obvious joke, I think there is speckle of a idea there too.
