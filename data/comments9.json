Governance is important, we do need better governance, and we need to cultivate virtue and responsibility in citizens and leaders. That&#x27;s all true but it&#x27;s also kind of obvious. That things go to crap if society is run by private interest, greed or straight up clowns seems self-evident.<p>But every time someone brings up old ideas, in this case Plato&#x27;s philospher caste, there&#x27;s an immediate question. If it is so great, and if it worked in the 19th century, why did it die out? Good things don&#x27;t vanish randomly.

Xi himself was cast to the countryside for years, people who make it to the top have to proof themselves over and over, and punishment can be quite harsh.

I&#x27;m shocked that standards for writing have dropped so low.<p>Consider this paragraph:<p>&gt; Democracy’s fetishisation of freedom inevitably gives way to anarchy. Fathers pander to their sons, teachers to their pupils, humans to animals, and ‘the minds of the citizens become so sensitive that the least vestige of restraint is resented as intolerable’. Anarchy produces class struggle, as the poor attack the rich and the rich retaliate; class struggle produces war and disorder. When all this becomes intolerable the masses will turn to a dictator who can restore order.<p>It&#x27;s meaningless! Democracy apparently makes &quot;humans pander to animals.&quot; Why does this happen? Just because! The author spits out this weird gob of nonsense and continues as if he&#x27;s made a real argument that democracy always leads to anarchy (which, confusingly, leads to class conflict, and not the other way around).<p>He does mention uneducated voters making bad decisions earlier, but that&#x27;s a whole other can of worms that he never even digs into (i.e. can we fix this with education reforms, or by introducing new journalistic standards into media?). He just throws it out there as if it&#x27;s all the proof he needs that only &quot;wise elites&quot; can save us from ourselves.<p>How about this part:<p>&gt; Thus the paradox at the heart of tyranny: even though tyrants have absolute power over other people, they have no power over themselves. Slaves to their own passions – ‘ill-governed’ in their own souls as Plato puts it – they use their positions to inflict those passions on the entire population. A tyranny is a psycho-drama in which everyone is caught up in the tyrant’s raging ego.<p>This is flatly untrue. Let&#x27;s look at some of the greatest tyrants of the 21st century. Xi Jinping, Vladmir Putin, the Saudis... we could go on. Are any of these people particularly prone to temper tantrums? &quot;Slaves of their own passions&quot;? No! They&#x27;re ruthless, disciplined, and experts at consolidating and leveraging power. This weird psychoanalysis of authoritarianism has no basis in fact -- it&#x27;s just storytelling.<p>Finally, scraping away the abysmal analysis, we get the actual argument:<p>&gt; The metaphor of the ship is a way of driving home Plato’s wider point about the importance of ‘guardians’. Plato argues that a successful republic is run by a class of people whose job it is to think about the long-term success of the polis.<p>The trouble with this is that putting a discreet class of people in charge of society leads to those people acting in their own interests. The whole motivating reason behind democracy is for the public to have a veto on their leadership so that leaders can&#x27;t act in their own interest. The author&#x27;s solution is &quot;let&#x27;s educate our leaders not to act in their own interest,&quot; but that&#x27;s practically a childish suggestion. What part of history has ever suggested that you can educate humans out of their innate instinct to act in self-interest?The author provides basically no real examples. Who gets to decide how these rulers are educated? The rulers? Wow I&#x27;m sure we can trust them not to act in their self-interest in that regard. After all, they &quot;educated&quot; themselves not to.<p>They did include a couple vague gestures at evidence:<p>&gt; Benjamin Jowett, the master of Balliol from 1870 until his death in 1893, devoted his life to two great projects: producing a definitive edition of Plato and turning his college into a production line for Platonic guardians.<p>&gt; [...]<p>&gt; There was a certain amount of priggishness in the cult of Plato. But it nevertheless produced an elite that was remarkably public spirited by today’s standards: too dignified to put its fingers in the cookie jar and too well-educated to be blown hither and thither by the latest intellectual fads. The old elite didn’t hog publicity for the sake of publicity – most of them were happy to work in the background without any public credit – and they wouldn’t dream of piling up vast private fortunes. This was a world of modest but tasteful cottages in the country, not swanky apartments in Belgravia or Manhattan. Dignified public service was its own reward.<p>But again, that says nothing. Who exactly are we referring to here? Which individuals led so well? By which metrics? How do they compare against other leaders? No actual evidence, just a bunch of emotionally-loaded language. The period in question (19th century England) was absolutely abysmal for workers&#x27; rights, by the way. It was the workers&#x27; movement -- a grassroots populist movement -- that ultimately led to pro-worker reforms. Not &quot;wise Platonic leaders.&quot;<p>TL;DR this article doesn&#x27;t make any real arguments, and relies on emotionally-loaded language and appeals to the nobility of elites rather than the material conditions of history."],"time":["2020-09-10 01:10:20"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["Kednicma"],"id":[24427091],"kids":[24427450,24429002],"parent":[24410627],"text":["Right, we need a tough-guy philosopher-king who wrestles his opponents into submission."],"time":["2020-09-10 01:18:45"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["calvinmorrison"],"id":[24422812],"kids":[24423097,24422914,24422991,24422952,24423086,24422875,24422905,24423396,24423616,24423191,24422975,24423088,24423406],"parent":[24422368],"text":["At the core, google and other companies sell your data for advertisements, at best, at worst they&#x27;re sending it all the NSA or some other black box.<p>I recommend everyone BUY A DOMAIN.

The light green lines are adiabats -- air rising or falling will follow along these lines until water condenses.  The big red line is temperature, and the big green one is dewpoint temperature -- where the lines touch there&#x27;s a cloud.<p>So what we have here are large inversion layers, where temperature increases with height.  Normally, the red line goes mostly straight up the graphy, as lowering pressure should lower temperature of air. And indeed, this creates a cap, where air above and below the edge of the inversion gets trapped.<p>These huge inversions are why the smoke is largely staying above the ground.  It rises hot from the fire, but any sinking would be countered by the buoyance of the air wanting to keep it up.  Mixing at the boundary layer is slow with this strong of an inversion.<p>But the inversion is also low, which means that the temperature differences with altitude can be extreme.  I&#x27;m on the coast in Ventura, but if you went up the hills in the same city, it would be 30°F&#x2F;17°C warmer at the same time.  And in LA, the 100-120°F highs a couple days ago.  We&#x27;re having Santa Ana winds that are literally blowing over the top of calm air below, because the pressure gradient is too weak to overcome the strong inversion.

Not badly, he said, just a little when you shoved hard on them. I warned him not to use his adjustable wrench on the tightening nuts. It was likely to damage the chrome and start small rust spots. He agreed to use my metric sockets and box-ends.<p>When he brought his motorcycle over I got my wrenches out but then noticed that no amount of tightening would stop the slippage, because the ends of the collars were pinched shut.<p>&quot;You’re going to have to shim those out,&quot; I said.<p>&quot;What’s shim?&quot;<p>&quot;It’s a thin, flat strip of metal. You just slip it around the handlebar under the collar there and it will open up the collar to where you can tighten it again. You use shims like that to make adjustments in all kinds of machines.&quot;<p>&quot;Oh,&quot; he said. He was getting interested. &quot;Good. Where do you buy them?&quot;<p>&quot;I’ve got some right here,&quot; I said gleefully, holding up a can of beer in my hand.<p>He didn’t understand for a moment. Then he said, &quot;What, the can?&quot;<p>&quot;Sure,&quot; I said, &quot;best shim stock in the world.&quot;<p>I thought this was pretty clever myself. Save him a trip to God knows where to get shim stock. Save him time. Save him money.<p>But to my surprise he didn’t see the cleverness of this at all. In fact he got noticeably haughty about the whole thing. Pretty soon he was dodging and filling with all kinds of excuses and, before I realized what his real attitude was, we had decided not to fix the handlebars after all.<p>As far as I know those handlebars are still loose. And I believe now that he was actually offended at the time. I had had the nerve to propose repair of his new eighteen-hundred dollar BMW, the pride of a half-century of German mechanical finesse, with a piece of old beer can!<p>Ach, du lieber!<p>Since then we have had very few conversations about motorcycle maintenance. None, now that I think of it.<p>You push it any further and suddenly you are angry, without knowing why.<p>I should say, to explain this, that beer-can aluminum is soft and sticky, as metals go. Perfect for the application. Aluminum doesn’t oxidize in wet weather...or, more precisely, it always has a thin layer of oxide that prevents any further oxidation. Also perfect.<p>In other words, any true German mechanic, with a half-century of mechanical finesse behind him, would have concluded that this particular solution to this particular technical problem was perfect.<p>For a while I thought what I should have done was sneak over to the workbench, cut a shim from the beer can, remove the printing and then come back and tell him we were in luck, it was the last one I had, specially imported from Germany. That would have done it. A special shim from the private stock of Baron Alfred Krupp, who had to sell it at a great sacrifice. Then he would have gone gaga over it.<p>That Krupp’s-private-shim fantasy gratified me for a while, but then it wore off and I saw it was just being vindictive. In its place grew that old feeling I’ve talked about before, a feeling that there’s something bigger involved than is apparent on the surface. You follow these little discrepancies long enough and they sometimes open up into huge revelations. There was just a feeling on my part that this was something a little bigger than I wanted to take on without thinking about it, and I turned instead to my usual habit of trying to extract causes and effects to see what was involved that could possibly lead to such an impasse between John’s view of that lovely shim and my own. This comes up all the time in mechanical work. A hang-up. You just sit and stare and think, and search randomly for new information, and go away and come back again, and after a while the unseen factors start to emerge.<p>What emerged in vague form at first and then in sharper outline was the explanation that I had been seeing that shim in a kind of intellectual, rational, cerebral way in which the scientific properties of the metal were all that counted. John was going at it immediately and intuitively, grooving on it. I was going at it in terms of underlying form. He was going at it in terms of immediate appearance. I was seeing what the shim meant. He was seeing what the shim was. That’s how I arrived at that distinction. And when you see what the shim is, in this case, it’s depressing. Who likes to think of a beautiful precision machine fixed with an old hunk of junk?<p>-- Robert M.

While the Swedish Corona strategy is not explicitly designed to be contrarian at the world stage (and therefor get a lot of attention), the way Swedish mono-culture works is that the people who implement policy (as well as many citizens) chauvinistically and subconsciously believe that Sweden is somehow superior to other nations and at the same time believe that Sweden (as an exceptional country) has something to teach inferior countries (i.e all other countries).<p>So where we are right now is that we have this unhealthy feedback loop where Sweden initially did it&#x27;s own thing, and as it turned out to be different that has been a signal to policy makers that Sweden is right. Because Sweden is exceptional, so if the policy is different from inferior countries (i.e all other countries), it must be right.<p>I wish, probably more than anything else, that other countries would just stop giving Swedish policy makers this attention because then maybe, hopefully, our politicians can start to do what&#x27;s right for our citizens instead of what gets attention and talking points at the world stage.<p>This is far broader than Corona: Sweden gets way too much attention overall, because Swedish politicians and government communication employees have nailed &quot;marketing&quot; more than anything else. They crave this attention and they manufacture policy to get attention, at the expense of the people who live in the country. Often under the guise of marketing Sweden as a &quot;moral super power&quot;, superior to other nations.<p>So please, if you are for example a left leaning American, please don&#x27;t use Sweden as a political piece.

Now the virus is less deadly because there are fewer people left who are vulnerable to it.<p>At the start of the pandemic Anders Tegnel, the architect of Sweden&#x27;s response to the virus, did not believe that asymptomatic carriers existed [1], so Sweden&#x27;s Public Health Agency instructed health workers in care homes to only stay at home if they had symptoms and to not wear any PPE at work [2]. So they carried the virus into the care homes and a hecatomb of old people ensued.<p>Obviously, now that the most vulnerable are gone, the virus kills many fewer patients. Swedes don&#x27;t even need to have immunity to the virus, as such. They just need to be young and healthy enough to survive it if they get it. Not so much heard immunity, as herd culling.<p>For comparison, let&#x27;s take Greece, where I&#x27;m from and which is a country with a similar population to that of Sweden (about 10 million each). Greece imposed a draconian lockdown in early March, as soon as the severity of the pandemic became obvious (we are right next to Italy, after all). The result was about ~2500 infections and ~140 dead by 1st July when the lockdown was lifted [3]. Remember, that&#x27;s in a country with a similar population as Sweden (but with a much more touchy-feely, huggy-kissy, family-dinner Mediterrannean culture than Sweden). Now we&#x27;ve opened our borders and we&#x27;re doing business (= tourism) as usual.

Multiplying the percent case increases for the high, moderate-high and moderate inflow counties by each county’s respective pre-rally cumulative COVID-19 cases and aggregating, yields a total of 263,708 additional cases in these locations due to the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally.  Adding the number of new cases due to the Rally in South Dakota estimated by synthetic control (3.6 per 1,000 population, scaled by the South Dakota population of approximately 858,000) brings the total number of cases to 266,796 or 19 percent of 1.4 million new cases.<p>&gt; If we conservatively assume that all of these cases were non-fatal, then these cases represent a cost of over $12.2 billion, based on the statistical cost of a COVID-19 case of $46,000 estimated by Kniesner and Sullivan (2020).<p>The Kniesner and Sullivan paper cited [2] gets to the value of $46,000 by using the Department of Transportation&#x27;s &quot;value per statistical life&quot; of about $10 million per death (scaled down to ~$11k per asymptomatic case), which is not a public health cost estimate. It&#x27;s probably far higher than what hospitals and the health system spends per case.<p>Not only that, but the paper claims, without any controls, that ALL case count increases in counties that sent lots of people to the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally in the weeks following it were caused by the Rally itself.

In that situation, parents may be splitting their time between watching their kids and helping with homework and working from home.  This is going to be a significant loss in terms of productivity for many people.  And also a big distraction.<p>Another aspect is just exactly what their job entails and what tools they are using.  If they have a job that involves a lot of face-to-face meetings and do not have a very good video chat software setup or have significant issues with internet, that is going to be a big loss for them.  Or maybe their chat software works fine but there is no proper way to set up the video meetings because they haven&#x27;t created a Discord or Slack.  So if the software or internet is not not configured or working well, that can be another issue.<p>A side aspect of that is if there is a manager who feels he is supposed to directly monitor and supervise (i.e. giv orders on the fly) and is used to doing so in person, but now does not have a convenient way to do so.  That also can be resolved with software, simply by requiring people to be logged into a chat or something.

A good starting point for that is not to discourage having kids, but not particularly support it either.

This gave me a lot of work time to explore what the US looks like today, and how that has changed over the past 50 years. One of my key random personal takeaways from several years exploring carbon chains, land use, etc, a takeaway shared with several of my colleagues who already had children, was that we had previously underestimated the degree to which quality of life in post-2000 (completely aside from quality of life for other species, which is a separate topic) is negatively impacted by the increased density of people.<p>For example, and there&#x27;s lots of stories you can tell like this, many people like having access to alone time in nature, and it&#x27;s a lot harder in 2020 than it was in 1970, simply because more people in the country =&gt; less natural &#x2F; fallow land. &quot;The woods behind the neighborhood&quot; is less and less a thing.<p>As an aside, my wife and I were considering having kids until I got exposed to these viewpoints, and they changed my mind. I think its better that my brother has kids, because he REALLY REALLY wanted to have them. And that&#x27;s great.

Here&#x27;s how we do it. First of all, you can&#x27;t retire at 30 on an entry level engineer salary (poetic license taken). Second, there are no child care benefits.<p>Instead, parents with kids split things up. One parent (usually the one who was earning less anyway) dials down their career, perhaps by going part time. The other parent dials up, by competing for promotions. For instance, it&#x27;s almost like clockwork that someone announces the birth of their first child, and shortly after that, they&#x27;ve become a project- or middle-manager, or they&#x27;ve gone to work somewhere else. A few years later, when their family life stabilizes, they might come back to engineering. That&#x27;s what I did.<p>This is a known economic effect. More than half of workers will change jobs for higher pay shortly after their first kid is born. There was a study of unskilled single women in a poor neighborhood in Chicago. After adjusting for everything else, the ones with kids tended to work for higher pay, changed jobs more often, and worked further from home.<p>This is all pre-COVID of course, but is how things have worked for decades.<p>Is this a good thing? Well, it stratifies the career ladder quite noticeably. How do you make it so that people with kids aren&#x27;t running the entire show?

People are upset that those with children are given more schedule flexibility than those who do not have children. It seems like straight up jealousy. Instead of resenting parents, resent your manager and ask for ( or demand) what you want.<p>The argument that other workers need to make up for the slack left by parents does not really make sense; you just add tasks to your backlog, and do them when you have time. You should be in control of your own schedule, and don&#x27;t let your manager just extend your workday. If your manager does not respect your time and is overworking you, quit. As engineers, we are not punching a time clock. If you are, take issue with that, not the flexibility some other coworkers are getting (flexibility that they need).<p>If you also want more schedule flexibility, push for it. Talk to your manager. Organize with your fellow employees. Organize with other engineers. Start a union (gasp!).<p>Work-life balance is always a balance. Our jobs should take note of what we do outside of work and how that affects our ability to work. We are people, not mindless, identical worker bees. Our life outside of work is most likely more important to us than our life at work.<p>Having children is very much unlike most other activities in that you cannot quit. You can quit a side hustle, you can quit a sport. But you can&#x27;t quit being a parent. So when a parent turns to their boss and says &quot;I need more flexibility&quot;, the manager has to give that flexibility or the worker is going to have to find a new job that does give that flexibility. Usually capitalism will extract as much time from a worker as possible, forcing the worker to give up many things in the name of work. It&#x27;s impossible to give up your child though, so obviously capitalism has to yield there. But with better labor organization, capitalism will yield to other things too.<p>If we all want schedule flexibility and more time so badly, let&#x27;s unionize and get that.

Here is my take:<p>Ad platforms work in varying degrees for different products and companies. You should not dismiss an ad platform based on poor performance alone without understanding why it performed poorly.<p>It&#x27;s sort of like with airlines: If you boycott an airline for every minor offense, pretty soon you&#x27;ll have no option but to take the train.<p>In this case, it&#x27;s disingenuous to paint an entire ad platform--that does hundreds of millions in revenue[1]--as &quot;awash in mistaken clicks and bot traffic&quot; based on a campaign that ran for just 1.5 days and resulted in 11 clicks. (They say they saw similar results from larger campaigns, but they don&#x27;t show them.)<p>But Ok, let&#x27;s say we take out the generalizations. I get that it&#x27;s disconcerting for any company to find they were charged for traffic that bounced within a second. In that case you need to look for the root cause, and see if it can be resolved or worked around.<p>In this case the root cause should be painfully obvious to experienced marketers like the authors: Most of the 11 clicks seems to be from mobile traffic (as seen in their Fullstory report), where it is remarkably easy for users to accidentally click on an ad in their news feed. They do mention this possibility in both the video and the title, but they seem to underestimate the likelihood of this being the root cause, and talk too much about bots instead. I&#x27;ve seen this exact misclick behavior in Twitter and for that reason I stopped advertising there.<p>Unlike Twitter, however, LinkedIn lets you work around this. They offer a &quot;lead gen&quot; campaign type, which requires two clicks (one on the ad, and one more on the &quot;submit form&quot; button) and sharing of contact information before the advertiser is charged. I&#x27;ve still seen funky results from this--such as users saying they don&#x27;t recall submitting any form--but in much fewer cases than with simple image ads.<p>Today, when I run LinkedIn campaigns, it is almost always with lead gen ads. The results are <i>far<\/i> better than this anecdotal post suggests. Some issues still come up, and I&#x27;ve found that attempting to troubleshoot them leads to a better outcome for the business than dismissing the entire ad platform.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gkogan.co&#x2F;blog&#x2F;how-ad-campaigns-fail&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gkogan.co&#x2F;blog&#x2F;how-ad-campaigns-fail&#x2F;<\/a>\n[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.businessofapps.com&#x2F;data&#x2F;linkedin-statistics&#x2F;#3\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.businessofapps.com&#x2F;data&#x2F;linkedin-statistics&#x2F;#3<\/a>"],"time":["2020-09-08 16:28:36"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["josefrichter"],"id":[24408113],"kids":[24408723,24408287,24409204,24408452,24416996,24413129,24410669],"parent":[24407432],"text":["LinkedIn is the weirdest product ever.

The original idea was that the entire memory would essentially be a single address space, with segments being blocks of memory that might be in core, on disk, or on tape (called very slow storage if I remember correctly but it’s been decades). Security was at the segment level, so you could for example have (in posix parlance) an suid shared library that an ordinary program could, with appropriate authentication and permissions, call into in a controlled manner.  Multics’ permission structure was more fine grained than the binary of suid.  You can see how the backup system kind of falls out of this automatically.  I trust some multician will step up and correct any memory-corruption-based thinkos in the above.<p>Of course reality didn’t quite match the dream and Multics was cancelled before some of that research could be completed.  But if you look at the x86 segment registers they could implement something like that.  I think this was also in the intel iapx-430 but fortunately even the name of that ancient dead processor is hazy in my mind.<p>As for the alto filesystem and its descendants: the labels don’t have to be next to the blocks they describe.

If we naively multiply these numbers we get an overall 20x improvement.<p>&gt; Since 2013, JavaScript page weight has increased 3.7x from 107KB to 392KB. Maybe minification and compression have improved a bit as well, so more JavaScript code now fits into fewer bytes. Let&#x27;s round the multiple up to 6x.

I think most developers who look at user experience with respect to latency or performance today (or even ten years ago) would agree that we should not only consider the average and that we should also look at the tail. If we do so, we see that device age is increasing at the median and the tail, quite drastically in the tail even if we &quot;only&quot; look at p75 device age: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;danluu.com&#x2F;android-updates&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;danluu.com&#x2F;android-updates&#x2F;<\/a>.<p>If we consider a user who&#x27;s still using a 2013 Galaxy S4 and ask &quot;does your phone feel 5 times faster than it did in 2013?&quot;, based on some js benchmarks improving by 5x, I think they&#x27;ll laugh in our face. I&#x27;ve used a couple of Android devices that I tried to keep up to date (to the extent that&#x27;s possible on Android) and each one became unbearably slow after taking some big Android update. Those updates probably included improvements in the Android Runtime as well as V8, and yet, the net effect was not positive. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m alone in this -- if you read any forum where people discuss taking updates for the phones, one of the most common complaints is that their previously usable phone became unusable due to performance degradations caused by the update.<p>Sure, my personal user experience on my daily-driver phone is ok on my phone because I have very fast phone and I&#x27;m often using it from fast wifi. But it&#x27;s terrible if I take a road trip across the U.S. and the experience is terrible anywhere in the U.S. with an old phone. I don&#x27;t think we should just write off the experiences of people with old phones or who live in places where they can&#x27;t get high-speed internet even if life is good for people like me when I&#x27;m at home on my 1Gb connection. When I looked at this with respect to bandwidth and latency (inspired by a road trip where I found every website from a major tech company to be unusable, excluding a few Google properties), I found that, on a slow connection like you get in many places in the U.S., websites can easily take more than 1 minute to load in a controlled benchmark: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;danluu.com&#x2F;web-bloat&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;danluu.com&#x2F;web-bloat&#x2F;<\/a>.

When I travel through the U.S. on the interstate (major throughfares which will, in general, have better connectivity than analogous places off of major throughfares) most pages are so slow that they don&#x27;t even load at all, so those attempts aren&#x27;t counted in the statistics! I don&#x27;t dispute that things are getting faster for the median user or even the 75%-ile slow user if you measure that in a specific way, but there are plenty of users whose experiences are getting worse who won&#x27;t even be counted in this stat that&#x27;s in the post because their experience is too slow to even get counted in the stats."],"time":["2020-09-09 02:40:57"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["TeeMassive"],"id":[24416620],"kids":{},"parent":[24413705],"text":["&gt; Mobile page weight increased by 337% between 2013 and 2020.

The average website downloads 1.7MB of data in 2020, which will take at least 9s to download on the HTTP Archive connection.<p>I have family in an African country where the only reasonably priced home internet connection is about 56kbps over DSL (yes, dialup speeds over DSL, very confusing). Web pages have gone from very slow to unusable very quick.<p>I believe and appreciate that the users most people target have faster devices now, especially in the core hubs of Web development like Silicon Valley. However, this trend of &quot;we can fit more data in because devices are faster&quot; is horrible for anyone already behind in available technology or even on a limited data plan.<p>My father uses my old smartphone, a Oneplus One with the latest release of LineageOS. This device runs a Qualcom 801, a chip that was considered to have flagship speeds t the time of its release. WiFi speeds are over 100mbps, but websites and applications are still getting slow somehow.<p>Even a mid-range or cheap smartphone has a better GPU than older devices, and there are many of those out there. The advice to test on budget smartphones is solid, but people often go out and buy a new cheap phone instead of using something that was popular a few years ago. People who can&#x27;t afford or don&#x27;t see the value in getting a new S20 don&#x27;t necessarily have cheap smartphones, they often have second hand phones or hand-me-downs as well. Frameworks like Flutter and browser engines using canvas are very noticeably slow on those older devices because of the advancements GPU tech has made, as CPU tech improvements in smartphones have begun to slow down over the years.<p>Is the web slower? No, not for the people you want to sell your product to. The question is, why should we accept this bloat? Web applications can be as slow as you want to make them with festures and pretty designs for all I care, but the web in general doesn&#x27;t need two megabytes of javascript to render a manual or a forum post. The metrics discussed here are wrong in the context they were originally used in, so the article does have a point. However, I don&#x27;t think we should say the web hasn&#x27;t gotten slower because computers have increased speeds to compensate with the load. Every byte you save, every script you ignore, every image you compress can have significant impact on hundreds of millions of not billions. If you can&#x27;t justify that to your team lead, use the argument that the less resources you use, the better the users&#x27; battery lives are and the more responsive a site feels. The impact is about the same."],"time":["2020-09-09 08:17:39"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":{},"id":[24414728],"kids":{},"parent":[24413705],"text":{},"time":["2020-09-09 01:11:11"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["bobloblaw45"],"id":[24414733],"kids":{},"parent":[24413705],"text":["Give almost any local news website a shot.

(I didn&#x27;t even know LinkedIn offered it.)<p>Also, the workflow was utterly bizarre for me running on macOS Catalina in Safari. I clicked on &quot;Login with LinkedIn&quot; and it opened a smaller window with no address bar and asked for my LinkedIn credentials. I entered them and it loaded LinkedIn in this small window. Was it supposed to go to SlideShare? I went back to the SlideShare window and reloaded, but I still wasn&#x27;t logged in, despite what others here have reported. I had to go back to the login page, do the whole thing again, then reload, and finally I was actually logged in.

The school had an account with a local timesharing computer company, and for a mere $30 per hour ($200&#x2F;hour in today&#x27;s dollars) you could dial in and <i>run a BASIC program<\/i>.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Time-sharing\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Time-sharing<\/a><p>Naturally my first program was:<p><pre><code>  10 PRINT &quot;HELLO&quot;\n<\/code><\/pre>\nand it printed HELLO!<p>You can probably guess the next line I added to the program:<p><pre><code>  20 GOTO 10\n<\/code><\/pre>\nWhoops! This wasn&#x27;t just text scrolling on a screen, it printed out line after line on the roll of Teletype paper. Had to hang up the dialup modem fast.<p>That summer I got a job as &quot;night operator&quot; at the timesharing company (Transdata in Phoenix, AZ). The great thing about this job was they shut down the timesharing service at night. So I had their SDS Sigma 5 all to myself. My first personal computer!<p>I found a copy of the Algol-60 Report and taught myself Algol. And then Sigma 5 machine language. It was great fun to see how much of a program I could write on a single punch card (80 bytes).<p>We had a nice single-card program that you could put in front of a deck of cards to print out the whole card deck. But it was kind of slow, because it would read a card, print the card, read the next card, print that one, etc.<p>There were a few bytes left on that print program card, so I squeezed in code for a double buffer. It would read the first card, start it printing, and then <i>while it printed<\/i> read in the next card, overlapping the reads and writes so it printed twice as fast.<p>That fall I went to Caltech, lasted a year and flunked out. I loved science and math, but when we got to partial differential equations my mind just couldn&#x27;t handle it. But there was a systems programming class, and the final project was to write an infix expression parser and evaluator with operator precedence in assembly language.<p>I was the only person in the class to turn in a complete working program with test cases. I could probably tell you exactly where I was sitting when the instructor announced the results. I had found my calling, and have been at it ever since.<p>My secret weapon: while everyone was punching cards with their program, submitting the batch job, and waiting hours or overnight for the core dump when it crashed, I found an <i>interactive console<\/i> on campus where I could code and run and test my program in real time. Just like the Teletype I learned on.<p>Moving forward to the present, I interviewed with a FAANG company last week. It reminded me a bit of the discouraging experience the article&#x27;s author initially had with LOGO and competitive programming.<p>Everyone I interviewed with, and the company recruiters, were all super nice and supportive. But the gist of the interview process was to tackle four medium to hard algorithm problems and come up with not only a working solution but a perfectly optimized solution, in 15 minutes each!<p>The recruiters advised me to spend at least an hour or two every day for two weeks on LeetCode banging through as many algorithm problems as I could, timing myself to see if I could solve each one with optimized code in that 15 minute time limit.<p>There was also a system design interview focused on scaling out a backend system to support a billion users. I explained to the recruiter and the interviewer that this wasn&#x27;t my forte, but I had a lot of experience with low level hardware interfaces and was really interested in a job in their hardware group. They don&#x27;t hire for a specific role like that, though, they hire &quot;generalist engineers&quot;, which means being able to come up with a fully optimized solution for any algorithm in 15 minutes - and without the ability to <i>run and test your code<\/i>.<p>In fact, they used an online code editor that normally lets you do just that, but this capability was disabled. I suppose they were trying to limit the online editor to match the capabilities of what you could do scribbling code on a whiteboard.<p>This all reminded me of what discouraged the OP&#x27;s author so much about his initial foray into programming: the competitive coding competition with LOGO. That is fun for some people, but not for him and not for me. I would rather learn how to <i>cooperate<\/i> with other programmers, not compete with them.<p>One of the algorithm problems stuck in my mind. Of course it was a LeetCode problem that you can read about here:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;leetcode.com&#x2F;problems&#x2F;valid-palindrome-ii&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;leetcode.com&#x2F;problems&#x2F;valid-palindrome-ii&#x2F;<\/a><p>&quot;Given a non-empty string s, you may delete at most one character. Judge whether you can make it a palindrome.&quot;<p>In Python, there is a simple solution for this:<p><pre><code>  def is_palindrome_with_at_most_one_character_deleted( string ):\n      if string == string[::-1]:\n          return True\n      for i in range( len(string) ):\n          s = string[:i] + string[i+1:]\n          if s == s[::-1]:\n              return True\n      return False\n<\/code><\/pre>\nIf the string slice notation is unfamiliar, here are some references:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?q=python+slice+notation\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?q=python+slice+notation<\/a><p>But of course this simple solution would not be good enough. What about the time complexity?<p>This LeetCode problem has 520,862 submissions at the moment, with 191,325 accepted. The solution above would not be accepted.<p>There is a faster solution, but it is less obvious and prone to off by one errors and other logic errors. It&#x27;s not <i>that<\/i> complicated, but not something I would expect anyone to code correctly and verify in 15 minutes.<p>If that kind of competitive programming was what programming looked like to me, I could see myself being easily as discouraged as the OP was.<p>Fortunately there are other fish to catch in this grand ocean of programming!"],"time":["2020-09-08 08:06:12"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["markus_zhang"],"id":[24409452],"kids":{},"parent":[24404628],"text":["I&#x27;m on the same boat.<p>Kind of weird (and again in the same boat as OP) as I was probably among the few in my country to actually have access to a brand new IBM PC back in the late 80s as my father got it from the university as part of the research grant. Most of my friends were lucky to own a NES at that time.

The process of getting a coding job has gotten extremely hard and demanding. 5-8 years back it was solely based on the interview; if you knew your stuff and could talk-the-talk, they&#x27;d generally take a chance you could walk-the-walk.<p>Now, it&#x27;s gotten extremely unreasonable. Mostly in the &#x27;code-challenges&#x27; being asked. I recently was given an challenge and after they gave me a small overview of it, I asked roughly what the time-box should be to get a feel for what they thought the effort take. The hiring manager said to me &#x27;it shouldn&#x27;t take more than 8 hours&#x27;. I was shocked. I&#x27;ve been given many coding challenges, they generally fall into the 2 hours or less category. 8 hours is a serious time commitment. I ended up passing because if this is what they find reasonable during the interview I can&#x27;t imagine what kind of demands they&#x27;d place on me day-in-day out.<p>That&#x27;s just one recent example. Before that I was asked to write a simple todo list, and given a time box of 2 days. In that case I chose to do it because I knew I could do something like that in way less than 2 days. I ended up using the full 2 days just sprucing up the UX.  I ended up not getting an offer from that company because I bombed the 2 hour group interview which I knew would happen; our family pet had been suddenly ill and in the ICU for 4 days straight and my wife and I had maybe 8 hours of sleep over the previous 5 days. Of course I tried to reschedule but the technical recruiter was adamant this last interview was just a formality, they loved my star-wars themed todo list (Jedi-Do, it&#x27;s on my github: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;LowRezSkyline&#x2F;Jedi_Do\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;LowRezSkyline&#x2F;Jedi_Do<\/a>) and an offer was pending.<p>So it&#x27;s one thing to learn programming and quite another to get through the crazy gate-keeping happening these days and land an actual job.

They are not in the pursuit of truth, that is not what the court establishes. If a litigator is on the receiving end of public outrage for things like the absolutely insane assertions by the prosecution, they take it as credit for doing their job. This professional contempt for truth and principle outside the narrow constraints of  legalism is what gives lawyers the reputation for being  assholes, and what makes some of them insufferable when their work habits bleed into their personal lives.<p>The trouble in this case that I read from these updates is that the judge is clearly acting like a second prosecutor. I blame it on a generation of people who don&#x27;t understand impartiality, and who see it as a weakness because they don&#x27;t need to be impartial if they &quot;know&quot; what they are encountering. Once they have internalized the notion of history as progress, attacks on levers and institutions that can facilitate it are attacks on progress itself. They are litigating ideology, and law is just a host or vehicle.

We pushed extremely hard to get into new markets, and while strategically this worked out extremely well for us, it meant that later development was hamstrung by earlier decisions.

While I do think prioritizing new markets early on was a good call, that mindset bit us in the ass in a big way when we tried to ship a very flashy new feature later in our growth cycle that crashed and burned because of tech debt, and it took us over a year to fix everything to release it.

There may be no difference, and your strategy is to ship features in order satisfy each new customer as you get it. Perhaps you can design for that. Chances are though that your first customers are not wholly repsentative of your strategic, target market.<p>So, in the early stage, you have to make  choices about allocating dev for tactical &quot;now&quot; or for strategic  &quot;later&quot;. In the early stage, if there is not enough &quot;now&quot;, there is no &quot;later&quot;. The question is when to begin budget for later. I&#x27;ll argue that you are attempting to build a business, not a suspense movie, and that you budget a fixed amount for &quot;later&quot; from day one. Plan to succeed.<p>I agree with the recommendation of a strong Professional Services function as an buffer for dev, but will note that culturally you have to work hard to not silo. Your Support and ProServe teams become a primary channel of learning for dev. As a business, though, you may have to give away ProServ hours.<p>All in all my biggest takeaway here is that you attempt to &quot;hire&quot; customers strategically. As you journey together, will this customer want to go where you will want to go? What time is it when your &quot;Big Customer&quot; sits on your roadmap? ...<p>&quot;Hire&quot; customers strategically is easier said than done when there&#x27;s salaries on the line -- accordingly look at how you compensate Sales and budget away from early stage big deals."],"time":["2020-09-08 20:31:34"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["hn_throwaway_99"],"id":[24410148],"kids":[24410469],"parent":[24390362],"text":["Also could be titled &quot;Hidden costs of moving to microservices because the cool kids are.&quot;<p>Very glad (most of) the cool kids have re-evaluated their stance on microservices."],"time":["2020-09-08 18:44:02"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":{},"id":[24411973],"kids":{},"parent":[24390362],"text":{},"time":["2020-09-08 21:22:10"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["pkteison"],"id":[24409699],"kids":[24410010],"parent":[24390362],"text":["What an awful article.
