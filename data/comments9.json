Machine learning has struggled in early stage drug discovery efforts because most of these efforts do not have enough data for the models to parse. Our technology solves the data problem with massively parallel biochemistry in the form of DNA Encoded Libraries (DELs), allowing us to analyze 100-1000x more compounds compared to traditional approaches. By feeding our algorithms with this data we can identify better compounds faster than competing solutions. We recently closed a substantial seed investment (2+ years runway) and are assembling a highly interdisciplinary team of both bench and computational scientists. Come help us build the future of drug discovery!<p>Lead ML Engineer: We are looking for our first computational hire who in time will help build and manage this team. This person will be driving technology choices, designing and building data architectures and building models. These systems will take in raw experimental data as well as other information from lab instruments and integrate that data into models predicting several biochemically relevant properties. Familiarity with current ML and data pipeline tools is a must. We favor python, but aren’t dogmatic.<p>Computational Chemist: We are looking for a computational chemist to create a cutting edge drug discovery toolchain. We strongly favor open platforms such as RDKit but are open to alternatives that maximize performance. This person should be familiar with traditional SAR, structure based drug discovery, ADME prediction and have some exposure to more recent ML applications to drug discovery.<p>These roles are both asking a lot, and correspondingly we offer strong equity and competitive compensation. The roles are also a unique opportunity to build systems correctly from the ground up to solve a really important problem!<p>Odds and ends:<p>Interview process is generally a few phone&#x2F;video conversations and some small practicum work, but is adapted to the individual at this stage of the company.<p>Onsite is expected to be in Dogpatch, SF but will likely shift to South San Francisco in the future.

The informational complexity of an OS installation was defined by the skill of the package managers.  You would rely on them to make smart decisions, which would be codified in the <i>debian&#x2F;<\/i> directory alongside the original source, in the dpkg sources themselves.<p>All that feels by the wayside nowadays.  The <i>information<\/i> about my site installation is all in a set of ansible playbooks.  They could blast their way through an installation of any modern Linux OS and the result would look like an horrendous mess to a sysadmin from the 90s, but who cares?  It’s still as reproducible as the carefully tended garden that was a Debian installation of the old days, but with the advantage that whenever the install drifts into instability you can just nuke everything and rebuild from scratch.<p>In fact, it’s all so automated, if you aren’t regularly blasting everything away and reinstalling, you’re doing it wrong.<p>No longer do I have a gigabyte or more of backups representing my ossified Debian install as a fallback.  Instead I have a few kB of YAML and ansible to build everything.<p>Case in point.  Debian 10 ships with LXC 3.  If I want LXC 4 I just script the build and installation.  The script is what needs backing up.  The OS is disposable.  In the past I might have taken care to .&#x2F;configure to install in &#x2F;opt but why bother?  It’s more work (LD_LIBRARY_PATH needs setting) so just blast it into &#x2F;use&#x2F;bin and don’t lose sleep over treading on Debian’s carefully pedicured toes.  If it doesn’t work out, reimage and try something else. It’s wonderfully transient.<p>I miss the old days, but I embrace the controlled chaos, volatility, and dynamism of the future.  I can do what I want instead of what, in the last, was carefully curated for me by expert Debian maintainers.

For the last one, you can avoid layout shift by e.g. reserving space for images that are yet to load fully.<p>For example, it sounds like your page could load 100MB of images with the most complex design ever, and it would get a good score as long as the initial viewport of the page displays quickly, is interactive quickly, and doesn&#x27;t jump around as it&#x27;s loading.<p>They sound reasonable metrics to me in terms of fighting bloat but with flexibility for web developers (as opposed to AMP).

I would like to touch to some of the points here, as the arguments of the article were not very clear to me:<p>&gt; The simple assumption that it is always better to have the smallest page possible – that images should be resized and compressed to hell and typography&#x2F;other elements should be few in number.\nI strongly agree with this statement overall, and the article doesn&#x27;t seem to provide any counter-arguments against it. We need to serve the smallest page possible because the larger the page, the more resources it consumes, it is that simple. Every _unnecessary_ byte added to a page literally translates to more storage for the page, more processing power to prepare the page, more data being sent on the wire, more data on the client-side to interpret the given data, and all these add up to more energy being used to consume that page and more resources being wasted. If I can remove one byte from a page, this is for sure a win for everyone, one byte is one byte, whether that saving is relevant considering the scale and the effort is a whole another discussion, and the claim was never &quot;send the smallest page at all costs&quot;. Considering the time and effort, if there is a way to send a smaller page, then do it, it is no different than turning the lamp off of an empty room, just on a different scale.<p>&gt; Instantaneous page loads should be priority over any other standards of measure for a web page – like interesting design, for instance.\nI have never seen such a claim anywhere before, needs citation. As a developer, I think the look and the feel of the pages are as important as performance or efficiency, and web on its own can be used as an art platform, which would make this whole point irrelevant. Again, the overall point is this: if you can offer the same thing with smaller pages witha reasonable amount of effort, do it.<p>&gt; Minimalistic design is necessary.\nI have never seen such a claim, needs citation. As a user, I prefer cleaner design over fancier things, but this is neither a &quot;rule&quot; nor the industry standard. There are various research being done on this topic and I am no expert on it, but a joint research [1] done by University of Basel and Google&#x2F;YouTube User Experience Research shows that the users perceive the cleaner designs as more beautiful, making the point that if the user perception is a goal for the given webpage, then keeping things simple might actually make a difference there. Again, depends on the use-case.<p>&gt; 22.82 Mbps will reliably download very complex web pages nearly instantaneously\nThis is a pain I am living with every day. I have a 4 year old mobile phone with 6GB of RAM, and it takes at least 8-10 seconds for Medium to be usable over a ~100Mbps connection, combined with fetching the page and rendering &#x2F; interpreting it. This is exactly the point I was making above, if the page was smaller, it would have actually made a difference of seconds. The same device over the same connection at the same time opens the bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com in under a second, so, there is something to be seen there.<p>In addition to that, even if I had 1Ghz connection, a 1-byte waste is a waste, irrelevant of my connection speed. I am not talking of the effort of saving that byte, but it is important to acknowledge the waste.<p>&gt; Google has the right to dictate “Best Practices.”\nThis is a point that I agree with more than the other ones, but this seems to be a separate topic to me. The previous arguments were against the practices themselves, and this one is against the entity that is supplying those practices. Even though I agree with the majority of the points there, it would have been a more informative read if the claims and frustrations there were stated with better point-by-point explanations and data to back those claims up. Google having a huge power and monopoly to push people to certain standards is a big problem, but it is not clear in the article whether the author is arguing against the practices or Google itself.<p>Overall, I believe it would have been a more resourceful article if the points and claims against the given practices were backed by better alternatives and data. We all accept that more data is more processing power + more energy, therefore trying to minimize it is an important goal, if the author thinks it should not be, then would be more interested in the answer of &quot;why?&quot; rather than a rant against long-standing practices."],"time":["2020-06-02 00:27:23"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["verdverm"],"id":[23383708],"kids":[23384664],"parent":[23383548],"text":["This is the best place I know of to have thoughtful discussions and talk about what most consider taboo.<p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.paulgraham.com&#x2F;say.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.paulgraham.com&#x2F;say.html<\/a><p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.paulgraham.com&#x2F;resay.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.paulgraham.com&#x2F;resay.html<\/a><p>There are times where it gets heated, but those are quickly shut down by the very excellent community moderation."],"time":["2020-06-01 22:55:29"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["habanany"],"id":[23384084],"kids":{},"parent":[23383548],"text":["Actually is de demon, unfortunately not good alternative"],"time":["2020-06-01 23:26:55"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["habanany"],"id":[23384093],"kids":{},"parent":[23383548],"text":["Google the demon, unfortunately no better alernative"],"time":["2020-06-01 23:27:41"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["BurningFrog"],"id":[23381834],"kids":[23381899,23381969,23387095,23382210],"parent":[23379910],"text":["Just so we know what we&#x27;re talking about, here is a description of the 13 Qualified Immunity cases that may get to the Supreme Court soon.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cato.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;may-15th-supreme-court-will-finally-decide-whether-hear-cases-calling-abolition-qualified\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cato.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;may-15th-supreme-court-will-finall...<\/a><p>Sample:<p><i>Jessop v.

It&#x27;s interesting to see how the interpersonal dynamics among the Justices influence decisions.<p>An example of this is looking for unanimous decisions to send a strong message, whether it is for school desegregation:<p>&gt; <i>Since 1954, the Court had always been unanimous in school cases, its strong commands to desegregate joined by every member. For fifteen years, the Justices had agreed that it was essential to let the South know that not a single Justice believed in anything less than full desegregation.<\/i><p>or to reject Nixon&#x27;s executive privilege claims in Watergate [2]:<p>&gt; <i>The Nixon challenge had to be met in the strongest way possible. An eight-signature opinion would do it [...] The country would benefit from such a show of strength now.<\/i><p>These decisions required significant reconciliation between the original ideas of the Justices. They don&#x27;t operate in a vacuum of law study. The Muhammad Ali draft dodging case [3] also demonstrates this, where a 4-4 deadlock is turned into a unanimous 8-0 decision centered around a technical error which would not set precedent - the book describes Burger as considering that &quot;it might be interpreted as a racist vote&quot; if he dissented.<p>Like the link, I am also curious about why these delays have occurred, especially the most recent one. Wildly speculating, maybe the Court does not want to appear too politically activist in this moment; or maybe the members are trying to find consensus for their preferred outcome before granting cert at all.

We need reform of how abuses by law enforcement are handled.  Many things could be done besides and in addition to relaxing qualified immunity.  For example: send all cases to the States&#x27; Attorneys General rather than to the local district attorneys -- district attorneys have to work closely with police, so they have social barriers to effectively policing the police.  Another thing is that being placed on desk duty or off duty with pay is abusive when it turns out the behavior was a fireable offense or criminal, so the officer should have to pay back that pay or simply not get it to begin with.  Another thing is that police need to be trained in stepping in to their partner&#x27;s business and halt brutality (preferably before it crosses the line) -- again, there are social problems here -the blue wall- that make this difficult, so maybe, too, change partners often.<p>Also, normally, when someone gets charged with a crime, the Speedy Trial clock begins running immediately (or at arraignment), so it&#x27;s unwise to charge persons before the State is ready to try the case, and filing charges only to later drop them due to being baseless in retrospect is problematic, but perhaps for LEO there could be a notice of intent to charge whose purpose is to signal to the public that the State intends to charge the LEO if they can find enough evidence to go to trial with.<p>We need to get serious about dealing with police brutality and the system&#x27;s inability to deal with it effectively.

I was trying to read numbers on houses, then I saw flashing red and blue lights ahead and knew where my prospective passenger would be found.<p>A police officer was on watch outside; his colleague was inside wrapping things up. The police officer told me the family had called for an intervention. The fire department had already departed, as Grandpa had declined medical assistance.<p>I asked what the story was. The police officer said simply &quot;probably meth&quot;, and pointed out the right to refuse medical care is fundamental. I was supposed to take Grandpa to a motel.<p>At one point in our interaction, the police officer pointed out that it takes different kinds of cops to work in Scottsdale (for example), where some drunk kid might have a prestigious lawyer as their parent, vs. his ghetto precinct, where it&#x27;s a point of pride to have &#x27;taken a swing at a cop&#x27;.<p>Eventually Grandpa came out and got in my cab, the two police officers departed... Then grandpa wanted his son&#x27;s phone number. I started the meter and pulled forward a few feet to where his son was standing. He got the phone number, then a woman appeared... She said they just wanted him to get help, Grandpa said &quot;I just want to get some rest...&quot; &quot;oh, you can rest here...&quot; My passenger&#x27;s son paid me $6 for the 20 feet, and that was the end of that.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of collateral damage in policing... Many other passengers had stories of being pointlessly harmed through their interactions with the police. One white fellow let his medical marijuana card expire. One day he got mouthy with a cop, who searched him and found his non-medical &quot;dangerous illegal drug&quot;. My passenger said the search was probably illegal, but his overworked public defender didn&#x27;t get the charges dismissed. I remember him saying it cost him about $5000.<p>The modern police officer&#x27;s job involves, in part, hurting people who don&#x27;t actually need to be hurt. Qualified immunity allows them to do the full spectrum of their job responsibilities without being hurt themselves.

Get it out of your system now, because the above mentioned stuff took me 10 months, personally. Create a computer graphics engine with OpenGL and Java. Yes, you could do C++ but that&#x27;s complicating things for now. If you really want to though, go ahead, C++ is a fine choice if you&#x27;re burning with passion.<p>These 3 steps probably take between 4 to 8 months.

Organize a free, special elections, which would allow newly formed parties and other candidates to run.<p>3. Free all the political prisoners, and honor the general declaration of human rights in practice.<p>- As a result of this, a provisional cabinet (kind of compromise between the current elites and opposition) was established, which realized these goals in the timeframe of half a year.<p>I think in your case, you should organize a general nationwide strike, and demand the following:<p>1. A constitutional reform to end dual-party system in the US, i.e. allow more candidates and parties to run, forbid all the shenanigans around voting (like electoral college and gerrymandering and queues at polling stations and obscure voting methods and machines), reform the campaign financing.<p>2.

The performance of individual renders is one area of improvement but I think the main contribution is the clarity the update model provides.<p>React works well until you try to avoid re-rendering and then it really falls appart. For example, updating a context re-renders the whole component chain from producer to consumer, and trying to block useless re-renders with shouldComponentUpdate easily leads to mistakes where children don&#x27;t update when they should. Since React rendering use lazy evaluation of JSX expressions, tracking who exactly updates and when is much harder than what it might seem initially (akin to tracking mutations in a language with lazy evaluation). As this library actually tracks dependencies and only re-renders what you want, all of this bloat is avoided. One aspect that impresses me in particular is that JSX expressions actually return real DOM nodes, making it easy to keep references to them for imperative operations (not a big deal but so much nicer than React refs).<p>I&#x27;m wondering why you opted for the setState API rather than a nicer imperative API like Mobx.

We had a great group of engineers and product people, many of us far too talented to be in company like what hertz turned into. We were under the leadership of an incredible division head and most of the folks in our group felt a deep sense of loyalty to her. Nearly all of us, including that division head, are gone now, mostly laid off. If you poll any random Hertz alumnus, the story you&#x27;re likely to hear is &quot;we had a great team and incompetent senior management.&quot;<p>To us, there is a quote in a different bloomberg article from last week [1] which strikes us as accurate. Attributed to Maryanne Keller, who is referred to in this article, it says:<p>&gt; &#x27;It’s a saga about gross mismanagement,” said Maryann Keller, a longtime auto-<p>&gt; industry consultant who was on the board of Dollar Thrifty when Hertz acquired<p>&gt; the company. “It could have been salvaged had he picked the right management,”<p>&gt; she said, referring to Icahn.&#x27;<p>Icahn lost $1.6b. Thousands of us lost our jobs. But these C-suiters sailed the company to bankruptcy over five years, each of them extracting 7 or 8 figure bonuses. The CIO who laid us all off, for example, received $6.5 million compensation that year [2]. (Sidenote, the work we were doing was replaced with Accenture consultants, who couldn&#x27;t handle it, screwing up so bad they ended up in court [3].)<p>One former colleague of mine wrote a post on LinkedIn suggesting Icahn was the unwitting victim of untenable debt situation, and while he may be correct that the debt made it difficult, Icahn can read a balance sheet and he understood the situation.<p>I can&#x27;t speak about Marinello&#x27;s performance, but I agree that the problem dates back to 2014 or even earlier. People have a widespread belief that Frissora was flying too close to the sun, driven by his aggressive personality. Despite his flaws, he had a great team of people who kept the business running, and it wasn&#x27;t Frissora who fired them all. Nobody, it turns out, was a fan of him. But everyone agrees he was far better than the gang of unusually wealthy miscreants that Icahn replaced him with.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2020-05-27&#x2F;icahn-files-13d-a-on-hertz\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2020-05-27&#x2F;icahn-fil...<\/a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cio.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;3404205&#x2F;how-much-do-cios-really-make-pay-packages-of-25-fortune-500-execs-revealed.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cio.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;3404205&#x2F;how-much-do-cios-really-...<\/a><p>[3] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=19737070\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=19737070<\/a>"],"time":["2020-06-01 16:18:42"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["autokad"],"id":[23382083],"kids":[23382290],"parent":[23375733],"text":["hertz had a &#x27;hackathon&#x27; (more like datathon?) at my university in 2013.

The outbreak was traced to a herd of sheep in Libya&#x27;s Tripoli region, which began suffering screwworm attacks in July 1989; over the following months, the myiasis spread rapidly, infecting numerous herds across a 25,000 km2 area. Eventually, the infested region spanned from the Mediterranean coast to the Sahara Desert, threatening the more than 2.7 million animals susceptible to C. hominvorax that inhabited the area. More than 14,000 cases of large-scale myiasis due to the C. hominivorax species were documented. Traditional control methods using veterinary assessment and treatment of individual animals were insufficient to contain the widely dispersed outbreak, so the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization launched a program based on the sterile insect technique.[10] About 1.26 billion sterile flies were produced in Mexico, shipped to the infested area, and released to mate with their wild counterparts. Within months, the C. hominvorax population collapsed; by April 1991, the program had succeeded in eradicating C. hominivorax in the Eastern Hemisphere. This effort, which cost under US$100 million, was among the most efficient and successful international animal health programs in UN history.&quot;<p>Incredible!<p>1. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Cochliomyia\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Cochliomyia<\/a>"],"time":["2020-06-01 14:14:25"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["geofft"],"id":[23375586],"kids":[23376738,23377811,23377564,23376390],"parent":[23368585],"text":["A little tangential, but having just been in an argument here with someone who advocated a &quot;nightwatchman state,&quot; I wonder what they&#x27;d think of the USDA&#x27;s efforts here (as well as the other governments&#x27;).
