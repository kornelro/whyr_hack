If I import an article into SuperMemo, SuperMemo has good tools for breaking it down (incrementally) and processing it manageably. While there’s a bit of a learning curve to being efficient, given an hour with a textbook chapter I could convert and retain the core content better than a note taker or an anki card maker. One of the things I like the most about it is that it makes processing manageable. It doesn’t make it easy but I never have to worry about needing to do too much at once. It’s all incremental and stress less (after you get over the figure out how to use it phrase).<p>The second thing it does well is allow you to learn effectively (the right things with your time). It has a priority system and a queueing algorithm that allows you to focus on highest yield material. It also has a system for allowing you to learn things in an order. That might seem trivial but if I’m reading a Wikipedia page and want to go back when I’ve learned something else, that’s a huge pain to manage traditionally. SuperMemo makes that fairly easy so you’re always able to make sure to learn background info as scaffolding before harder things.<p>I highly recommend people try it even though starting with it is pretty hard. If you’re interested you can either email me (email is in my profile) or join the SuperMemo discord servers also linked there.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.supermemo.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;archives1990-2015&#x2F;help&#x2F;read\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.supermemo.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;archives1990-2015&#x2F;help&#x2F;read<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-27 10:37:40"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Marcus316"],"id":[23323110],"kids":[23323173],"parent":[23308931],"text":["The mechanical <i>how<\/i> people read at higher speeds might be an interesting topic.<p>What I often do when I am &quot;reading&quot; for knowledge can probably be simplified down to &quot;I read fairly quickly&quot;, but there&#x27;s no nuance in that statement to talk about what I&#x27;m doing when I&#x27;m reading and how I move so quickly.<p>I am often doing some combination of:<p>- scanning (moving quickly across sight-words, finding relevant points of entry into the subject matter)<p>- absorbing (slower process of gathering words surrounding the entry point to gain better local context)<p>- backtracking (taking local context and fixing it into a broader context)<p>- full-on processing (often this looks like deep reading, but it is more like deep thinking; I take in fewer words from the page, but connect them to concepts I already understand)<p>This is not a linear process, at least for myself.<p>This is different from when I read for pleasure.

There is a limit on how much value a developer can bring by working on assigned stories and tickets, and experience after a few years plateau (and age discrimination start to kick in), but go higher in the chain and suddenly you experience becomes very valuable.

Prepare for long build times for simple changes, which becomes a bit silly once you hook up a CMS that triggers builds for each change. As a content editor having to wait 5 minutes for your change to be deployed kinda sucks. GraphQL for loading data often felt overkill and a lot of hassle. If you want to add something like a simple contact form you are encouraged to use external services which just get’s out of hand for what I want to be a simple self-contained site.

It took me over a minute to build a personal blog.\n- Weird forced implementation of GraphQL. To display something as simple as an image I was forced to use GraphQL. Also your GraphQL can&#x27;t be dynamically generated, meaning it&#x27;s hard to make anything modular. And the GraphQL paths has a ton of extraneous nested fields (eg. `data.file.childImageSharp.fixed`)\n- Version upgrades were a pain in the ass and would often break my site.\n- My site actually seemed slow. For example, links don&#x27;t work until the entire JS loads and executes, so if your internet isn&#x27;t fast then your website basically isn&#x27;t functional for the first 2-5 seconds despite the page being visible.\n- Very few themes (maybe be better now, but at the time the selection was awful, especially compared to Jekyll). No real concept of themes in the first place, switching from one theme to another requires an entire code rewrite.\n- Limited functionality built-in. For example, want tagging? You&#x27;ll need to code that in.<p>Gatsby sits in an odd spot of not being simple enough to save you a lot of time or empower a non-technical person to manage (eg. like WordPress), but not flexible enough to do anything you want since it&#x27;s an opinionated SSG framework. It&#x27;s like you&#x27;re getting all the complexity of a React&#x2F;GraphQL application, without any of the flexibility of being able to pick your own stack.<p>Sure it has a nice plugin system, but beyond that since you need a developer to set up and maintain a Gatsby site anyways, I don&#x27;t see any reason not to just use Next.js (which can export to static) since all Gatsby really does beyond that is converting markdown to HTML, which is just done through an npm library anyways. If writing a Next.js website is overkill, then why do you need to be devoting engineering resources to this in the first place? Why not just use some no-code solution like WordPress? Or if you really want a separate headless CMS, then Jekyll felt easier and faster to me with more theme options (though again it&#x27;s been a year since I touched these, so I imagine things have improved).<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong I love SSGs as nothing beats the performance, ease of deployment, and low cost of static sites. But if I&#x27;m going to use a SSG framework, it better be dead simple and&#x2F;or easy to customize, otherwise I might as well just use some off-the-shelf &quot;no-code&quot; solution (eg. WordPress, Wix, Squarespace), or use a framework like Next.js that let&#x27;s me customize my stack instead of being locked into Gatsby&#x27;s.

After 20 hours (on 60-70 workstations) he had the counts, so knew the exact million-integer range in which the prime occurred, from which the 10 billionth prime turns out to be either 252,097,800,629 (with 2 as the 0th prime) or 252,097,800,623 (with 2 as the 1st prime).<p>After doing this, he was able to correct an off-by-one count in a table in a printed book, but the real moral of the story is that this is of course a poor way to compute the nth prime for large n: it has been known since the 1800s how to quickly compute pi(x) (the number of primes not greater than x), and using a published algorithm known at the time would have let him find the ten billionth prime in less than 3 minutes instead of thousands of hours of computer time.<p>That&#x27;s the article (though I&#x27;ve focused more on the algorithm while it says “this column is not so much an article about programming as it is about computer logistics”), but these days we can just hit up <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wolframalpha.com&#x2F;input&#x2F;?i=the+ten+billionth+prime\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wolframalpha.com&#x2F;input&#x2F;?i=the+ten+billionth+prim...<\/a> or <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;primes.utm.edu&#x2F;nthprime&#x2F;index.php#nth\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;primes.utm.edu&#x2F;nthprime&#x2F;index.php#nth<\/a> or enter &quot;prime(10000000000)&quot; into <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;live.sympy.org&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;live.sympy.org&#x2F;<\/a> (this times out for some reason, though primepi(22801763489) takes less than a minute so you could binary-search manually), or enter &quot;nth_prime(10^10)&quot; into Sage (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sagemath.org&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sagemath.org&#x2F;<\/a>) to get the result pretty much instantly (after it starts up, which takes a while), or...."],"time":["2020-05-27 02:55:42"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["gregfjohnson"],"id":[23318534],"kids":[23318977,23321274,23319011,23320797],"parent":[23310684],"text":["The stated moral of the story (last line of the article):  &quot;Brains win again over brawn: a well-designed, mathematically knowledgeable algorithm beats brute force!&quot;<p>This reminds me of a claim I heard from a numerical analysis colleague:  &quot;Algorithms of today running on hardware from the 1950&#x27;s would beat algorithms of the 1950&#x27;s running on hardware of today.&quot;<p>It was a thought-provoking comment.

I think there&#x27;s a real distinction to be made between web pages and web applications. HN seems to have a bias against web applications which is probably unfair.<p>Most web developers today do not set out to build web pages. They start with full-on experiences they would like to bring to users, and the web stack is their tool of choice in doing so. There is nothing wrong with this! And different considerations apply in the development of such applications versus a web page.<p>Philosophically, SourceHut is about non-browser-based workflows (e.g. using email for merge requests). Since SourceHut users do far less of their SourceHut-related work on the actual website, SourceHut can afford to take a web page approach. GitHub, in contrast, focuses on browser-based workflows. They actually do a pretty great job at it - and this is something that they can do only because they take a web application approach. I like their keyboard shortcuts, for example, but these would be difficult (impossible?) to implement on a simple HTML page.<p>No single user can say that one approach is right and the other is wrong. All they can do is assert preferences.

One form of browser imitation that particularly annoys me is client-side page loading. This is where JavaScript code intercepts activation of links, loads the new page using XHR or the like, then updates the current DOM in-place. Yes, this gives web developers the opportunity to prefetch pages or do fancy animations. But the accessibility problem here is that there&#x27;s no way for an implementation of this technique to signal to a screen reader that a page loaded just as if the browser itself had loaded the page.

When I started looking digging into the platform as a developer the feeling was exactly the same: care and refinements were almost omnipresent in every aspect of the platform.<p>While bugs - and even nasty ones - have never been aliens on Mac OS X&#x2F;macOS, what I&#x27;ve personally started to experience in the past few years is a feeling of neglect toward the platform.<p>Yes, Catalyst seems to go against this trend: its intent, though, is to ease the porting effort of iOS applications to Mac. A certainly laudable goal.<p>What would probably be more laudable for Mac users and developers are: core platform stability and quality, API stability, developer documentation overhaul [1].<p>Our CI breaks every single time there&#x27;s a minor macOS update and&#x2F;or an Xcode update: we&#x27;re at the point where our macOS UITests (XCTest) require more maintenance to keep working than the application itself.\nXCTest on macOS has ridiculous bugs. I lost count of the radars we&#x27;ve opened, and the sample apps for reduction we&#x27;ve sent to Apple.<p>At every single minor macOS upgrade, few users complain that our application &quot;doesn&#x27;t work anymore&quot; in certain cases. And to be exquisitely blunt: there ain&#x27;t wrong with the application itself.\nRebooting after a macOS upgrade fixes whatever event tap regression we hit in Quartz.<p>In general, what I&#x27;d personally like to see:<p>* a less &quot;hysterical&quot; approach to the OS would be so. much. appreciated.

This in turn has made me reluctant to revisit the books (Selfish Gene and Blind Watchmaker) that influenced me so much, for fear that I&#x27;ll see more of the same shallow thought that equates evolution with selective breeding.<p>In this link the problem I see is that he is too focused on the mechanic of change. The trick of evolution is not random mutations, etc., but has to do with statistical properties of large population groups. A population that is of sufficient size will have variation within the constraints of the fitness function. How those variations are achieved is not really even that important except as regards the rate of evolution, rather than the effect of it.<p>But the fitness function is extremely complex; it&#x27;s not just changing a few parameters. A population of land-dwellers is largely indifferent to the ability to float; so some creatures can float better, others float worse, but it doesn&#x27;t matter. But at some point the floaters get good enough at floating that they can actually swim, and now there&#x27;s a whole new fitness landscape to explore. And the fitness function can change over time.<p>The most important thing is variation -- that&#x27;s the &quot;anti-fragile&quot; hook that makes life so tenacious.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;RichardDawkins&#x2F;status&#x2F;1228943686953664512\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;RichardDawkins&#x2F;status&#x2F;122894368695366451...<\/a> -- &quot;It’s one thing to deplore eugenics on ideological, political, moral grounds.

Proof: (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rtc.edu&#x2F;net-arch\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rtc.edu&#x2F;net-arch<\/a>)<p>First off, this is a great starting point! There is a goal for every year, the courses clearly build upon each other, and there is an end-goal. I am a big advocate for project-based learning, and I&#x27;m seeing more employers seriously consider portfolios like GitHub and blogs. No employer cares that you got a 103% on your algorithms exam, and few vaguely care about your GPA. They do care if you can hold a conversation about a topic. They do care if you applied the knowledge, like building something that uses a tree, even if you didn&#x27;t explicitly write all the data structure code yourself.<p>This curriculum is designed for the elite, think a student that would do well at Stanford. This is probably an obvious comment, as the majority of courses come from Stanford, but it&#x27;s important to note that the breakneck speed of this curriculum targets the top 1-5% percentile of students. If our hypothetical freshman is a high school graduate they need to have done well on the BC Calculus, AP Statistics, and AP Computer Science exams at minimum. It also assumes that the student has enough computer experience to pick up advanced skills rapidly. You could argue that &quot;Introduction to Computer Systems&quot; and &quot;Programming Fundamentals&quot; are entry level, but reading carefully they are closer to the 2nd or 3rd CS course a student would take in a normal sequence. Week 2 in the programming fundamentals talks about Stacks and Queues, and Week 1 in Intro to Computer Systems introduces Unix, the CLI, and GitHub all in one week. These are very advanced topics for students that come in with 0 knowledge. You will need either rigorous admissions requirements, or prepare for a high first-year drop out rate.<p>We tried a 4th year very similar to what was described in the article. Students could pick a final project done in partnership with industry, or report on their internship&#x2F;career if they were already in one. Students responded with &quot;What do I need to do to get full credit?&quot;, &quot;Can you give me step-by-step instructions that I can follow?&quot;, and &quot;What will be on the exam?&quot; (there are no exams in the program after year 2).\nAfter 3 years of being explicitly told what they must do to succeed, students have correctly learned that going above and beyond in a class rarely yields extrinsic benefit within the scope of a class. To put it another way, students are trained to work efficiently in a classroom environment, &quot;Exactly as hard as I need to get the exact grade I want, and not 1% more.&quot;\nIt&#x27;s not necessarily a bad mindset, but we need to train students out of habits that are bad if applied outside of the classroom. In the case of my program, we chose to set a bar in the 4th year but didn&#x27;t tell students how high to jump. This translates to removing a lot of clarity in assignment rubrics, and providing direction but not answers. A lot of students flailed, but none failed (yet!). Graduates report a smoother transition into industry.\nWe also introduced GitHub in their third year as a portfolio tool, few students have enough knowledge to understand and use it before then. At the end of every quarter students build a final project in groups, and apply all of the skills that go into a good repository (collaborators, pull requests, readmes, CI, etc.). While not all employers are looking at the actual projects, all students who have graduated thus far have said they used the knowledge of talking about a project in interviews.\nOn the internship&#x2F;project classes&#x2F;research front, unless you are using your reputation to open those doors for students (as I had to), a student&#x27;s best chance of arbitrary contribution is through GitHub Issues and PRs. Your college&#x27;s reputation is also a major factor here; In the case of my specific college, Amazon Web Services won&#x27;t work with us because of a teaching agreement that went sour before I was hired.<p>Some critiques from others I&#x27;d like to comment on, in lieu of the author:\n&quot;Why isn&#x27;t there core class X?&quot; - Most students can&#x27;t handle more than 2 core classes per quarter. That means 24 core classes over a 4 year period. Choose wisely. I think the author chose well, but no plan survives it&#x27;s first encounter. My curriculum certainly didn&#x27;t, and 3 years in we&#x27;ve thrown out almost all of the curriculum we initially wrote.<p>&quot;No ethics, soft skills?&quot; - This is a core class curriculum. Electives and additional classes for &quot;rounding out&quot; a student occur during at a later phase of curriculum design, usually when it&#x27;s time to meet accreditation standards. \nFrom there you will not like the second part of this answer. In my 3 year study on building an IT bachelor&#x27;s (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nsf.gov&#x2F;awardsearch&#x2F;showAward?AWD_ID=1601140\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nsf.gov&#x2F;awardsearch&#x2F;showAward?AWD_ID=1601140<\/a>), we found ethics training to work AGAINST a student&#x27;s hiring prospects (cue pitchforks). Our Business and Industry Leadership Team (representatives from technology companies) rated &quot;teaching ethics&quot; at an average of 2.1&#x2F;5 (A 2 means slight disagree that this should be taught). They marked &quot;ethical knowledge application&quot; at 1.4&#x2F;5 (A 1 means strongly disagree that this is important). The BILT team commented that they were unlikely to listen to a recent graduate&#x27;s ethical concerns on a project, they would regard a graduate raising the concerns as a &#x27;nuisance&#x27;, and that they would fire the graduate if their ethical concerns significantly impacted their job performance (cue more pitchforks).\nFinally, consider the fresh graduate&#x27;s perspective. The typical first-job-out-of-college mindset is &quot;I have a ton of debt. I&#x27;ll take the first job with the largest salary.&quot; I see this advice regularly on HN."],"time":["2020-05-27 16:58:10"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["kyawzazaw"],"id":[23321634],"kids":{},"parent":[23321426],"text":["I think CMU&#x27;s 15-213 is better than Stanford&#x27;s CS107."],"time":["2020-05-27 13:07:58"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["arcadeparade"],"id":[23321567],"kids":[23325864,23322223],"parent":[23321426],"text":["I’d like to see a similar one for computer science"],"time":["2020-05-27 12:57:52"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["cat199"],"id":[23322863],"kids":{},"parent":[23321426],"text":["Machine learning is not AI, but a part of it."],"time":["2020-05-27 15:31:09"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["stu2b50"],"id":[23326332],"kids":[23327289,23327575,23326700,23328594,23326441,23326810,23329668,23326478,23332246,23329822,23326574,23327701,23326618,23328841,23327412,23328735,23327397,23327710],"parent":[23325885],"text":["I&#x27;m not saying what the article is describing isn&#x27;t necessarily happening, but cmon do a little more research than that.<p>Their entire evidence is bringing up that Lyft and The Container Store Group reduced salaries for the period.

This makes ramping new employees and doling out restricted access so much easier. If you give someone VPN access, you need to hire a full time guy to manage that bucket of pain if you want granular per-user permissions at the network-level. Web has no such problems. Everything is typically a completely independent security context in terms of network for any layer below HTTP. VPN means you have ~layer 3+ access by default to everything on that network.<p>There is an argument to be made for &quot;XYZ doesn&#x27;t have a web interface&#x2F;API&quot;. But, I pose that this is a weak argument in 2020. Every cloud provider can be automated 100% via API calls. Every single thing you can do on the GitHub[Lab] web UI can be automated. Even if there isn&#x27;t an explicit API, you can automate literally any legacy application with some mild scripting and duct tape. I&#x27;ve seen automation that samples a 3d application output in real-time and checks pixel colors for eventing, so I know this can be done. Bonus points here because these are typically legacy static and never-changing systems so you can code for it 1 time. There aren&#x27;t really any excuses in my shop for manual labor. Setting up a new public webapp that can 2FA your employees and provision cloud resources via the AWS JSON API is not hard. You can make it hard, but you can also make it very very easy if you just focus on the value angle. Once you build one of these things, the next one takes 1&#x2F;10th time time because you know how to do it. Maybe you just add a 2nd navigation option to your 1st one to manage that additional system..."],"time":["2020-05-28 00:35:12"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["joshma"],"id":[23328239],"kids":[23328605],"parent":[23326755],"text":["We currently use a mildly exotic &quot;temporary bastion&quot; approach, where upon request &#x2F; approval a dev can get a container launched.

Excited to share with the HN community what we’ve been working on over the last 18 months.<p>Twingate is a modern solution for remote access that replaces your VPN. It’s designed to address the underlying security issues with a traditional VPN + network perimeter, but it’s super simple to deploy, manage, and use. It introduces “zero trust” concepts like least-privileged access controls at the application level, hiding public attack surfaces, and continuous network authorization, but without the complicated change management typically required to get there.<p>We’ve particularly focused on making it work seamlessly for developer workflows &amp; tools, so excited to hear what you all think.  You can try it out for free today.<p>You can read more about how the underlying technology for Twingate works here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.twingate.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;how-twingate-works\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.twingate.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;how-twingate-works<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-27 19:31:05"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["hashamali"],"id":[23327019],"kids":[23327223],"parent":[23326755],"text":["Very cool!

Inoculation is not guaranteed to be effective against covid. Just because there was a version of it called variolation that worked against smallpox before being eliminated because it was not as good as other approaches does not mean inoculation is automatically safe and effective against a completely unrelated virus. Other coronavirus are known to display antibody dependent enhancement, where a weak immune response makes following infections worse, and we already don&#x27;t see consistent, strong responses from people who were sick.<p>What the economist Hanson is essentially suggesting is that we take a worse method of immunization (just the normal live virus) and waive the regulatory burden to show safety and efficacy because a similar approach worked with smallpox. If we are getting into the business of ignoring the requirement for an immunization approach to be clinically validated, then there are a few dozen vaccines with far better theoretical safety and efficacy profiles that we should be using instead. The reason a vaccine isn&#x27;t coming immediately is because we have to show they wont kill people and that they&#x27;ll work, and then we have to scale up production.
