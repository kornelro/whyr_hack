At least the headlines. Sometimes it&#x27;s unrelated to work, but mostly it&#x27;s about tech somehow educating and inspiring. Personally I would say, it helped me to keep track of what is going on, what is trending and the best thing: Sometimes I find a nice piece of software that I haven&#x27;t known about.<p>Back to things that I consider waste of time:<p>1. Bikeshedding\nHave you ever had a discussion about timezones with a solution designer? It&#x27;s everytime the same: &quot;We need localtime because system x is doing it and it&#x27;s confusing to compare it&quot; (no, you don&#x27;t! You need to store them with timezone information and solve the human problem in presentation)<p>2. Discussing the need for bigger changes\nYep. Your agile-developed system is running for some time and you see how it&#x27;s being used and notice: It works, but it could be much better.<p>So you start a meeting others here describe as waste of time, because the result is &quot;no&quot; and the lasting result is, that somebody might keep the idea for later because there is potential (so not completely wasted).<p>But anyway, the time to prepare what you want to express in a way even managers can understand is annoying.<p>Coworkers often tell me, my ideas are inspiring and they would want to see them implemented. I feel it shatters because they are too big and sometimes cause efforts for other times because they have to change something so coordination is needed etc.<p>3. Finding workarounds for technical restrictions given by the company or project\nDevelopment workspace is virtual and has a proxy with whitelisting for internet access. Things like Python&#x27;s pip are useless. So you setup a proxy on your local machine and build up a reverse tunnel.<p>More common: Doing things on machines without root access. You have to figure out how you get information why something is not working but logs are not accessible. Nope. You have to ask someone with at maximum your understanding of the problem to assist you.<p>Closing:\nI consider myself as maybe 50% productive, but compared to results of others, I&#x27;m feeling much more effective, when I&#x27;m doing something. Not mentioning when I&#x27;m motivated and very concentrated.

Liberal theories of nice capitalism require multiple competing companies on &quot;fair&quot; grounds. But it is obviously annoying and inefficient to have market competition in software most of the time - once a tool is developed, it&#x27;s nearly free for 100% of people to use it rather than 50%, and it&#x27;s crucial that all such tools interoperate nicely. Hence why various walled-off social media platforms are annoying and people are squeezed into at most only a couple for a given purpose. When right wingers point out that anti-trust stuff is inefficient, to an extent they&#x27;re right.<p>The rational thing is to have a &quot;monopoly&quot; that isn&#x27;t evil. But that means that democratic control shouldn&#x27;t be after-the-fact, external regulation (shown time and time again to be insufficient and generally bought off) but fundamental to the operating of these companies. In essence, Google makes the case for democratic management of production - socialism - very clear.<p>But the other important part of this theory is it&#x27;s not just about &quot;what would be nice to have&quot; in some utopian sense. Larger companies have competitive advantages that cause them to grow even faster - some real economies of scale, more political heft, greater bargaining power. This leads to the system being inherently unstable and tending towards concentration, which is apparent in pretty much every sector of tech. Trying to permanently reverse this trend through anti-trust is as nonsensical as suggesting people go back to living in the woods; it is in opposition to the fundamental trends inherent in market economies.

It also has made statements that Taiwan is part of China since then, which has left the U.S. without an advanced-node fab. Intel is at least a node behind both Samsung and TSMC, and the U.S. has no trusted foundry on U.S. soil capable of 7nm volume production, let alone 5nm or 3nm.<p>For the U.S., this is a potential disaster. If China marches into Taiwan, the U.S. will be left with no advanced-node manufacturing and it will have lost the technology race. It would take at least four to six years to recover, and by that time China would own the market. This is very scary for the U.S., which needs to develop AI chips at the most advanced nodes because density equals more accelerators and other types of processing elements. Even that isn&#x27;t enough, which is why companies developing AI chips are stitching together chips that are larger than a single reticle.

Yes there has been growing concern about the integrity of the supply chain for critical resources, but that is the whole globalization problem in a nutshell. I find the calls to re-vertically-integrate the US to not be very persuasive in terms of practicality. Maybe if Canada and Mexico join the US in an economic union similar to the EU? Chips are just one part of a much larger puzzle and fabs are just one part of a supply chain that includes stops in Malaysia, Indonesia, and Vietnam for packaging and testing.<p>I do think it has been made abundantly clear how interdependent the world is these days. It is possible that the new clarity has caused some powerful forces to reconsider their world view. But has it changed it enough to create real and meaningful policy change? (For context, I see globalization as a means of maximizing profits, not about politics)<p>To my way of thinking, real change would be the ability to economically stand up a 100mm 5nm fab line profitably. That would allow the production of &quot;jelly bean&quot; chips (general purpose &lt; 100M gates).

After forty years, it has begun to corrode, both itself and us. It is still a marvelous and miraculous invention, but now there are bugs in the foundation, bats in the belfry, and trolls in the basement.<p>I do not mean this to be one of those technophobic rants dissing the Internet for rewiring our brains to give us the twitchy attention span of Donald Trump on Twitter or pontificating about how we have to log off and smell the flowers. Those qualms about new technologies have existed ever since Plato fretted that the technology of writing would threaten memorization and oratory. I love the internet and all of its digital offshoots. What I bemoan is its decline.<p>There is a bug in its original design that at first seemed like a feature but has gradually, and now rapidly, been exploited by hackers and trolls and malevolent actors: its packets are encoded with the address of their destination but not of their authentic origin. With a circuit-switched network, you can track or trace back the origins of the information, but that’s not true with the packet-switched design of the internet.<p>Compounding this was the architecture that Tim Berners-Lee and the inventors of the early browsers created for the World Wide Web. It brilliantly allowed the whole of the earth’s computers to be webbed together and navigated through hyperlinks. But the links were one-way. You knew where the links took you. But if you had a webpage or piece of content, you didn’t exactly know who was linking to you or coming to use your content.<p>All of that enshrined the potential for anonymity. You could make comments anonymously. Go to a webpage anonymously. Consume content anonymously. With a little effort, send email anonymously. And if you figured out a way to get into someone’s servers or databases, you could do it anonymously.<p>For years, the benefits of anonymity on the Net outweighed its drawbacks. People felt more free to express themselves, which was especially valuable if they were dissidents or hiding a personal secret. This was celebrated in the famous 1993 New Yorker cartoon, “On the Internet, nobody knows you’re a dog.”<p>Now the problem is nobody can tell if you’re a troll. Or a hacker. Or a bot. Or a Macedonian teenager publishing a story that the Pope has endorsed Trump.<p>This has poisoned civil discourse, enabled hacking, permitted cyberbullying, and made email a risk. Its inherent lack of security has allowed Russian actors to screw with our democratic process.<p>The lack of secure identification and authentication inherent in the internet’s genetic code has also prevented easy transactions, thwarted financial inclusion, destroyed the business models of content creators, unleashed deluges of spam, and forced us to use passwords and two-factor authentication schemes that would have baffled Houdini.<p>The trillions being spent and the IQ points of computer science talent being allocated to tackle security issues makes it a drag, rather than a spur, to productivity in some sectors.<p>In Plato’s Republic, we learn the tale of the Ring of Gyges. Put it on, and you’re invisible and anonymous. The question that Plato asks is whether those who put on the ring will be civil and moral. He thinks not. The Internet has proven him correct.<p>The Web is no longer a place of community, no longer an agora. Every day more sites are eliminating comments sections.<p>If we could start from scratch, here’s what I think we would do:<p>Create a system that enables content producers to negotiate with aggregators and search engines to get a royalty whenever their content is used, like ASCAP has negotiated for public performances and radio airings of its members’ works.<p>Embed a simple digital wallet and currency for quick and easy small payments for songs, blogs, articles, and whatever other digital content is for sale.<p>Encode emails with an authenticated return or originating address.<p>Enforce critical properties and security at the lowest levels of the system possible, such as in the hardware or in the programming language, instead of leaving it to programmers to incorporate security into every line of code they write.<p>Build chips and machines that update the notion of an internet packet. For those who want, their packets could be encoded or tagged with metadata that describe what they contain and give the rules for how it can be used.<p>Most internet engineers think that these reforms are possible, from Vint Cerf, the original TCP&#x2F;IP coauthor, to Milo Medin of Google, to Howard Shrobe, the director of cybersecurity at MIT. “We don’t need to live in cyber hell,” Shrobe has argued.<p>Implementing them is less a matter of technology than of cost and social will. Some people, understandably, will resist any diminution of anonymity, which they sometimes label privacy.<p>So the best approach, I think, would be to try to create a voluntary system, for those who want to use it, to have verified identification and authentication.<p>People would not be forced to use such a system. If they wanted to communicate and surf anonymously, they could. But those of us who choose, at times, not to be anonymous and not to deal with people who are anonymous should have that right as well. That’s the way it works in the real world.<p>The benefits would be many: Easy and secure ways to deal with your finances and medical records. Small payment systems that could reward valued content rather than the current incentive to concentrate on clickbait for advertising. Less hacking, spamming, cyberbullying, trolling, and the spewing of anonymous hate. And the possibility of a more civil discourse."],"time":["2020-05-15 23:59:40"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["noads"],"id":[23194761],"kids":{},"parent":[23194178],"text":["This seems somewhat myopic.

It reported an arrest of a suspect(with real name), the suspected crime was copyright infringement for he quoted the local city&#x27;s official web sites. This is strange as the Japanese copyright clearly stated that the publication from the government body cannot be copyrighted. It seems to me, that the suspect has some kind of mental issues or strong personal dislike toward the local city he is living. His web site blame every move by the local city, like he don&#x27;t like the recent announcement from the city as it can be interpreted to mean malicious intent or blame the news of the minor crime by the local city&#x27;s civil servants. So I suspect that local city claimed the bogus copyright violation and let local police arrest him to silence him.<p>What unusual about this removal is, that the reason they stated was defamation, not the usual copyright violation claim that US infamously force Web service provider to censor the information without the court order. As this is not the usual DMCA takedown notice, they don&#x27;t give a person who claimed the defamation, so I cannot easily sue back the person who claimed that.<p>The definition of the defamation varies between jurisdictions, In some jurisdictions, the mere fact does not constitute as the defamation, In my jurisdiction, Japan, simply stating the fact can be a defamation. But not all statements be a defamation off course. The right to be forgotten does not exist in Japan. So simply quoting the news source with real name of suspect widely reported is not a defamation.<p>As I consulted with my lawyer, they advised me it doesn&#x27;t worth it to take action. This is the first case they&#x27;ve heard. As I stated in the beginning, Google don&#x27;t negotiate. It&#x27;s so hard to negotiate with the real living human from the Google as all the response from the Google is BOT. But at least, the Google comply with the law and the court order. If it&#x27;s DMCA takedown notice, it should be trivial to reveal the claimer, as the law requires to reveal the claimer.<p>There was interesting techniques to let google censor the information wide spreading in the wild. That you sue without explicitly specify the defendant in a minor country, win because there is no defendant to argue, using that court order to\nlet Google censor the information as Google at least comply with the court order.<p>In my jurisdiction, Japan, there is a procedure to sue without specifying the defendant, but it&#x27;s rarely used. The court usually won&#x27;t allow such procedure. And in my case, I revealed my real name and address in my blog so it&#x27;s unlikely Japanese court allow such lawsuit to happen. I don&#x27;t know about the foreign countries but I cannot practically know the lawsuit of all the countries in the world.<p>With the unusual defamation claim, and google don&#x27;t reveal the information, because of the rule &quot;Google don&#x27;t negotiate&quot;. If I were to sue the claimer, First I have to sue the Google to reveal the information of claimers. It costs so much money and time. This is my personal blog with no ad revenue. It doesn&#x27;t worth it.<p>Still, it&#x27;s interesting who is the claimer. The local city and police won&#x27;t do this. No matter how corrupt they are, they can&#x27;t do this. That leave the suspect, but the article was written in favour to the suspect and if he has the sane literacy and mental state, he won&#x27;t interpret it as the defamation toward him. But his web site was full of strange interpretation and hateful interpretation on the local city&#x27;s publication, I&#x27;m not so sure about this. Still, it&#x27;s strange he successfully let the Google remove the article of him with unusual defamation claim.<p>There is another possibility that the third person, a complete stranger claimed it just to screw me. But it&#x27;s a tiny achievement considering the fact that I have hundreds of article in Blogger, mirroring it to GitHub Pages, and I can simply repost the same article to anywhere if I want to(with the consequence on me if this really, legally constitute the defamation).<p>The moral is, Google don&#x27;t negotiate."],"time":["2020-05-16 08:39:51"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["drivebycomment"],"id":[23200488],"kids":{},"parent":[23195680],"text":["FWIW, the last Google&#x27;s transparency report said 4.6B URLs removed.

The good intentions that poured energy into all the 20% products are no longer the point. Somewhere along the way, someone figured out how to use them strategically. The free products are good, good enough to use, until you realize that there is no path for continued growth or investment of resources, and run into seemingly arbitrary disappointments and limitations; it as if at some point, someone stopped the projects from adding cool utility to the product, and started making sure that hindered, crippled versions of the feature were offered instead. I experience this most acutely with the languishing &quot;Google My Maps&quot; product. It feels as if the target is not just potential competition, but the imagination and demand of the market itself.<p>I don&#x27;t actually know the story of Google Reader and RSS feeds, but I remember how integral RSS feeds were to the golden era of blogging, and how abruptly that era seems to have ended with Google Reader&#x27;s apparent death. And to me, that has a similar feeling. The idea is that the target is <i>not<\/i> potential competition wherever it might spring up; the idea is to sap the demand that might nourish competition, to suck the air out of the room, and stifle the imagination of the market itself.<p>It isn&#x27;t Google alone who is responsible for this feeling, to be fair. There is watching the growth of the walled garden of Facebook, watching the collapse of the old chat services which allowed independent clients, watching successful startup after successful startup turn new ideas into content for a routine process wherein we see the exact same sheen of gloss on the promises, the same dance steps towards the pirouette, the attempt to pivot gracefully and effortlessly towards monetization in a maneuver that is in fact a mating dance desirous of acquisition.<p>All of it really sucks. It&#x27;s not like there&#x27;s an easy alternative. People like free things, and with computer-based resources there is often so much opportunity to scale the value of a thing that free things can be sustainable; a project can succeed and be useful to thousands of people merely on the basis of the labour that some are willing to commit to to sustain it. Again, I&#x27;m less qualified to describe this than most of you are. But that&#x27;s what open source is like.<p>It doesn&#x27;t work with services. Code that runs of different platforms can be replicated&#x2F;adopted for infinitesimal cost, and the underlying costs of running it are naturally distributed. Services are different. The replication&#x2F;adoption and the creation of value both involve on a massive rush of the many to the one. That relationship pretty much sums up the whole story. If capital accrued to capital by a square law, attention would accrue to attention by a cube law. In idiosyncratic niches that cannot be satisfied by the mass service, alternatives are actually viable and flourish. But anything that would be beneficial to us all encounters this problem of needing to absorb the real costs of operation while seeming to be as free as possible, or else the users will flit away to a different flower.<p>There&#x27;s no good solution to this, but the way in which Google has graciously assumed responsibility for directing our attention does not make it better. All the improvements to search results over time seem to focus attention more and more to what an archetype of user is likely to be satisfied with. I would not be surprised if the energy costs per search had gone down. As many have noted, esoteric results are increasingly invisible.<p>Anyways, this is what we have done with the new universe of human communication that has opened up in the last few decades, which we imagined we would leverage into new systems of effortless communication and collaboration. And we have, to a lesser extent. Second best or third best.

So much that most of the code is likely to be interface code (file I&#x2F;O, matching your internal data structures, etc...) rather than parsing. And chances are that a library won&#x27;t even make your code shorter.<p>- As mentioned in the article, CSV is not well defined. I&#x27;ve seen all sorts of weirdness: semicolons vs colons, LF vs CRLF, simple vs double quotes, backslash escaping, comments, floating point numbers with comas instead of points. What your library understands as a CSV may not be the files you have to work with. I&#x27;d rather have a simple piece of code that correspond to what I am given rather than a big library that uses AI techniques to try to guess the intent of whatever wrote this file.<p>There are cases where it would be foolish not to use a library.

It turns out the fancy targeting component PX isn&#x27;t necessary for efficacy in animals. You get even better results using plain old R-OH.<p>Even better, R-OH is the starting material for R-OPX, so you save yourself some reactions to boot.<p>At this point a lesson pops up that gets forgotten time and again in drug discovery programs:<p>ALWAYS RUN THE CONTROL IN ANIMALS - RUN IT EARLY.

You need to get injected multiple times. And that&#x27;s probably going to be in a clinic, and done by people wearing full PPE. An oral drug would allow you to buy pills and convalesce at home, conserving valuable hospital resources.<p>As an aside, you typically use a prodrug because you think it will lead to better drug properties than the parent compound.

Brief caveats: am undergrad pre-med, but also took an infectious diseases grad class at Penn that spent a week diving into one of the papers cited in this article (when the authors mentioned the two compounds &quot;showed no statistically significant difference in potency&quot;). I think it&#x27;s worth exploring what the authors of that paper actually meant to assess for. (also @HN please shoot me down if anything I say is inaccurate, also I do think the authors make other valid points, just not so much in reference to this particular aspect)<p>The paper in question is here (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mbio.asm.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;9&#x2F;2&#x2F;e00221-18\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mbio.asm.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;9&#x2F;2&#x2F;e00221-18<\/a>) and they&#x27;re looking at table 1. First of all, the paper didn&#x27;t set out to actually determine whether GS-441524 is better than GS-5734 (aka remdesivir). It mainly set out to show that remdesivir could work against coronaviruses in general (this was written back in 2018, so they were focusing on SARS and MERS only). Furthermore, all of these experiments were in vitro with a model betaCoV, murine hepatitis virus, so results shouldn&#x27;t necessarily mean much for human populations. But down to the nitty-gritty:<p>In figure 1 of the paper, the authors do in vitro experiments to show that both GS-441524 and remdesivir reduce their model CoV viral titer. However, they show a major difference. Remdesivir has an EC50 (dose at which 50% of viral replication is inhibited) that is much lower than GS-441524. This is great because you don&#x27;t need as much remdesivir to inhibit viral replication. One area where GS-441524 did beat remdesivir was cytotoxicity (CC50 = dose  at which 50% of cells w&#x2F;the drug is killed). You want as high a CC50 as possible. So that would mean that remdesivir is technically more toxic to cells; however, it&#x27;s effective dose is so low that you wouldn&#x27;t need to give a dose large enough to kill off any cells. You can use a handy metric known as the selective index (CC50&#x2F;EC50) to measure the tradeoff. High selective index = high efficacy without killing off your own cells. In this case, remdesivir has a higher selective index compared to GS-441524.<p>Now onto what the article referred to. The authors made their in vitro studies slightly more relevant to humans by using human epithelial cells and this time actual SARS CoV and MERS CoV virus and measured EC50 and CC50 again for both GS-441524 and remdesivir. The authors report some +&#x2F;- standard deviation ranges. From intro stat, I think one of the conclusions about looking at overlapping standard deviation bars is that no conclusion can be made about whether or not the differences are statistically significant or not!

It showed it was most effective early post infection (in vitro) and it highly inhibited viral replication when viral exonuclease was knocked out (indicating that remdesivir messes with the function of that). It also showed (via serial passage experiments...basically think about it as mini-artificial selection) that nucleoside analog drugs will tend to favor the selection for two RNA-dependent RNA polymerase  mutant viruses that confer resistance to the nucleoside drugs! But they showed in the next figure that these mutant viruses have a reproductive disadvantage compared to their wild type CoV.<p>Now for my 2 cents: I think that remdesivir was favored primarily because it was being used for anti-viral treatment in Ebola virus trials...but it was falling out of favor for Ebola treatment because of other monoclonal antibody cocktail treatments that show better survival rates (ref PALM trial: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nejm.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;full&#x2F;10.1056&#x2F;NEJMoa1910993\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nejm.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;full&#x2F;10.1056&#x2F;NEJMoa1910993<\/a>).

That&#x27;s just the federal guidelines, the chemistry behind drug production, and this is something I find interesting but strongly dislike the amount of math behind physical chemistry, is intimidating. Some of the questions that need to be answered are: Does this molecule affect any enzyme? Is this enzyme hypothesized to be in a disease process? What is the structure of this molecule? How is it made? How can we make more? How can we make more more efficiently? Does this drug work in people? What&#x27;s the dose that needs to be given to have an effect? What is the dosing ranges for a given drug? What are the serious side effects? What are the moderate&#x2F;mild side effect? How is this drug cleared&#x2F;excreted?

I understand the motivations, but I think it&#x27;s flawed for two reasons:<p>1, it increases the risk for creators. While an equipment grant is extremely useful, the biggest investment (having made a couple educational videos myself) is time. Having to then limit yourself to a platform with very low user adoption is a huge risk, and harmful to creator morale if the videos struggle for an audience due to the platform.<p>2, and this ties into the first problem, it&#x27;s not good for marketing. If you look at how another Youtube competitor, Nebula, is handling this, they have creators cross-post most of their content to Youtube. Creators then advertise Nebula in their sponsorship timeslot, extolling its virtues for creator sustainability etc -- which PeerTube would greatly benefit from as many people aren&#x27;t aware of the benefit of a distributed system, or what that even means. Additionally, they upload some sort of exclusive -- either longer videos with content that wouldn&#x27;t fit on YT (LegalEagle is a good example of a channel that does this), or special long-form projects (Wendover Productions uses this model). Either way, this lets Nebula hijack Youtube&#x27;s recommendation algorithm and built in audience as essentially free advertising, as the content being uploaded to YT is being posted to Nebula anyways. Obviously many people just watch on YT and ignore Nebula as it requires a subscription, but PeerTube doesn&#x27;t and Nebula is succeeding despite that -- anecdotally, me and my fiance bought a subscription because of this strategy.<p>With that out of the way, I do love this idea and hope it gets traction regardless!"],"time":["2020-05-16 11:11:07"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["dmix"],"id":[23196263],"kids":[23196330],"parent":[23195271],"text":["I remember visiting some PeerTube sites and being turned off by the UI.

One was to use indictions, which were 15-year cycles, counting from 312 AD. There were three different varieties of indiction, each starting on a different day of the year. The other approach was to use regnal years—the reigning Roman emperor, for example, or the ruler of whichever kingdom was under discussion. This meant that in discussing conflicts between kingdoms, the date would have to be given in the regnal years of all the kings involved. Bede used both these approaches on occasion but adopted a third method as his main approach to dating: the Anno Domini method invented by Dionysius Exiguus.

OOP is just reaaaaly bad. One of this ideas that looks appealing, but doesn&#x27;t work in practice.<p>Inheritance is often a space-goat, but it&#x27;s not even such a big of a problem with OOP. Core ideas behind OOP are misguided:<p><pre><code>    Abstraction\n    Encapsulation\n    Inheritance\n    Polymorphism\n\n<\/code><\/pre>\nEncapsulation on a such a fine-grained level as each object&#x2F;class is like a person putting padlocks on each pocket, so that right hand can&#x27;t grab thing from the left pocket. The granularity of encapsulation in OOP is just sooo impractical. The right granularity for data-hiding are data-stores, layers, APIs, (micro-)services, modules, not each single little bit of data.<p>Abstractions are costly. They can&#x27;t be a goal in itself. Abstractions should be applied only where they are needed and beneficial, where benefit of adding them outweighs the cost. Similar with Inheritance and Polymorphism - they are abstractions that have a cost. Sometimes worth-it, sometimes not really.<p>Object itself is a bad idea. Passing around references to objects (data with attached behavior, instead of POD - plain-old-data) forces you to scatter your data across many tiny bits, which makes everything way more complex and slow (poor cache locality, layers and layers of indirection). Instead of passing an Id or bunch of fields, now you&#x27;re passing data plus some abstractions to manipulate it everywhere. You generally get a graph, and graphs are the most general and thus most difficult to use data-structure out there. Coordination becomes a nightmare really quickly.<p>OOP is just a busy-work, and trying to pretend that you can just play with abstraction and taxonomies and ignore the fact that effectively your software is supposed to manipulate data to give an expected result, and not be a little god-game of modeling the world.

But that poses various challenges:<p>1) Having to keep track the state of memory and registers is difficult. So programming languages were created to create an abstraction over them in the form of variables.<p>2) Programs were full of jumps that became hard to track and maintain at scale. Structured programming was created to create an abstraction over jumps in the form of control structures (sequence&#x2F;selection&#x2F;iteration&#x2F;recursion). Procedural programming was created to group statements into reusable procedures and functions.<p>3) Then, having variables around became hard to maintain as well. So then structures were created as a way to group variables that are used together.<p>But then, people understood that some procedures and functions are coupled with structures, and that some structures are supersets of other structures. And that&#x27;s how OOP was born.<p>In this mindset, I do not think OOP is a bad idea. I also do not think that the natural consequence of OOP is bad software. The problem is how the paradigm is used, not the paradigm itself.<p>The problem people are facing now is shared mutable state, which is not only a maintainability problem, but is also problematic in multithreaded software. Functional programming is a viable solution to address that problem.<p>NOTE: edited based on suggestion, since apparently I got some concepts mixed up."],"time":["2020-05-15 23:15:38"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ken"],"id":[23199620],"kids":{},"parent":[23192264],"text":["This is all awfully vague.

I&#x27;m just going to copy from a thread that I felt got to the crux of the matter with OOP.<p>----<p>One thing I hate though, in a language like Java, is when I see &quot;utility&quot; classes with static methods which take objects as parameters, then perform some calculation based entirely on the state of the passed in object. In my opinion, if the object can reason about its own state and return an answer based on that reasoning, that method&#x2F;logic should be in the object, not elsewhere.<p>Another one that bothers me are these transformation static methods which take type A and return type B based on nothing but the state of type A. The languages were talking about, C#&#x2F;Java already provide a facility for this called a constructor.<p>If the development approach is going to completely remove operational methods from data types then I&#x27;d think long and hard about using a language which supports this instead of a language, like Clojure, which does not.<p>----<p>&gt; that method&#x2F;logic should be in the object, not elsewhere<p>Only if it&#x27;s involved in preserving some object invariants, or accessing parts of its state that are abstracted away in the public interface. Otherwise, you&#x27;re breaking encapsulation by putting some logic in the object that doesn&#x27;t belong there, and making it hard to change the implementation later.<p>&gt; The languages were talking about, C#&#x2F;Java already provide a facility for this called a constructor.<p>There are sensible reasons to avoid using constructors for this, at least in the general case.<p>----<p>&gt; Only if it&#x27;s involved in preserving some object invariants, or accessing parts of its state that are abstracted away in the public interface. Otherwise, you&#x27;re breaking encapsulation by putting some logic in the object that doesn&#x27;t belong there, and making it hard to change the implementation later.<p>I&#x27;ve been pondering this thread all day, and I think this is the crux of the issue. Ideally, classes would only encapsulate state and you&#x27;d use namespaces&#x2F;modules to encapsulate functionality.

When the year came and the prophecy didn&#x27;t, thoughtful Americans sang softly in praise of themselves. The roots of liberal democracy had held. Wherever else the terror had happened, we, at least, had not been visited by Orwellian nightmares.<p>But we had forgotten that alongside Orwell&#x27;s dark vision, there was another - slightly older, slightly less well known, equally chilling: Aldous Huxley&#x27;s Brave New World. Contrary to common belief even among the educated, Huxley and Orwell did not prophesy the same thing. Orwell warns that we will be overcome by an externally imposed oppression. But in Huxley&#x27;s vision, no Big Brother is required to deprive people of their autonomy, maturity and history. As he saw it, people will come to love their oppression, to adore the technologies that undo their capacities to think.<p>What Orwell feared were those who would ban books. What Huxley feared was that there would be no reason to ban a book, for there would be no one who wanted to read one. Orwell feared those who would deprive us of information. Huxley feared those who would give us so much that we would be reduced to passivity and egoism. Orwell feared that the truth would be concealed from us. Huxley feared the truth would be drowned in a sea of irrelevance. Orwell feared we would become a captive culture. Huxley feared we would become a trivial culture, preoccupied with some equivalent of the feelies, the orgy porgy, and the centrifugal bumblepuppy.<p>As Huxley remarked in Brave New World Revisited, the civil libertarians and rationalists who are ever on the alert to oppose tyranny &quot;failed to take into account man&#x27;s almost infinite appetite for distractions.&quot; In 1984, Orwell added, people are controlled by inflicting pain. In Brave New World, they are controlled by inflicting pleasure. In short, Orwell feared that what we fear will ruin us. Huxley feared that what we desire will ruin us. This book is about the possibility that Huxley, not Orwell, was right.”<p>—<p>“What Huxley teaches is that in the age of advanced technology, spiritual devastation is more likely to come from an enemy with a smiling face than from one whose countenance exudes suspicion and hate. In the Huxleyan prophecy, Big Brother does not watch us, by his choice. We watch him, by ours. There is no need for wardens or gates or Ministries of Truth. When a population becomes distracted by trivia, when cultural life is redefined as a perpetual round of entertainments, when serious public conversation becomes a form of baby-talk, when, in short, a people become an audience and their public business a vaudeville act, then a nation finds itself at risk; a culture-death is a clear possibility.”<p>—<p>“Huxley believed that we are in a race between education and disaster, and he wrote continuously about the necessity of our understanding the politics and epistemology of media. For in the end, he was trying to tell us that what afflicted the people in Brave New World was not that they were laughing instead of thinking, but that they did not know what they were laughing about and why they had stopped thinking.”<p>—<p>“This idea – that there is a content called “the news of the day” – was entirely created by the telegraph (and since amplified by newer media), which made it possible to move decontextualized information over vast spaces at incredible speed. The news of the day is a figment of our technological imagination. It is quite, precisely, a media event. We attend to fragments of events from all over the world because we have multiple media whose forms are well suited to fragmented conversation.”<p>—<p>“Together, this new ensemble of electronic techniques called into being a new world – a peek-a-boo world, where now this event, now that, pops into view for a moment, then vanishes again. It is a world without much coherence or sense; a world that does not ask us, indeed, does not permit us to do anything; a world that is, like the child&#x27;s game of peek-a-boo, entirely self-contained.
