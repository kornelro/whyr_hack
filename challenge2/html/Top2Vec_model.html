/* This file is a compatability layer.  It allows the usage of flexible box 
model layouts accross multiple browsers, including older browsers.  The newest,
universal implementation of the flexible box model is used when available (see
`Modern browsers` comments below).  Browsers that are known to implement this 
new spec completely include:

    Firefox 28.0+
    Chrome 29.0+
    Internet Explorer 11+ 
    Opera 17.0+

Browsers not listed, including Safari, are supported via the styling under the

<pre>[&#39;It wasn\&#39;t just me!Though it was interesting that googling &#34;google sheets down&#34; and clicking News returned 3 results regarding winter weather bedding and 0 results about Google Sheets.&#39;,
 &#39;up for me now. Google SREs must be busy today!&#39;,
 &#39;Drive is down as well.&#39;,
 &#39;Seems like they got it up quickly. But would still love to read a post-mortem.&#39;,
 &#39;So were portions of Google Slides. I could not open some slide decks, while others were unaffected. This made me sweat as I was 15 minutes away from a very important presentation.&#39;,
 &#39;Google Docs, Drive, and Photos all seem to be affected.Currently have to download my files from Google and work on them in Excel and Word to get work done.&#39;,
 &#39;Google Docs is having some issues too.&#39;,
 &#39;I\x92m having issues with web version of Google Calendar as well.&#39;,
 &#34;hmm I had assumed it&#39;s our firewall freaking out. Got warnings about unusual traffic that looked more well FW like.Drive stayed up for us though&#34;,
 &#34;An aside, but what do you do when your Google Sheet becomes too big?I find things break down very quickly (based on number of collaborators or file size), and I&#39;m writing (yet again) some type of Flask-Admin server. Retool (https://retool.com) is another option I&#39;ve considered.Any others?&#34;,
 &#34;very disappointing for those of us who like to download 200MB of javascript that pilfers our data just to do something we could&#39;ve done 30 years ago&#34;,
 &#34;I dont remember Google&#39;s Search Engine had outages. ( May be once in the past 10 years ) Why is it all the other products, from GCP to Google Sheet had more outages?And Google was suppose to compete with Microsoft Azure or Office 365?&#34;,
 &#39;Note that Rosenhan was a social psychologist. The list of faulty or outright fraudulent experiments done by psychologists grows ever longer. The entire field seems bankrupt to me. Part of the problem are perverse incentives. Get one positive and interesting result (which you can tailor to the zeitgeist for maximum impact) and you can live off books, TED talks and lectures for your whole life. Recent examples include power posing and confidence [1] (poor experiment) or changing political bias regarding gay rights [2] (outright fraud).If psychology wants the status and rewards of being considered a legitimate science, it needs to make dramatic changes. In the meantime any initial result psychological research produces must be considered not just preliminary, but suspect.[1] https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_posing\n[2] https://science.sciencemag.org/content/348/6239/1100.2&#39;,
 &#34;While this is fascinating and I&#39;m glad to have read it, it doesn&#39;t substantiate that this experiment set back psychiatry. The fact that the DSM-IV was prompted or encouraged by the experiment is suggested, but there&#39;s no argument for it. Even beyond that, the article doesn&#39;t even hint at an argument that the DSM-IV set back psychiatry (except offering the bare assertion that reductionism is false).Of course, the DSM is very controversial, and many people could fill in the argument, but this article doesn&#39;t do it.&#34;,
 &#39;The experiment sounds plausible, whether or not it happened or was done properly. But the claimed response of the hospitals also sounds perfectly reasonable to me. What do people expect?A virtually infinite number of things can cause symptoms which have some overlap with schizophrenia, and that\&#39;s why today (I\&#39;m not an expert, but I\&#39;m assuming what I know of is representative) on intake they classify someone as &#34;schizophreniform&#34; - apparently a fancy way to say &#34;looks like/might be schizophrenia&#34; without committing to anything.For every person that has a chronic condition, there are going to be many that have one episode and it never recurs. Maybe it was a virus. Maybe they had some weird allergic reaction. Hospitals are never going to know for sure what\&#39;s wrong with everyone, so the humane thing is not to insist they determine whether the remainder is &#34;real&#34; or not.Being involuntarily admitted as a psych patient has permanent consequences, and it\&#39;s uncomfortable to think about someone who doesn\&#39;t &#34;deserve&#34; the stigma being caught up in it. I think an obsession with this scenario drives the people who crusade against psychiatry. But putting more pressure on medical professionals to always get it right is only liable to make things worse. You can\&#39;t get better results by applying thumbscrews to people who genuinely try their best to deal with a fundamentally intractable problem.This did jump out at me:&#34;then, as now, no scans, no blood tests, no laboratory findings allowed them to distinguish the mad from the sane&#34;In the 21st century, I believe hospitals in the US typically screen for likely drugs first, when someone appears to have psychotic symptoms. But they also (at least where I know about) do pretty comprehensive blood tests that show clear metabolic abnormalities and then just discard the results when they don\&#39;t know what it means. So in a sense, sure, there\&#39;s no blood test for mental symptoms, and yet if positive tests for various things are routinely met with a shrug and typical psychotropic drugs administered, then the statement is misleading.&#39;,
 &#34;Hm, the experiment took place before 1973 and involved 8 pseudo-patients, all anonymous. This person was able to deanonymize and locate 3 of the pseudo-patients. Because they didn&#39;t find all 8 they then claim the study was fraudulent and never involved 8 people. That seems an absurd conclusion. It&#39;s not reasonable to think one could find all the anonymous/identity cloaked participants in a nearly 50 year old study.&#34;,
 &#39;Thoughts:The problem of false priors, deliberate misdirection, and motivated reasoning are insidious.  Having to un-learn false models is difficult and expensive, personally, bit especially socially.Even if Rosenhan\&#39;s experiment was a fraud, the notion that psychiatric institutions or the field of psychology does not engage in the practice of arbitrary, thinly-supported, or entirely fictitious diagnosis, or failure to account for changes in condition, at least at times isn\&#39;t disproved.  And ... at least to my lay understanding ... this does seem to manifest elsewhere than in Rosenhan\&#39;s accounts.There are two competing sets of motivated reasoning to be considered here, which makes determination of ground truth that much more difficult.On false priors, I\&#39;ve been familiar for a time with the notion of &#34;Wittgenstein\&#39;s Ladder&#34;, a/k/a &#34;Lies told to children&#34; (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wittgenstein%27s_ladder):My propositions serve as elucidations in the following way: anyone who understands me eventually recognizes them as nonsensical, when he has used them\x97as steps\x97to climb beyond them. (He must, so to speak, throw away the ladder after he has climbed up it.)He must transcend these propositions, and then he will see the world aright.-- Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus 6.54This leads to the challenge over time of finding oneself having climbed the ladder, but in discussions with others, constantly confronted with it, and having to explain around or over it.  Wittgenstein\&#39;s Ladder becomes, when erected horizontally across a passage of understanding rather than vertically to greater heights or across gulfs, Wittgenstein\&#39;s Barricade.It\&#39;s this constant having-to-retread-fundamentals which seems to actively impede further development of knowledge and understanding, and which I\&#39;ve found increasingly intolerable in much popular media and discussion.  Worse when it\&#39;s not even the fundamentals which are being retread, but someone\&#39;s self-serving current reformulation (often worse than the original).  See Schopenhauer\&#39;s &#34;On Authorship&#34;.&#39;,
 &#39;Perhaps more disturbing than getting a mental illness diagnosis (correct or not) is that there is no scientific way to prove that you are cured.&#39;,
 &#39;wikipedia link to get summary https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosenhan_experiment&#39;,
 &#34;This is the first time I&#39;m hearing that it was a hoax from the start. I&#39;ve heard this study referenced more times than I can count in discussions on mental illness and mental hospitals. Could it really be that it was complete horseshit?&#34;,
 &#39;The fact is psychiatry today still lacks tests or any proof of its claims of &#34;chemical imbalance&#34;, which remains unproven. No one had established a profile for what a &#34;balanced brain chemistry&#34;looks like, nor do they test for any brain chemistry imbalance.Diagnosis is still left to the subjective assessment of the practitioner before prescribing powerful psychotropics that DO change brain chemistry in unpredictable ways, and cause a host of side effects often worse than the original symptoms.So the argument today that psychiatry lacks any scientific basis and rigor for its practices is still very valid and legitimate.&#39;,

 &#39;Yet annotating a necessarily positive correlation with female participation and poor scientific development over the last five decades is considered misogynist. The intuition that is controversial is in the consideration of sexual dimorphism and novel sexual selective pressures that now influence research, ie glamour and agreeableness (\x93trendiness\x94) versus truth which is always in antagonism with the status quo. It is risible to think a woman could be as audacious as a Galileo or Heaviside (please do not deceive yourselves or feign ignorance on the effects of testosterone in the biological kingdom), and I think the poor scientific marksmanship astutely reflects this, albeit insufficiently (as academic dogmatism has other metabolic components besides sexuality which make it pale to its aristocratic genealogy.)&#39;,
 &#34;&gt; set back psychiatry for decadesMilgram, Zimbardo all these experiments from the 50&#39;s onwards are junk. Doesn&#39;t mean it set back psychiatry.How psychiatry works is you get something that you intuitively think is true, make up a experiment to prove it (so it&#39;s ok for others to agree without getting in trouble)Then consensuses decides.It&#39;s blockchain.&#34;,
 &#34;I was at a car dealership with a friend last summer and the car salesman was scrolling through a huge list of car ads on a webpage trying to find the car my friend wanted to test drive. He was getting exasperated that he could not find the car and was openly lamenting how this was always such a problem for them.I showed him how to use Ctrl F to search for the VIN number (which my friend had) and the car salesman seemed amazed. As we were leaving, he told me that he wrote that &#39;trick&#39; down and plans to show it to all the others as it will save them a lot of time scrolling through pages of results. Granted, this was an older salesman (50s to 60s) but I was somewhat surprised that no one had ever taught him that or that he had never tried to figure out a better way.As technologists, we make assumptions that don&#39;t always hold. Before this, I just assumed that everyone knew how to quickly search a webpage for text.&#34;,
 &#39;Tldr: Mr. Caulfield is upset that seemingly not enough people use control-F (or command-F on Macs) to quickly check whether a webpage actually says what another person linking to it claims it does.He claims that 90% to 96% of people don\x92t know what control-F does; his estimate of 90% is based on the results of a survey done nearly ten years ago (one of those terrible annoying Google surveys that everyone clicks through as quickly as possible with random answers to unlock access to the webpage or video they are actually trying to view), and his estimate of 96% is based on assumptions from looking over the shoulders of his students to witness how they behave, although maybe they\x92re just nervous because he\x92s watching them and they want to look like they\x92re taking the material more seriously so they start reading more intently instead of \x93cheating\x94 with control-F.Regardless of whether people actually know about using control-F on websites or not, I think reliance on it for fact-checking will actually start to cause serious problems. All of these terrible Web 4.0 page scrolling hypermanagers that completely remove DOM content located outside of the current scroll view often make control-F fail to find content that is actually on the page. Reddit does this now; you need to use old.reddit.com for control-F to actually work. Twitter does this now; good luck using control-F to scroll back up to that specific tweet in a 300 tweet chain which you only remember a few words from, you can\x92t do it anymore. A lot of news sites do this now.&#39;,
 &#34;This guy has great intentions, but he himself admits that the reason that inflammatory stuff gets spread is because low-effort readers retweet or share things without clicking through and reading the actual articles. And using Ctrl+F is less effort than reading an entire article, but it&#39;s still much, much more effort than just hitting retweet. Especially if the thing you&#39;re retweeting is something that you want to boost because it reinforces your preconceptions. Why would you want to fact-check something like that?Ctrl+F is nice, but it&#39;s definitely not gonna solve the problem he&#39;s pointing to.&#34;,
 &#39;One oft ignored impact of Bahaus is the impact it had on how design taught. Amongst other things Bauhaus introduced the first cross disaplinary program  (both applied and fine art) and the now ubiquitous foundation year (the first year of a design school).&#39;,
 &#39;The actual collection itself is available at https://www.harvardartmuseums.org/publications/special-colle... \nThe timeline view (with examples!) in particular is very interesting to see how specific features became to be so deeply associated with the movement. At https://www.harvardartmuseums.org/tour/the-bauhaus/slide/633...&#39;,
 &#39;For everyone interested in Bauhaus and several related styles, I recommend exploring monoskop.org.&#39;,
 &#39;The Danish Design Museum had an exhibition on it recently. Maybe it\x92s still there?So if you want to have an excuse to go to Copenhagen, here it is!&#39;,
 &#39;It\x92s interesting to watch the response to this crisis ricochet around the world. Results come from China, the CDC sequences the virus from the Chicago and Seattle patients and releases them, researchers in Seattle process the merged data through their open source tool[0]. Researchers in China then translate these results to Chinese [1]The internet is our immune system.[0] https://twitter.com/nextstrain/status/1221181133884256256?s=...[1]  https://mobile.twitter.com/nextstrain/status/122154827481917...&#39;,
 &#34;&gt; 27 (66%) patients had direct exposure to Huanan seafood market (figure 1B https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6...). Market exposure was similar between the patients with ICU care (nine [69%]) and those with non-ICU care (18 [64%]). The symptom onset date of the first patient identified was Dec 1, 2019. None of his family members developed fever or any respiratory symptoms. No epidemiological link was found between the first patient and later cases.The idea I think was that the strain originated at the market, from people handling and possibly consuming bats. But, the description above and figure 1B indicates the currently known patient 0 was not exposed to the market.Also, what is the chance that a random person in the area has exposure to that market in say a week&#39;s time. If it is a central place in the city, and depending on the layout and public transportation, 60% weekly exposure to it might not be unusual for an average citizen there.It maybe be conspiracy at this point but I find it highly suspicious that out of all the markets in the country, this epidemic started just around the corner from China&#39;s first (and only?) biosafety level 4 laboratory https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/25/5/18-0220_article, which just happened to have been built in response to the 2003 SARS epidemic, and so presumably has been working with those kind of viruses since.&#34;,
 &#39;&gt; &#34;Suspected patients were isolated using airborne precautions in the designated hospital, Jin Yin-tan Hospital (Wuhan, China), and fit-tested N95 masks and airborne precautions for aerosol-generating procedures were taken.&gt; This study was approved by the National Health Commission of China and Ethics Commission of Jin Yin-tan Hospital (KY-2020-01.01).&gt; Written informed consent was waived by the Ethics Commission of the designated hospital for emerging infectious diseases.&#34;In other words, data from every patient they had is reported in this paper, with or without their consent. That includes radiographic imaging, blood and respiratory specimens, including nasal and pharyngeal swabs, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, sputum, and/or bronchial aspirates.In a western country, one of the tenants of medical ethics is that, if you have capacity to consent, you can always refuse to give it. In my country, I would be personally liable for assault if I (invasively) collected these samples from patients _without_ their explicit consent.It must be a terrifying situation to be in: sick, in respiratory distress, and isolated from your family and friends in a large hospital, surrounded only by presumably somewhat scared looking medical professionals wearing tightly fitting face masks. I just hope that patients were _verbally_ asked if they consented to the collection of bronchoscopy-obtained samples for research and hopefully their diagnosis and management: it is an unpleasant procedure that, like many things in medicine, carries a small but non-zero risk of serious injury or death.&#39;,
 &#39;I am impressed how fast Chinese scientists developed a genetic test distinguish 2019-coronavirus from other kinds of pneumonia. I am old enough to remember biologists flailing around for 4 years to identify the HIV virus and two years more for slow (two week) test.&#39;,
 &#39;Of the initial 41 patients, 13 were admitted to ICU and 6 died(15%). This is the data the news has been missing and shows why China is taking this so seriously.&#39;,
 &#39;My wife just pointed out what might be a spurious anecdote: no Caucasians died during the SARS epidemic in 2003, and none have died so far in response to this novel virus. Is there any data to back this up?(She was in Beijing during 2003, and saw SARS first hand)&#39;,
 &#34;It would be interesting to see less accurate statistics on the total CURRENT number of cases rather than this OLD NEWS. Cool for whoever published that, but we need more focus on speed of information dissemination, even prioritising it over accurracy, we&#39;re moving at pre-Internet pace here or someone is actively hindering the flow of info...&#34;,
 &#34;We have 2700 confirmed cases, 80 dead. Some also in the West and we are still talking about these initial 41?Are we a pre or post internet civilisation?Honestly 4chan is doing better than this. Reading through their noise is better than the clean data coming out of the officials. For example they have people in pools of blood on the street with people in the bio suits China are using.Maybe it&#39;s obvious people will throw up blood with this new SARS, but the officials aren&#39;t mentioning it. Sperm may contain the virus for months. Again obvious, not seeing it on official feeds.&#34;,
 &#39;A must-read piece for people trying to understand language design theoretics. The paper clearly talks about all the perspectives around the word type, and then discusses the ambiguity in the usage of the term.Was very helpful to decrypt what people mean by type under different contexts.&#39;,
 &#34;For a while, I felt the same thing. I commented about it here: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21788429I am not sure how my classification maps to that of author&#39;s. In particular, I think his classification omits dynamic dispatch.&#34;,
 &#39;&gt; During the recruiting process, Fils-Aimé asked to speak directly with Nintendo of Japan\&#39;s Global president at the time, Satoru Iwata, before accepting any job. &#34;It is not something they had planned to do,&#34; he told Present Value. &#34;I learned later on, it caused quite a bit of issues within Nintendo. \&#39;Who is this person asking to meet with our global president?\&#39;&#34; This phone interview with Iwata-san was eventually scheduled and originally meant to last 30 minutes. It exceeded 90, Fils-Aimé said.Nintendo Japan thought it was weird that a potential President of Nintendo of America would want to speak to what sounds like would be his primary superior? Am I reading that right?&#39;,
 &#39;Seems like a strange argument, to claim that Nintendo\&#39;s logotype would even be eligible for a &#34;modernization&#34;. The vast majority of logos follow the same mold when they are modernized: they are simplified, rendered in sharp vector art, are made to look good even in monochrome, may use contemporary fonts instead that match this style, and so on. Microsoft\&#39;s window is an example of this, Firefox is another. The thing about Nintendo\&#39;s logo is that it already looks like that. Like the logo of IBM, it\&#39;s already modern, because it\&#39;s timeless.&#39;,
 &#39;Like Sony, I find that Nintendo\&#39;s logo is pretty much timeless.I think that the very nature of being employed to do a job makes it harder than not to resist doing anything. I mentioned this the other day with regards to A B testing. It feels odd to do all that work and conclude with: do nothing.I think this is exactly why you need someone like Reggie at that level of the process. As an executive he\&#39;s more resilient to the sense of need to do something, anything, given how much time and money you put into the project. This is also why you need someone who lives and breathes your product. Not just generic executive cog in a suit.I had three arborists in my forest last year. They all had opinions on what to do and they were all different. Probably because I\&#39;m paying them to have an opinion and &#34;don\&#39;t do anything&#34; feels like you\&#39;re cheating someone of their cash.&#39;,
 &#39;Nintendo\&#39;s corporate logo has been consistent and predates the company\&#39;s pivot to video games. But each console they\&#39;ve released has had its own logo, many of which have incorporated the word &#34;Nintendo&#34;. So while this is accurate from a corporate standpoint, Nintendo fans have seen the company rebranded in a variety of fonts over the years. To many gamers\&#39; sensibilities, the official logo is actually retro, and reminiscent of the NES era.&#39;,
 &#39;A quote from Steve Jobs on the design of the NeXT logo:&#34;Most companies have their logo as just a logotype. And every once in a while a company has a logo that\&#39;s sort of  a little jewel, a symbol, that can be used independently of the logotype.&#34; [1]Personally, I think Nintendo\&#39;s logo is somewhat the Mickey Mouse symbol of video games. I\&#39;m glad they didn\&#39;t change it, because when I see it I associate it with the quality and holistic design they\&#39;re known for.[1] https://youtu.be/qw7VrZSAUEU?t=41&#39;,
 &#34;As silly as graffiti Nintendo logos seem to us now, when the brand is nearly as stable in the West as IBM or Chevrolet, back in the 90s Sega was eating Nintendo&#39;s lunch with its focus on being edgy and extreme and lax attitudes to violent and other content. Nintendo capitulated on the content standards, and for a time it would have been canny business strategy to add edge to the brand also. The 90s were very, very weird. A timeless brand turned out perhaps to have been the wiser decision after all, as Sega left the console market and became part of a pachinko conglomerate. And they still can&#39;t get Sonic exactly right.&#34;,
 &#39;This guy has an amazing last name. Fils-Aimé is French for beloved son.&#39;,
 &#39;Japanese logos tend to be quite &#34;timeless&#34;, mostly because they\&#39;re so minimalist (think Mitsubishi logo). Even towns and prefectures have very simple emblems instead of a complicated coat of arms.https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Emblem_of_Fukushima_...&#39;,
 &#39;in this day and age of constant reinvention, I find that stability is of utmost value&#39;,
 &#39;Man the writing really sucks at Ars Technica these days. Thanks for reminding me why I quit reading after Condé Nast took over.&#39;,
 &#39;TIL I learned that the oval in the Nintendo logo was supposed to be a racetrack. I never realized that before.&#39;,
 &#34;Does anyone actually need to do this? Doesn&#39;t interoping in the other direction (calling D from R) at least make a bit more sense?&#34;,
 &#34;AMP must be included in the investigation. Google&#39;s latest tactic is the introduction of Signed HTTP Exchanges [1], which still forces publishers to create AMP sites that are delivered from a Google server in order to appear at the top of Google Search results.Nobody should not be forced to create AMP sites in order to appear at the top of search results.Mozilla opposes the implementation of the Web Packaging specification [2], which includes Signed HTTP Exchanges, mainly because it can be used to take away control from publishers over the distribution of content.&gt; The question remains about whether this fundamental change to the way that content is delivered on the web represents a problematic shift in the power balance between actors. We have to consider whether aggregators could use this technology to impose their will on publishers.If you&#39;re from the US, please write to your representatives and let them know about AMP.[1] https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/11/signed-exc...[2] https://www.iab.org/wp-content/IAB-uploads/2019/06/mozilla.p...&#34;,
 &#39;Google &amp; FB threaten the political hold of the status quo.I\x92m neither this way or that on them or whatever, someone always knows at this point and this crowd helps them find out for a living.It\x92s interesting how when it was them buying and trading is without knowing, all was cool.Now their algorithms may be pushing the other sides politics more than mine? Investigate!!!Government has the power to kowtow the elites. If only the people would wield that for themselves.&#39;,
 &#39;Does anyone know if this typical or atypical for anti-competitive investigations?&#39;,
 &#39;I never understood why the standup cant just be an asynchronous chat room. The information is easier to review and follow up on, and people can check in when its not a disruption. My gut feeling is, at most places, 90% of the purpose is for the pm to feel like the captain of the ship, and 10% is an attendance check.&#39;,
 &#39;I have been an engineer or in engineering leadership most of my life. Now CTO of a large company. Nobody wants to say it out loud, but what we really need to do is treat engineers with respect. Give them a quiet place to work and leave them the fuck alone. Agile is just a watered-down compromise. We still get to have project managers, we just call them scrummasters and they get to bother the engineers slightly less.&#39;,
 &#39;Once had a daily standup with 30-35 employees, all different teams and projects, and no one enforcing brevity (going down the rabbit whole was common). The whole exercise felt like taking attendance. After the one senior person who insisted on them left, we dropped them immediately with no negative consequences.&#39;,
 &#34;I think that the people who don&#39;t like standups, are the people who have never been a part of one that works well.  This isn&#39;t surprising, because most don&#39;t work well.There are two critical things that a leader must do to run an effective standup:1. You must have a leader who is willing to enforce the rules in order to effectively extract the right information to support managerial tasks (and not arbitrarily, but through team buy-in), and2. They must be willing and able to understand most of the technical intricacies of the tasks taking place.In my experience, most organizations&#39; standups are run by people who fail at one or both of these.Maybe they&#39;ll put in a PM who enforces the rules, but doesn&#39;t understand (or doesn&#39;t care to understand) the tasks the developers are doing with enough detail to be an effective facilitator.  They act as a note-taker, letting the developers manage themselves ad-hoc, and don&#39;t ask questions unless someone specifically brings up a blocker.  This can work with a team 100% full of self-starters who are comfortable with asking hard questions of each other, but that&#39;s your only hope.Or on the opposite side of the spectrum, you have organizations that put more senior developers in that role.  Then, you often end up going down design rabbit holes until you&#39;ve run out of time, and you never end up doing the tasks that you actually needed to do: planning everyone&#39;s time effectively, and recording/communicating progress so that stakeholders expectations are correctly managed.In both of those failure cases, you end up failing to deliver a quality product on time and/or fail to communicate expectations to stakeholders.  In the first case, you made a plan, but it wasn&#39;t a full picture.  In the second failure case, you had all of the right tasks figured out, but you failed to plan and communicate it.&#34;,
 &#34;Yesterday I did a thing, Today I am doing a thing and currently I am or not able to do that thing.For me the main problem with stand-ups, especially when they are more than 2 times a week, is that they make it impossible to do lengthy unstructured work.  It&#39;s embarrassing to say that you worked on something and didn&#39;t get anywhere.  My theory is that max task size becomes the length of time between standups in most orgs.&#34;,
 &#39;As with anything &#34;agile&#34;, it pays to stop and take stock of how your processes actually address the 4 key agile principals:- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools- Working software over comprehensive documentation- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation- Responding to change over following a planI personally interpret &#34;individuals and interactions over processes and tools&#34; as a warning against the snake oil and magic bullets that agile consultants sold / are selling to corporations.Standups are not at all a bad idea, but I feel like most implementations are simply a response to a prescription rather than a symptom. Nor do I feel like the prescription is particularly effective: rather than using the structure of a standup you could just, of your own volition - when useful; take an interest in your teammates\&#39; work, talk to them, and collaboratively come up with a solution.&#39;,
 &#34;Excluding QA wasn&#39;t a plus. Quality works better when there&#39;s an advocate from the beginning.Problem is a lot of companies only engage QA for post-build integration testing. They try to phase it as a mini-waterfall within the agile cycles, which doesn&#39;t play well with agile and drags the process. At that point, leaving them to their own horizontal meetings seems like a plus, but there&#39;s a ton of opportunity cost for not having them in the primary conversation.Other companies try to leverage QA for unit tests, but those really should be written by whoever wrote the interface as part of ensuring their intended contracts are fulfilled. That makes unit test writing not really a good QA role, other than making sure they&#39;re there.The exception would be if you&#39;re going to pull QA in and pair-program/test TDD style--which is its own potential boondoggle. But you need real SDETs at that point, as opposed to scripters. Real SDETs aren&#39;t terribly common, and are not terribly cheap as they&#39;re niche specialists.The best solution I&#39;ve seen is to split the advocacy/short-term roles and the test/architecture/long-term development roles (even if it&#39;s two hats on one person), have them in the meeting for the former and have the horizontal run their own projects with milestone syncs for the latter.At that point you can treat the short-term role as a team member, and the long-term roles as an internal vendor or external dependency (i.e. no expectation of control). Any sort of one-size-fits-all approach won&#39;t work.&#34;,
 &#39;How can you verify that your standups are effective? After the standup, take 2 random members and ask them to describe each other updates.You will be surprised with the results.&#39;,
 &#34;The primary purpose of a standup seems to be a forcing function. It forces developers to make progress. The embarrassment factor of having to admit you did not finish your tasks for the day is what drives these meetings. I&#39;ve been through the grind on both sides: as a developer and as a manager. I thoroughly detest stand-ups. When I started my company, I decided not to do them. I have a one-on-one with each developer everyday to understand progress. I don&#39;t ask for progress reports, since I can see their commit history. This seems to more effective than wasting their time and mine in a pointless meeting.  I still do stand-ups with sales people though. They seem to like the camaraderie of the big meeting.&#34;,
 &#34;I&#39;d honestly take a pay cut for a private office and maybe 1x standups.&#34;,
 &#34;Standups ain&#39;t that bad when they are short and to the point and honest. Being honest that something may take longer than it was estimated for should be okay. But people make it a big deal, that if it takes even a few days more, you are incompetent. So participants chose not to share that details and there is miscommunication or bugs or both.Also, an important note. Even if there was a standup, it&#39;s ok to talk more in detail about the tasks/tickets after it, during a day. People seem to forget it and make the stantups far too long for everyone to hold one&#39;s attention until the end.&#34;,
 &#39;I\&#39;m in a software leadership role.I\&#39;m currently involved in several, what I like to call, &#34;dead standups&#34;. Zombie\&#39;s could give an update and no one would bat an eyelash.Stand up can be useful if there is an effective leader. I\&#39;m actively trying to identify these characteristics and implement on the teams for where I am involved with the goal to cultivate/develop/train people to make these stand up meetings useful. Because we all know a dead standup is where productivity goes to die.I\&#39;ll have to share my results. Tomorrow, I hope someone asks me for an update on my progress ; )&#39;,
 &#39;His Ugly and Bad aren\&#39;t that bad! I\&#39;d be happy if those were my standups.Right now for me, the project managers own the whole event. You are asked for an update on a task that is on the project managers list, you give your update, and then he moves on to the next guy. There is only one developer in the meeting (me). The rest are QA, BA, Product Management, Delivery Management, and Change Management staff.The developers who work under me will get prodded randomly throughout the day by various other project managers for their updates.This is what happens when your company is &#34;project oriented&#34;.&#39;,
 &#39;The whole point of a stand up (daily scrum) is to discuss how work is progressing towards a sprint goal. If it devolves into a card-by-card status update meeting, it loses its value.It is nothing more than the dev team coming together to discuss how to move forward towards the goal. No one else should be at the meeting. If further detailed discussion is needed, save it for afterwards.&#39;,
 &#39;Good post, nice roundup of some of the ways standups can go wrong and right.I do think it skipped a common severe corruption of the daily standup, which is a daily application of micromanagement  and deadline pressures.I\x92ve heard about successful daily scrum meetings but I now believe the inherent chemical instability of this practice makes it too dangerous for all but a few very disciplined teams and only when absolutely necessary.To me, scrum is the nitroglycerin of management methodologies. People who think they can handle it safely probably can\x92t. It\x92s wildly tempting for managers or stakeholders who are concerned with deadlines to hijack the meetings&#39;,
 &#39;I generally find that the duration of standups scales O(n^2) with the number of participants.&#39;,
 &#34;Remember, it&#39;s a called a standup because it&#39;s a comedy.(I genuinely thought the article was gonna be about comedy. I was disappointed.)&#34;,
 &#39;The only workable way to do stand ups is not to stand at all, but make everyone hold the plank position. The meeting ends when the scrummaster collapses.&#39;,
 &#39;If I use Docker, I get to put &#34;Docker&#34; on my resume for the next job; if I use bash scripts I don\&#39;t.\nIf I use React, I get to put &#34;React&#34; on my resume; if I use vanilla JS I don\&#39;t.\nIf I use Kubernetes, I get to put &#34;Kubernetes&#34; on my resume.\nIf I use AWS, I get to put that on my resume, if I just spin up a Linux instance using Linode or etc, I don\&#39;t\nOf course, I would have to convince my boss to let me do all of these.  But, he also wants to be able to put on his resume that he managed developers who used these things, so that\&#39;s an easy task.\nMany of these made perfect sense for the FAANG company they were developed for, but they are used at companies with 0.01% of the number of servers of those companies, and the basic reason is that both devs and managers want to pretend they are working at FAANG, so that someday they will work there.Again, there are valid use cases for all of these, but there are also valid use cases for semi tractor trailers.  It doesn\&#39;t mean I should use one to get my groceries.&#39;,
 &#39;Oh geez, having a team of 24 engineers across multiple countries trying to maintain a common set of bash scripts that work for 12+ unique services sounds like a disaster.Instead we have a single workflow for docker, whether it\&#39;s going out to AWS or Kubernetes and all the services use an identical flow. Integration testing is a cinch since it\&#39;s running actual, version matched postgres/redis/etc on the CI nodes which get spun up on demand and against the same docker image that\&#39;ll get pushed out to production.We haven\&#39;t had a case of &#34;Well it works on my machine why doesn\&#39;t it work on yours!?&#34; in a really long time since if it works in docker.. well it works in docker.&#39;,
 &#39;The author has the boldness of saying that anything that does not produce a single artifact (golang binary or fatjar) is a language that should not be used an that they were errors of the past and we should get rid of them (citing explicitly PHP, Ruby and Python).Now, if we want to think that languages and whole ecosystems (libraries, bugs and edge cases fixed, developers and companies whose code base is written in such language) can be changed easily, then the author take on Docker is right. In such a world Docker doesn\&#39;t add anything useful. But the real world is quite different and it\&#39;s not going to change for the author, so Docker (or &#34;containers&#34;) is still adding something valuable and it\&#39;s not a &#34;bet&#34; to me, at all.&#39;,
 &#39;The author\&#39;s approach presupposes a devops &#34;person&#34; (side note: if you have a person in charge of ops, that person is an ops person, not a &#34;devops&#34; person, as devops is a process; either your org is on it or they aren\&#39;t). If you want developers to launch to production with any degree of reliability, you\&#39;re going to need either a lot of tooling support for your specific workflow, or you\&#39;re going to use docker and a significant degree of creative blindness. The fat binary approach works great if you can build a fat binary - python and node are nearly diametrically opposed to compiled binaries in general, much less ones that include a list of dependencies. The docker image is the fat binary that our toolchain is set up to build and run.&#39;,
 &#34;I completely agree.  My team has spent the last several years building software we then deploy with Docker and Kubernetes, and looking back I think that our software would have been much better deployed as statically-linked binaries on simple Linux servers.We&#39;re writing in Go, which means we already have the statically-linked binaries, which means we have a single file which needs to get deployed.  What does Docker buy us?  \x85 a single file which gets deployed.  We could get the same effect of Docker Hub by just scping versioned binaries.Kubernetes is far worse, of course.  It is an amazing ramshackle collection of disparate, ill-fitting parts which make everything &#39;easy&#39; but nothing simple.  It does buy us some useful things, but I don&#39;t think they are worth the cost.A bunch of EC2 nodes running Debian, with a few dozen-line shell scripts to copy binaries around, would completely replace our usage of Docker and Kubernetes and drastically reduce the complexity of our system.  We just don&#39;t need a lot of what Kubernetes does (no doubt others do), but we have to pay for it in complexity anyway.I really do believe that in the future we will see a few companies be very successful by foregoing Docker + Kubernetes + Helm (yo dude, I heard your YAML was giving you problems so here&#39;s some more YAML to YAML your YAML into YAMLy submission!), and then a few years later we will all look back at this mess a little bit like people look at the Pet Rock craze.&#34;,
 &#34;I have to agree a little bit.. \nOne other thing that bothers me is when I don&#39;t WANT to run docker. Some packages/services actually make it tricky to achieve this. With some time being spent reversen engineering.Docker is cool don&#39;t get me wrong, but it might be a bit over used sometimes. And I really don&#39;t think it needs to be this 1 way solution to everything.&#34;,
 &#34;Docker may be over-used, but, when managing hundreds of instances of machines, it&#39;s really useful to have deploys/redeploys/updates:\n- Immutable (the instance is effectively frozen as an image)\n- Has dependencies baked in (don&#39;t have to worry about whether the app was run on xenial/bionic,etc.)\n- Identical (people are disincentivized to make ad-hoc modifications to instances)&#34;,
 &#39;I don\&#39;t trust people who like their software tools.  I can trust some of the people who believe that their usecase justifies the cost of a tool, as long as they can also articulate it\&#39;s limitations. If someone doesn\&#39;t understand the environment and problem a tool solves well enough to rattle off a laundry list of good, bad and ugly design decisions, then their baseline analysis doesn\&#39;t have any utility.It\&#39;s a subtle distinction, because once someone is primed that these are the two options, everyone thinks they\&#39;re in the second category.  You have to give someone enough rope and hope they offer up how much they &#34;love&#34; their toys.I like this article because the container toolset ecosystem needs criticism to evolve.  And we don\&#39;t see enough of it.&#39;,
 &#34;I notice that once you&#39;re invested, time and effort wise, in doing something one way, and it works, the general unwillingness to learn different or newer ways of doing the same things increases rapidly. Overcoming such prejudice requires understanding and accepting the incentives for further investing time and effort to accustom with newer technology.Use-case driven technology fit is just one incentive. There are other incentives like resume enhancement, participation in communities where there is rapid development, FOMO / fear of being a dinosaur, the reputation of being known as someone well versed with the latest technologies, monetization via online courses/tutorials. These are just a few I could think of, I&#39;m sure there are more.In my relatively short career, I saw this playing out with NoSql databases, microservices architecture, SPA (AngularJS), NodeJS, responsive websites, blockchain and more recently, ReactJS, data-science (AI/ML) and containerization.Each one of these, at some point or the other,  have been used in cases where the problem space was completely solvable without using said technology but was introduced for some other incentive.Say what you will but this rapid change is what makes and keeps this space moving, interesting, inspiring and well-paying.&#34;,
 &#34;Docker lets you have a standard easy to run reproducible description of a system (service + all dependencies) as code for any service. It&#39;s a fat-binary for anything that is also the build env for that binary. Not all languages support native fat-binaries and even those that do you still need a way to reproducibly build that binary (CI doesn&#39;t count because local testing builds can&#39;t reproduce it).&#34;,
 &#39;By expecting Docker users to know more than they do, the author thinks they\&#39;re dumber than they are.Docker users are mostly folks who specialize in other areas of programming, to whom Docker popularized affecting &#34;fat binaries&#34; out of PHP/Ruby/Python/node apps via chroot.  Chroot was already well known to ops folks, but was arcane to most webapp devs.We\&#39;re not ops experts who have been confounded by marketing, we\&#39;re ops amateurs for whom Docker cracked the nut of chroot legibility.The author hates on Docker in comparison to other fat binary techniques; he ignores that pro-Docker advocates are comparing it to not using fat binaries at all.&#39;,
 &#34;I would like to see more vetting in dockerhub and security in general, yes it&#39;s based on cgroups which are specifically security minded, but not all docker users are aware of this. A novice user pulling a random docker image, and running default as root is bound to cause some issues.&#34;,
 &#39;Docker (and docker-compose) is super useful for local development environments. Sure, there are problems with docker on windows and with non-root containers. But docker is way better then most of the other tools I used for this (vagrant and whatnot).A main problem in my opinion is, that old images are no longer published (or removed from dockerhub). I doubt very much, that you can build docker images that are written now in 2030.But I assume the same happens with Packer + Terraform. In both cases you need to make sure the image is saved and accessible at a place you control, because the build will stop working at some point in time. Also the nice thing about docker is, it runs local (developer machine) and in production. I am not sure how you archive that with AMIs.Building fat binaries is only easy for some specific languages and tools. In docker, it is easy for everything. At the end docker gives you a standardized way to deploy (image, environment variables, network, volumes and off you go!).Now about docker in production. I had lots of problems with that. But if you use docker for local and don\&#39;t have a ops department, it is the natural way to go. You run your integration tests with the same image that later runs on prod, so you don\&#39;t need to worry, what stack is running on in a different environment. As a developer with a fully automated CI chain, I can control the entire deployment from my IDE (Dockerfile, Jenkinsfile, ...). My college can review the entire deployment in the PR (code-changes and infrastructure changes). And also docker has for most external software a ready to use image. Those are big benefits for small dev teams in small companies.Also cloud providers offer docker tooling like a private image repository and docker support in most CI tools. I mention all of this, because the tooling around a container solution is important. You may dislike docker, but it integrates in most cloud providers and has images for almost everything.The argument about complexity is true. If something doesn\&#39;t work and you have no idea about the parts under the docker layer then its game over. But this is a very general argument against complexity. Complexity in software makes everything easy until you need to go down an abstraction layer. Nobody forces you to run your MySQL or Elasticsearch in docker container. This is definitely an unnecessary (and potentially dangerous) layer of complexity.But to run the 10 years old PHP 5 application that needs memcached version 0.1.5, docker is very very useful: you spend a week to put all that legacy stuff in an docker image, push the image and all the team members can run it locally. Even the designer that knows a bit of jquery can run &#34;docker-compose up&#34; on his windows machine.&#39;,
 &#39;Docker is the fatbinary that he is talking about. It supports all-the-languages and runs just about everywhere.The article ignores the fact that companies do not have the time, money, expertise, and desire to re-write their apps in a language that will compile down into a binary. There is a reason so many successful companies use PHP and Ruby. They work and make those businesses money. Taking a golang binary and building it into a tiny scratch docker image would be fantastic too.In a previous job we ran hundreds of bare metal machines that were built up using puppet. It was amazing in the sense that it was somewhat standardized and could scale well. I still wish every service was using docker. We had php, ruby and golang services and getting all of those dependencies running was a pain. Not only did you have specific machine images to support each language, you had to support each service type too. If they were in docker containers we could have had one machine time and moved the docker images around.&#39;,
 &#39;Plenty of companies:a) do not want to give people/scripts access to the machine.b) do not want to employ a bunch of people whose sole purpose is to manage these machines.Being able to provision (for instance) an Openshift project in a click to deploy docker containers solves those problems.Yes, those are not problems that a startup or a small business has, but these are problems that all large enterprises with sensitive data have.Docker is a standard that anyone knows. Is it the best standard? Who knows, but it is a platform and a standard that has built an ecosystem. That fact alone will make it better than any product or custom-built deployment solution that has to be maintained by a team of engineers.&#39;,
 &#39;5 years ago I dreamed that IT teams would be empowered to offer us developers a heroku-like experience. (Or JVM application server for those of you who remember those). But it seems like Kubernetes, the &#34;new shiny&#34;, has distracted them from that goal, so now they\&#39;re off in Kubernetes land reconfiguring and reconfiguring, never increasing the productivity or security of what they deliver to the rest of the company. Basically, Kubernetes has nerdsniped IT.&#39;,
 &#39;His arguments seem week. I\x92ve used both docker and k8s for couple of years now. Sure there is a learning curve but because shit is consistent and sane we\x92ve been able to have better uptimes, and our pages went significantly down(self healing and auto-scaling properties of k8s are a god send).Before we used to fab-ssh into the servers, manually ask some human at softlayer to provision new servers, bash script install things, and use native package managers like pip install. Fun fact. Pip is not deterministic. Until package-lock came, npm wasn\x92t deterministic. Things that worked in dev and staging would end up borking prod and we\x92d be serving 500s. Other language package managers had similar issues.I see docker as just a glorified package manager. Make a docker file, build an image, run the same image in prod/dev/stage for consistency.That is a huge timesaver.&#39;,
 &#34;The archive link is down and the original article is dead, so I can&#39;t read it...The comments on the article are not kind, however [1][2].1. https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/8j9yrn/docker_is_th...2. https://www.reddit.com/r/docker/comments/8jk22u/docker_is_a_...&#34;,
 &#39;This might be the most short sighted article I have ever read. One of humanity\&#39;s greatest achievements was the creation of the intermodel shipping container(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermodal_container). We literally would not live in the world of convenience we have today without it.But imagine what the curmudgeon of the day had to say about this. &#34;Why do I need to use this specific container? This container has all these problems... and on and on&#34;&#39;,
 &#39;I\&#39;m on a project that only needs a single server, and storage. Yet we have k8s, docker, 3 other needless technologies with all their ancillary requirements,Microservices and about 5 more git repos than the entirety of Google needs. Development of simple features take 5-10x of what it should be. But then I understand the developers too: recruiters and team leads urged by their developers to &#34;work on the latest tech or we\&#39;ll leave&#34; have to adopt and so ask for ppl with those skills.&#39;,
 &#34;From what I&#39;ve seen, Docker usually gets used when someone has a difficult-to-run app, usually due to many dependencies or a cryptic barely-documented jump-through-hoops-of-fire setup. So they dockerize it. Instead of trying to improve the app, they&#39;ve essentially thrown up their hands in defeat and dockerized it. Which is a legitimate strategy in many cases, but too often it&#39;s the lazy way out.&#34;,
 &#39;Oof, this didn\x92t age well. Sounds like the OP didn\x92t want to understand the benefits of Docker at scale in a large, heterogenous corporation and has stuck their head in the sand because their uses cases didn\x92t need it.&#39;,
 &#39;Discussed at the time: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17062288&#39;,
 &#39;Docker is dead and k8s is hyped up by a bunch of clueless vcs and an army of marketing monkeys called &#34;developer evangelists&#34; that get paid by the tweet. Said evangelists are people that failed at even the most jr software roles so why would anyone listen to them.&#39;,
 &#39;We should all move to Krubnernetes&#39;,
 &#34;don&#39;t gitlab/azure devops pipelines make docker irrelevant?&#34;,
 &#39;What a peculiar combination of tone of subject matter. It was ultimately an industry case study, the kind of thing that you might find in any number of general-interest magazines, except that the author feels the need to remind the reader that Capitalism is Bad every couple of paragraphs, just enough to assuage his conscience before getting back to the analysis of Amazon, B&amp;N, and the publishing industry.&#39;,
 &#39;15 years ago I would love to have had a product like this when working mechanical maintenance in a machine shop but Jesus Christ the price alone is ridiculous.  $360!?!  some shops have hundreds of machines.Back when I was in mechanical maintenance, we would wire up every machine on the floor (lathe, shave, heat treat, cymbal cutters, you name it) to Serial Comm adapters that convert the RS232 from most machines into IP/CAT5.  These only cost $80USD, and were bullet-proof enough to replace when needed.  The CAT5 lines were shielded so they were robot friendly, and went all the way to the front office where the Linux administrator had them all wired into switch panels and network servers for the guys in the QC labs.Besides, most newer CNC come with remote desktop or SSH or something remote you can use to poll them or interact with them by default.  Sometimes they even come with wifi antennas.I guess if you were building a new robot or machine, and needed a logic interface, this would be an excellent solution to a proprietary world, but as a bolt-on accessory no.&#39;,
 &#39;Incidentally, the Raspberry Pi Compute Module is indeed &#34;rather unknown&#34;, which is a shame. It is amazingly useful and lets you design devices without getting into high-complexity PCBs and BGAs. You can place an SO-DIMM socket on a simple 4-layer board (adventurous types might even go with 2 layers if you don\&#39;t need USB) and build a computing device that would otherwise be out of reach.Another added bonus is the built-in flash, which is significantly more reliable than the whole SD card setup (for many reasons). Or the two CSI ports (only one is exposed on the standalone RPi board).All in all, for anything except prototyping, this is a much better solution than a standalone RPi. In my designs, I found it to be a useful and reliable workhorse.&#39;,
 &#34;I can see a niche for these units in some IoT and small/simple control applications.  But they are close enough in price to Beckhoff&#39;s ARM-based industrial PC / PLC&#39;s that I would tend towards Beckhoff for pretty much anything I wanted to do (especially now that Beckhoff offers FreeBSD instead of windows embedded).  Note that Beckhoff offers both a hard-real-time PLC and a soft-realtime general computing environment on their PLC&#39;s.  You can program the PLC side in standard PLC languages or C/C++ (with some limits on available syntax).  On the soft-real-time side, you can pick any programming approach you want (C/C++/C#/Python/MATLAB/Labview/Elixir/TS or JS, etc.) and communicate to the hard-real-time side via a variety of options.&#34;,
 &#39;I used to work on a product that these would have been perfect for. At the time (early 2000s) we were using consumer mini-itx stuff in industrialised cases, because the true &#34;industrial&#34; stuff was all decade-old tech, or an absolute fortune (and still at least a couple years out of date).These tick a lot of useful boxes, in particular the supply voltage, DIN Mount, usb host ability (plug in a PC to be able to field service a dead unit), real-time clock, and isolated IO modules.&#39;,
 &#34;Hi, I&#39;m a kernel dev on the Revolution Pi team. AMA.&#34;,
 &#34;The DIN rail idea is very neat. I&#39;ve seen a few projects of mounting regular Pi&#39;s in server racks but DIN is a much more compact form factor. Wonder how long until someone makes a regular Pi to Din kit.&#34;,
 &#39;Ships with a non deterministic OS and is labeled for automation?It looks cool and I want to like it, but it needs a RTOS, if any at all, for automation.&#39;,
 &#34;How&#39;s the Compute Module with temperature?\nWe&#39;ve had trouble keeping Raspberry PIs (3 not 4) stable in industrial settings because they overheated (no, they weren&#39;t doing anything critical so we just configured them to reboot every couple hours).I see something about a passive heat sink, I wonder if that&#39;s enough...&#34;,
 &#34;Does it still ship with minecraft installed? We had 2 of em full of bloat and gui tools, don&#39;t know exactly why&#34;,
 &#39;Revolution Pi is an open, modular and inexpensive industrial PC based on the well-known Raspberry Pi. Housed in a slim DIN-rail housing, the three available base modules can be seamlessly expanded by a variety of suitable I/O modules and fieldbus gateways. The 24V powered modules are connected via an overhead connector in seconds and can be easily configured via a graphical configuration tool.&#39;,
 &#34;I like the modular I/O.Partly off topic, but I&#39;ve imagined an ecosystem where Pi-like SBCs _only_ connect out via USB-C to a powered hub, and from there to physical I/O. Sort of a different take on North Bridge / South Bridge.&#34;,
 &#39;I don\x92t know anything about electronics, but I would like it if the replacement cost for home appliance control boards wasn\x92t $300. Making it a cheap interchangeable part would really cut down on waste.&#39;,
 &#34;I was hoping this would be price competitive with the BBB industrial. Alas, it&#39;s not (although it has substantially more raw computing power).&#34;,
 &#39;Looks cool for storing a home automation server in an electrical closet, although it would be pretty expensive at that price point&#39;,
 &#39;How is it different from Strato and ModBerry?&#39;,
 &#39;Raspberry Pi was all about the price, hence the success vs. Arduino. Checking the prices on site for these...and cheapest is above 100 Euro? Not a chance in hell.&#39;,
 &#39;Why is inability to download and install binaries from qt.io without login such of show stopper for people here?Other sites and organizations can compile and distribute the binaries.KDE Free Qt Foundation -The KDE Free Qt Foundation is an organization with the purpose of securing the availability of the Qt toolkit https://kde.org/community/whatiskde/kdefreeqtfoundation.php&#39;,
 &#39;A lot of noise for no reasons.You can not enforce login in for GPL / LGPL software distribution.Meaning this is just probably that the &#34;click/download&#34; link for the binary official SDK on the official website will require registration, nothing else.If it\&#39;s really the case, they should be clearer in their explanations.&#39;,
 &#39;&gt; Installation of Qt binaries will require a Qt AccountUh, what? I use programs like VLC and QbitTorrent which are built on Qt:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qt_(software)#Applications_usi...does that mean these require Qt registration by the end user?&#39;,
 &#34;I made a joke once that the Godot open-source game engine had &#39;accidentally&#39; become an amazing alternative to Qt (Godot&#39;s own editor is itself a Godot application and quite nice for a desktop UI).Notwithstanding what Qt offers in the embedded space, I think it&#39;s interesting to ask the question more seriously.  For rich, cross-platform desktop applications, is a game engine a better choice than Qt?&#34;,
 &#39;What a wonderful effort to prevent Qt popularity from growing.Read the title and thought &#34;perhaps this is time to explore more into Qt, beyond the classic Qt widgets...&#34;. Read the news - &#34;no, this seems more like time to forget about Qt altogether and explore the alternatives&#34;.&#39;,
 &#39;Hmm. Sad about needing to log in to download anything. Seems like prioritising marketing KPIs over developer experience.Anyway, not to be nitpicky or anything, but there is a typo on &#34;feedback we can get _form_ the community&#34; - otherwise I think it\&#39;s actually positive to offer point releases on a periodic basis.&#39;,
 &#34;I have not been affected but I heard some teams where a QT rep was interested to understand how they were using QT. Skip fast forward 2 years later, they now have to pay QT licenses while they where using the open source version before.It might have been a good business decision to get more support, or to use some non GPL components, but I can&#39;t help to think that the not so friendly push from the QT rep was also a reason...So I got the feeling this is just another step in that same direction.&#34;,

 &#39;Qt is quickly rising to Delphi levels of unaffordability.&#39;,
 &#34;Seeing people freak out over this, it&#39;s typical Qt Company: Really, really bad at communicating changes properly. Yes, it&#39;s annoying, but far from the big deal people make it out to be.&#34;,
 &#34;&gt;From February onward, everyone, including open-source Qt users, will require valid Qt accounts to download Qt binary packages.Hopefully this doesn&#39;t include redistributed binaries. I really do like KDE.&#34;,
 &#39;Can\&#39;t vouch for it, but there may be an alternative:&#34;CopperSpice is a set of individual libraries which can be used to develop cross platform software applications in C++. It is a totally open source project released under the LGPL V2.1 license and was initially derived from the Qt framework. Over the last several years CopperSpice has completely diverged, with a goal of providing a first class GUI library to unite the C++ community.&#34;https://www.copperspice.com&#39;,
 &#39;&#34;Installation of Qt binaries will require a Qt Account&#34;Farewell, Qt.&#39;,
 &#39;$499 for small companies and startups.QT is finally understanding their pricing was totally wrong.&#39;,
 &#34;&gt; From February onward, everyone, including open-source Qt users, will require valid Qt accounts to download Qt binary packages. We changed this because we think that a Qt account lets you make the best use of our services and contribute to Qt as an open-source user.It is quite annoying to get these thinly-veiled pseudo-reasons for forcing people to login to get the download. Surely they just want to know names and affiliations of who downloads their open source versions.That&#39;s understandable from a business perspective, but then please don&#39;t put some bullshit there about needing to register at download time to do code reviews and contribution.&#34;,
 &#39;I do find some of these changes annoying, but not particularly life-threatening. The use of a Qt account to download pre-built binaries by not being allowed to press skip will be annoying, but realistically speaking how often are you doing that? If you need them for CI, then you should (in my small world) be downloading once and hosting them yourself.With regards to LTS binaries, it is unfortunate, but we\x92ll still be able to grab sources from Git and (hopefully) their download site to rebuild patch versions from source.The other note that sticks out is the cheaper license for the Device Creation kit. This is for embedded systems, not general applications which I haven\x92t seen anyone mention.&#39;,
 &#34;My read of this is that you&#39;re free to continue to build and distribute your own binaries, but those won&#39;t be able to participate in the plugin ecosystem. The effect of this change depends on the value of the plugin service. I mean, it could be great. I certainly hope it&#39;s great for the Qt project.&#34;,
 &#39;Does there exist a CentOS equivalent of Qt?&#39;,
 &#39;I did feel something was afoot when a KDE developer blogged a warning shot about the terms of their agreement: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21755337&#39;,
 &#34;&gt; Installation of Qt binaries will require a Qt AccountI&#39;ve used Qt in professional environments with commercial licensing at previous gigs. I&#39;d considered using Qt for personal projects using their open source licensing. But this is a killer requirement. Goodbye, Qt.&#34;,
 &#34;Used Qt with Python a lot, 6 or 7 years ago. Their API&#39;s are really great. It&#39;s farewell I guess.&#34;,
 &#39;LTS and offline installer to become commercial-only&#34;All you freeloaders will become the test monkeys for our actual paying customers&#34; :)&#39;,
 &#34;What is an &#39;offering&#39;? Does it mean the licence agreement, or the product, or the pricing plan?I don&#39;t know this business terminology.&#34;,
 &#34;They&#39;ve just broke the existing support from Conan recipes.What a badass move&#34;,
 &#39;Removing QT from my current solution was obviously the right choice.&#39;,
 &#39;Is it legal to torrent. Not that i care about. Forget it. Bye Qt&#39;,
 &#34;With this move they will be considerably shrinking their developer base since a large, if not most, are enthusiasts of open source. Many frameworks made the same mistake in the past and now they&#39;re restricted to a small niche or have fallen into oblivion.&#34;,
 &#39;From the scattered information I have read, the infection has a very long dormant period (2 weeks), during which it may be contagious, and a high R_0 value of at least about 2.0. The R_0 value states how many people will catch the virus from an existing infected person.These two factors together are scary. I am extremely interested in seeing better data though.&#39;,
 &#39;&gt; All the viral genome sequences from affected individuals are very very close to each other. Several are identical and none has more than 5 differences (99.983% similarity). This strongly suggests that transmission into humans came from a single pointed source and happened very recently,  between Sep-Dec 2019.&gt; Given what we are learning from viral genome sequencing above, and given all the emergency measures being put in place in China in particular and around the world in general, there is every reason to believe that the epidemic will be controlled shortly.&#39;,
 &#39;I thought it was understood as courtesy to not name the epidemic after the city, which will forever become a blemish on local tourism?&#39;,
 &#39;I find genome sequences fascinating, life\&#39;s binary code has only 4 opcodes, a, c, g and t. I wonder if any computer VM will ever be able to actually fully run it. Still, the massively parallel capacity needed to run it &#34;realtime&#34; is not quite here just yet.&#39;,
 &#34;But what happens if the virus mutates? Wasn&#39;t this the case with the Spanish flu? The first wave, then the mutation from which causes the second wave. Could that potentially occur?&#34;,
 &#34;Article suggests the intermediary animal is unknown, but the early consensus seems to be that it&#39;s snakes.https://gizmodo.com/deadly-wuhan-virus-in-china-may-have-com...&#34;,
 &#39;Maybe vaccine can be made similar as those of Mers,SARS since the virus is closely related to those genetically.&#39;,
 &#39;this is probably the one thing going viral that silicon valley is not happy about&#39;,
 &#34;There is absolutely no way to 51% attack a major coin like Bitcoin for as little as $700k an hour. They are extrapolating from Nicehash&#39;s mining rental prices, but Nicehash doesn&#39;t have anything like the capacity you&#39;d need.You can see here[1] that nicehash has about 500 PH/s (500,000 TH/s) available for rent. However, Bitcoin&#39;s total hash rate right now is 100,000,000 TH/s[2]. This means that if you rented out the entire nicehash market, you&#39;d have 0.5% of the hash rate you need.Could you get the other 99.5% by buying lots of mining hardware? Theoretically yes, but realistically no. Bitmain is a major supplier of this kind of hardware, so let&#39;s use their prices as a reference. They&#39;re currently promoting a 67 TH/s unit for $1585 [3]. You would need more than 1.4 million of these units, at a cost of over $2.2 billion dollars. Not that any supplier can fill an order like that quickly.And we haven&#39;t even gotten to the power and operations costs. You&#39;d need dozens of huge data centers to run all this hardware, each one consuming astronomical amounts of electricity. You&#39;d probably pick your data center locations based on availability of cheap power and labor, and you&#39;d become a major commercial presence in each of those towns. The local papers would have photos of you shaking hands with the mayor as your data centers open up. Everyone would know what you&#39;re doing, including the FBI.[1] https://www.nicehash.com/my/marketplace/SHA256\n[2] https://www.blockchain.com/en/charts/hash-rate\n[3] https://shop.bitmain.com/product/detail?pid=0002020011715132...&#34;,
 &#34;Computational power is not a good proof of anything. It devours energy and disproportionately rewards weird market actors (like people with custom mines ASICs).I always wondered whether storage could be used as proof of stake. It might use less energy and it probably will have much better effect on the IT industry as a whole. First, mining ASICs are not general computational devices and cannot be used for anything useful. On the other hand, storage is storage and can be repurposed. Second, it will up the prices for storage hardware, but that is probably a good thing in the long run. (Consider how super-cheap storage enabled unlimited surveillance and software bloat, for example.)I don&#39;t know whether access to storage can solve all the problems a blockchain solves, but it can solve some. Like proving that you&#39;re a real actor in the system, rather than a temporary fake.Some random ideas I had about how this could work:If you want to transact with someone, they send you a challenge that consists of a set of addresses in a large file. You must respond with a hash of data at those addresses, problematically proving that you have the entire file.This is the foundation. There are obvious challenges to how useful this is. Many of them are solvable.&#34;,
 &#34;If you&#39;re capable of playing a long con, it costs much less than the stated dollar prices.With Bitcoin, for example, a smart malicious actor could infiltrate the Core development team and through their social capital make certain malicious pull requests get merged. This way, if the chain ever splits (let&#39;s say, due to a bug you planted), you can actually also influence miners to hop onto a minor chain without you ever owning any hashing power!To see how this is done, look at the 2013 Bitcoin fork and see how a couple developers steered large miners away from the majority chain: https://freedom-to-tinker.com/2015/07/28/analyzing-the-2013-...The only counter-argument to this is how code reviews should catch this, but history has clearly shown that bugs (including supply-inflation-causing ones) make it into cryptocurrencies all the time: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposu...Hash Rate is security theatre.&#34;,
 &#34;By definition, to execute a 51% attack on Bitcoin, you would need to buy computing power greater than 100% of the entire network&#39;s current computing power. In other words, you would single-handedly double the global demand for computing power in this market.Is there enough supply readily available to satisfy a doubling of global demand?  How much would it cost to bring such computing power online?  How quickly could it be done?  Wouldn&#39;t the price of computing power skyrocket?EDIT: Meekro&#39;s comment elsewhere on this page makes essentially the same point in a more concrete manner: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22161500 -- I think his comment is better; read it. Also, see bencxr&#39;s analogy with trying to control 51% of global oil supply: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22161575&#34;,
 &#34;1) If a big crypto-community notices an attack, the cost of a 51% attack would rise2) There are mechanisms to offer smaller cryptocurrencies Bitcoin level security, like Komodo&#39;s Delayed Proof of Work (https://komodoplatform.com/security-delayed-proof-of-work-dp...)&#34;,
 &#39;Can someone ELI5 how these numbers fit together? It costs me  $3/hr to 51% DeepOnion, which has a market cap of $1.95M. In practical terms, what does that mean?&#39;,
 &#39;It feels surprisingly cheap.Take bitcoin, a 105Billion cap can be subverted for just 700K per hour?Not to mention DeepOnion for 3 bucks an hour. I can see people do that just for lulz.&#39;,
 &#34;These numbers are based off the current price of hashrate. As soon as you try to buy significant amounts for larger currencies like Bitcoin, the numbers skyrocket.The nice-hashable column on the site shows how much hash power is available for purchase.To read the page naively would be a little like claiming one could hoard 51% of the oil supply given today&#39;s price at the pump. In reality, as soon as you started buying in large quantities, the price would skyrocket (making that attack very much more costly), suppliers would cut you off, and others would notice.&#34;,
 &#34;I pointed this out elsewhere in this comment thread, but resurfacing here since it&#39;s perhaps not as clear as it should be: The attack cost is based on the the extrapolated cost of attacking the given coin based on the current hashing price on nicehash. If Another caveat: It&#39;s potentially cheaper to attack these coins than the number shown on this site since you receive block rewards from the time period when you attack a coin. In a lot of cases this will recover a majority of the money you spend on the attack. That said, this isn&#39;t guaranteed, and you are forced to put up this amount of money in order to carry out the attack.Disclaimer: I built crypto51 ~a year ago&#34;,
 &#39;Since it took a while for me to understand this. A 51% attack doesn\x92t let you steal money from anyone. It essentially lets you block all transactions from making it to the blockchain. Nodes will still verify all transactions and ignore transactions that are invalid.Edit: you can also create multiple forks and switch between them. External viewers will see both forks and if they don\x92t or can\x92t handle the difference they could experience a double spend.That being said any miner has the ability to sort transaction any way they want which can give them an advantage. So if someone has a lot of hashing power they can use that ability to delay certain transactions or to give preference to others.&#39;,
 &#34;As I recall, last time this was posted, Monero was still on this list. Now it is not. Did the new PoW algorithm for Monero essentially remove the &#39;rentable hashing power&#39; available?&#34;,
 &#39;Anyone know how to calculate the revenue side of these attacks? E.g. if it costs 700k to attack the bitcoin network for 1 hour, how much money could you make in that hour (say based on average transaction volumes)?&#39;,
 &#39;$705k per hour for Bitcoin - these numbers sound very expensive.Do they take into account that during an attack the attacker will earn block rewards and transaction fees?Because if not, then they vastly overestimate the costs.This sounds like it is based on the some energy price that would be needed to do 51% of Bitcoins hashing.Doing so could very well be profitable.The reason it would be hard to do is that the attacker would have to gather a ton of hardware that way way exceeds the energy costs.&#39;,
 &#39;Hard to take this seriously when it is missing Garlicoin.&#39;,
 &#34;QuarkChain QKC $6.01 M Ethash 10 GH/s $7 69,816%So 7$ is the nicehash cost? But isn&#39;t nicehash an out of the box solution? So if I wanted to actually execute a 51% attack I&#39;d have to deploy my own malicious mining software to the nodes, that then issued an invalid transaction and forced consensus on it ... is that the idea? Can someone who knows a little bit more about this fill me in?&#34;,
 &#39;Also relevant, one the front page of HN today: Bitcoin Gold hit by 51% attacks, $72K in cryptocurrency double-spenthttps://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2020/01/27/bitcoin-gold-51-p...&#39;,
 &#39;Interesting article on this topic:https://blog.coinbase.com/how-coinbase-views-proof-of-work-s...Also, Ethereum is transitioning to proof of stake which will make attacks much more expensive because an attacker must acquire large amounts of ETH for each attack.&#39;,

 &#39;seems like any nation state can easily afford to do this. we should be wary of any country that is heavily reliant on exports of ink and paper.&#39;,
 &#39;I feel like if someone can envision a motive attractive enough we have to assume that China has the plans in place to execute such an attack.&#39;,

 &#34;This whole thing reads like an ad for one particular product.  Given that the product isn&#39;t specific to citrus fruit trees, I&#39;m not sure what relevance it has.&#34;,

 &#39;Same, but different, for New Orleans which already below sea level is sinking a few inches a year. [0] Saving New Orleans and the surrounding coastal areas starts with the soil too.

 &#39;I studied engineering/physics and I\&#39;ve dipped into the agricultural field the past year having developed an interest in it, also observing the operations of a local organic farm.It\&#39;s actually quite fascinating. I\&#39;m currently following a course created by Dr. Elaine Ingham, who is a microbiologist that studies soil biology and has done some really amazing research. She also worked at Colorado State University, which can\&#39;t be a coincidence!Here\&#39;s the lowdown of what happens, because we\&#39;ve been getting this wrong for centuries in agriculture. The nutrients (N, Ph, Mg, K, etc) are bound to materials in the soil ranging from rocks to pebbles, to sands, silts and clays. We have been destroying the soil by tilling practices and large machinery which are creating compaction layers that lead to anaerobic conditions causing the &#34;good&#34; biology in the soil to die and also preventing roots from growing to the depth they need. It turns out that the way that the nutrients become available to the roots of the plant is by means of the bacteria/fungi breaking their bonds from the previously mentioned materials (rocks, etc) and then, even more interestingly, they get eaten by higher trophic level predators who shit out the nutrients in plant available form!Some fun facts:\n- The roots release sugars (photosynthates) into the soil which attract particular bacteria/fungi based off its needs for nutrients AND pH requirements (bacteria release substances which raise pH and fungi acids which lower it, and the pH can vary on the scale of micrometers based off this)-Bacteria and particularly fungi (if you haven\&#39;t studied fungi, go watch Paul Stamets on Joe Rogan, cause they\&#39;re incredible organisms https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPqWstVnRjQ) create symbiotic relationships with the plant, each one feeding and protecting the other.- Many tests which tell you your soil is low in nutrients can be complete bullshit. Extracting agents will yield different results, and if, for example, you\&#39;re only looking at soluble nutrients, you\&#39;re missing the fact that they\&#39;re available but just bound up chemically and require the biological activity.- dousing your soil w/ inorganic fertilizers are hardly short-term solutions because 1) if the soil has no structure to it, then they will wash immediately out with rain and 2) you\&#39;re literally dissolving salts into the water of the soil, making the water unavailable to the plant and can stress the plants more. Sure, they might get a quick dose of nutrients but you\&#39;re playing a losing game.- there\&#39;s a whole bunch of other stuff. Elaine\&#39;s course available on www.SoilFoodWeb.com, it\&#39;s a bit expensive, but I find it fascinating and I\&#39;m barely halfway past Ch 2. She basically gives you all the science behind it and the know-how of how to address the problem yourself, not rely on a product. She\&#39;s a total G, it\&#39;s really fun listening to her and hearing about the history of her research. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elaine_InghamI\&#39;m not sure what this Rhizolizer brand is, but I presume it\&#39;s not far off from a &#34;tea&#34; made from vermicomposting (i.e., you feed your compost to worms and they shit out a magical biologically rich and diverse &#34;casting&#34; which you can utilize to put the healthy biology back in your soil)&#39;,
 &#39;This seems like an ad/sponsored article, not an actual report&#39;,
 &#39;&gt;I\&#39;m guessing below 5%, but I think this level of preparedness would be a good goal for most people who can afford it.I never understood this attitude (very common in the US popular culture for one), or the same idea about stocking food, utilities, ammo and such, and taking of to some kind of bunker for emergency scenarios (from a storm, to &#34;when the government comes&#34;, to the zombie apocalypse or similar).While it\&#39;s prudent to be prepared as a family, it\&#39;s even more prudent (and it\&#39;s always missing even as a though from such descriptions, posts, etc) to push and make sure your country/city/community is prepared.It\&#39;s the complacent &#34;everyman for themselves&#34; mentality I don\&#39;t understand.And with such a mindset, most of these &#34;everyman for themselves&#34; won\&#39;t last a day. They\&#39;d have their stuff stolen, or even be killed, by people with more guns and larger teams. That you have guns yourself wont matter much, they\&#39;ll have more, or smoke you out, or kill you from afar when you\&#39;re not aware they\&#39;re even watching you, or any other such technique.If the prevalent idea for making it safe, is going at it alone (as a single person or family unit), then others will be all for themselves too, and if they can get ahead by screwing you, they will. Harder for them to do so when a community works together and shares their preparations.&#39;,
 &#39;I don\&#39;t know. It seems to me like we keep getting better at making the system more resilient. Disasters seem to be less problematic now than when I was a child. Even regional disasters get aid brought in on a scale that simply wasn\&#39;t possible when I was a child.As an adult, I\&#39;ve witnessed disasters routinely get remedied quicker, better etc than predicted. And we are incredibly meh about it.Y2K was supposed to be a global financial disaster. It gets remembered like &#34;Ha! Can you imagine those dummies stocked their basements with 5 years of flour like this was supposed to be a disaster?!&#34;When Iraq set Kuwaiti oil wells on fire, it was predicted that they would burn for years and be a global environmental disaster. Instead, crack teams from around the world converged on the country and invented new techniques to resolve it. They were all out in six months, with essentially no fanfare for this miracle.Afterwards, the desert bloomed from the combination of fertilizer (soot from the fires) and water (from putting them out) like no one had seen in twenty years. That was also given no fanfare.I\&#39;m in no position to do disaster prep. My life is an ongoing disaster and crisis management is all I can arrange for myself currently. But I also mostly just don\&#39;t really see unmitigated disasters in the news of the sort that were the norm in my childhood.Instead, I often see &#34;Disaster In The News! Prediction: 200k Will Die!!!&#34; Follow up: &#34;200 people died. Meh. On to more exciting News.&#34;&#39;,
 &#39;Very good link. I think a lot of people get intimidated by the idea of emergency preparedness because it feels like such a big, overwhelming thing to deal with. One cause of this is perhaps the Hollywood/media image of &#34;disaster&#34; as a singular extreme event that obliterates the average person except for a few plucky heroes. In contrast, there\&#39;s a full spectrum of severity, and any small amount of preparedness can help.In case anyone here hasn\&#39;t seen it before, I\&#39;d like to share the article &#34;Doomsday planning for less crazy folk&#34; [0]. It\&#39;s a good, sober-headed step-by-step guide to evaluating one\&#39;s own threat model and making actionable steps toward improving one\&#39;s emergency preparedness -- both small-scale and large-scale. I have a routine to-do item to re-read one section of this article every few weeks and think of ways I can make myself more resilient.[0] http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/prep/&#39;,
 &#34;There is relatively compact pamphlet by the German government on disaster preparedness that is aimed at ordinary people with no prepper ambitions and mostly limits itself to practical advice like a minimal food stockpile and stocking up on candles. It doesn&#39;t try to shame the reader into becoming a whole different (much more paranoid, completely no-fun) person, which is a nice change from the usual prepper reading lists. Some parts only apply to Germany (e.g. how to call for help in an emergency), but most of it should be relatively widely applicable. They refresh it periodically, the current revision from fall 2018 is vailable in German[1] and in an English translation[2] that seems to capture the extremely arid dryness of German government language even better than the German version, but is still quite readable.[1] https://www.bbk.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/BBK/DE/Publikat...[2] https://www.bbk.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/BBK/DE/Publikat...&#34;,
 &#39;Something I learned while living in Tokyo is that the two major risks here are not the disasters themselves, but the &#34;side effects&#34; of those:- Earthquakes, yes some houses fall down and people die, but in general the bigger risks is the fires that spread from broken gas pipes and broken water pipes. Oh, and tsunamis.- Typhoons, some people die from a direct hit from flying debris, but it\&#39;s normally the floods and earth slides that are the issue and kill most people.I\&#39;m from a quiet calm part of the Mediterranean so I\&#39;m not used to this at all. Many of the cities around there even moved the rivers away from the cities to avoid floods in heavy rains.As for prep, I can live 1 week easily in my home (lots of water, enough food). Which I hope not, but might need those if the coronavirus hits Tokyo as strongly as China. And I\&#39;m thinking of buying some more just in case since some companies are sending their workers to work from home for 2 weeks.&#39;,
 &#34;My big beef with disaster prepping is the rabbit hole aspect of it. The prepper community is nuts, but also remarkably intelligent. Perfectly good articles like this one are going to keep convincing me that I&#39;m not doing enough.Ignorance truly is bliss.&#34;,
 &#39;&gt; Why don\&#39;t people plan for potential disasters? [...] even people who do have more time and money also haven\&#39;t generally thought through simpler preparations.I can\&#39;t speak for everyone, but despite having money and discretionary time, my list of priorities has an event horizon entry called &#34;relax and recharge ready for tomorrow&#34; and very few things below that make much progress.Should I plan for potential disasters? Sure, it\&#39;s on my list of priorities, just after \&#39;do a proper cut to increase my abs definition\&#39; and \&#39;get to know my neighbours well\&#39; and just before \&#39;finish that online Spanish course I started\&#39; and \&#39;write down the serial numbers of all my electronic gadgets\&#39;(Of course, I live in the UK. So to me it seems extremely unlikely I\&#39;d ever face the kind of disaster where I\&#39;d, for example, need 15 litres of drinking water.)&#39;,
 &#39;Why don\&#39;t people plan for potential disasters?It\&#39;s not a high enough priority for them. People might occasionally think about low likelihood, high impact events. But they rarely make a detailed plan for how to reduce the risk.&#34;Risk management&#34; is not just for projects and organizations. If you\&#39;re a parent you probably do risk assessments (https://teamsuccess.io/risk) every day, without realizing it. And ultimately, just like managers, you too as a parent, are ultimately responsible for managing risks. :)&#39;,
 &#34;Bona fides first, then my posture on this issue. So, first, here&#39;s the major disasters I&#39;ve been through:* I was on a ship in 1999 that lost all engines in the middle of the Pacific. Waited 2 days hot and quiet in the sun waiting for repair parts to be airdropped.* 9/11 (and the response thereto)* Hurricane Katrina (bought a house in New Orleans 5 weeks before, evacuated; let people we still have never met live in our house because we couldn&#39;t go back for a year. They stole nothing.) Went back shortly after, SMS worked.* Hurricane Rita (no direct impact, but ran a packed-to-gills special needs shelter as a first year medical student -- mainly because ex-military and had accidentally evacuated from Katrina into Rita&#39;s path). Ran the shelter with 184 patients, 30 other medical students on shifts, a secretary, and an Open Office spreadsheet. The network worked, but the county&#39;s emergency shelter patient tracking software could only do input, no output. And it was to be sent to a central database, but they had never plugged in an ethernet cable, so I guess all the data went to /dev/null. Didn&#39;t matter, couldn&#39;t read it. When I left, I wiped their system and moved the patient database (i.e. spreadsheet) to their brand new Ubuntu desktop.* Hurricane Isabel (flooded our basement, lost power for about 48 hours - sump pump no good if no power. Oh ... someone had stolen our generator. Keep those things locked up).* The 2007 Witch Creek fire (San Diego) burned the house directly behind ours.* 2011 Southwest blackout in San Diego. In the middle of the blackout I was still able to send an editorial project back to client in Tokyo.* Fukushima Daichi. Volunteered to deploy for Operation Tomodachi because my brother lived between the reactors and Tokyo. They were happy to send me. Aftershocks for over a month.* The 2014 Bernardo fire. I watched this one from the Canyon rim before fire fighters arrived, fire planes so low they were below me. Nothing between the fire line and my house except fuel and favorable winds.* Typhoon Mangkhut (lost power for about 4 days, lots of trees down)We currently own a generator and we keep some extra bottled water and batteries on hand. We have UPS units on the router/modem cluster and a couple others around the house (network usually survives power outages, if you can connect). I have stabilized gas for the generator. Regularly check the generator. A couple of hand crank radios just in case. We probably round up a bit on paper towels and canned goods and dry pasta. We have two propane tanks for the grill (power outage = time to grill all the meat in the freezer).Basically, even on a third world island in the middle of the Pacific with the worst storm in a generation, we didn&#39;t run out of fresh water or food, and nerves were much calmed by the readily available network. I have universally found network to be more reliable than power.Could something worse happen? That never occurred to me (like the worst interpretation what (1) could have been). If it&#39;s markedly worse than what I&#39;ve had to deal with so far, evacuation is generally the best viable option. If the situation is so bad that evac is not an option, my experience is that you&#39;re just going to have to deal with it. And, as it turns out, humans are reasonably good at not dying.(1) https://www.kuam.com/story/41500001/initially-thought-to-be-...&#34;,

 &#39;The flipside of this is: how effective is preparing actually going to be? If you look at what most preppers are doing, not very.As an avid hiker and rock climber, when I watch a lot of prepper videos on YouTube, I find a lot of laughable ideas.* About 50% of the preppers I see have seemingly no concern for cross-contamination of their water system, and no anti-diarrheals in their med kits to deal with the giardia they aren\&#39;t preventing.* Paracord is popular among preppers, but it\&#39;s pretty unclear why. I\&#39;ve literally never seen a prepper demonstrate hanging a bear bag, which is literally the only reason I\&#39;ve ever used paracord in the wild. Lashing together structures boy-scout-style requires a lot more cord than they are carrying, and having hiked a few thousand miles in my hiking career, I don\&#39;t think I\&#39;ve ever felt that lashing together a structure was necessary or even worth the effort, despite that being a skill I\&#39;m proficient at. The fanciest paracords out there have metal wire (for electricity) and fishing line inside the paracord--maybe it\&#39;s just me, but I would rather just carry the fishing line separately, and I can\&#39;t imagine a situation where I have access to electricity and not wire. It\&#39;s also unclear to me whether any of these preppers actually have any skills as electricians.* Knives: the number one item I find left behind on trails are these giant Bowie knives. People buy them at an army surplus or sporting goods store, and then a few miles onto the trail they realize their pack is really heavy, and the item that stands out as the most weight with the least usefulness is the 3 pound knife. I carry a CRKT NIAD[1] when rock climbing, and a Snow Peak knife (part of a cutlery set--I think an older version of this[2]). What these knives have in common is that they are extremely light. But what do preppers have? In some cases, the Bowie knives aren\&#39;t even close to the largest things.* Guns: while preppers seem unconcerned with the weight of their knives, when it comes to guns, weight suddenly seems to be a concern. To achieve low weight, it seems most preppers are willing to settle for the idea that they\&#39;re never going to hunt for, or defend themselves from, anything larger than a jackrabbit. Almost all the popular &#34;prepper guns&#34;, i.e. this Henry AR7[3] are in caliber .22LR, which beyond being a tiny round, has reliability issues. Of course, there are also preppers who go to the other extreme[4]; if you\&#39;ve got your 9mm handgun, .22LR rifle, 12 gauge shotgun, .308 bolt action, and .223 AR15, I hope you\&#39;re in your gun bunker when the apocalypse happens, because you\&#39;re not moving anywhere with a quarter of of a ton of firearms and ammo. Personally, I think fishing would be far more consistent for food, and I don\&#39;t have the stomach for violence even in self-defense (maybe once, but on a consistent basis?) so I\&#39;d probably rather use the weight for carrying a light fishing kit and more food.I don\&#39;t mean all of this to come across as super harsh on the prepper community. If you enjoy collecting this stuff, do it. I\&#39;m not criticizing what anyone does for fun, and it\&#39;s pretty unlikely that you\&#39;ll ever have to rely on this stuff, so there\&#39;s no real harm. I\&#39;m just saying that if my experience in the outdoors is any indication, a lot of attempts to prepare for life that doesn\&#39;t rely on civilization are pretty ineffective.[1] https://www.crkt.com/niad.html[2] https://snowpeak.com/collections/cutlery/products/titanium-f...[3] https://www.henryusa.com/rifles/u-s-survival-ar-7/[4] https://prepperswill.com/5-guns-every-prepper-should-own/&#39;,

 &#39;I understand the idea that a stolen property have to be returned to its owner, but on the other hand I would suggest a third possibility. Maybe UK should be allowed to buy legally the objects instead to return them [1].For a country with more than 200000 british-nigerian citizens paying due respect to Nigerian culture and history would send the right message to the population, protect all UK children against blatant racism and ignorance, and act as ambassadors of Nigeria in Occcident, a country with more people than Japan or Russia.I would smile about the idea of the future 15Yo Sade, Seal or John Boyega being allowed exposure to something that is also part of their legacy in a free &#34;Museum of Nigeria and Nigerian people&#34; and develop a sense of pride about it.[1] (Or maybe they could just scan the objects, made exact bronze replicas and spread them for countries with extensive nigerian population for the public benefit. That would end the dispute)&#39;,

This way the decompiler could be used for both dex and ordinary java jars.I think dex translates to jar in a straightforward way, because dex is being compiled from compiled java classes.But nonetheless, the more reverse engineering tools, the merrier (but I wouldn&#39;t run this EXE file outside a disposable virtual machine).&#34;,

 &#39;IMHO the carefulness that was put in writing that message make it impossible to interpret it as antisemitic or bad faith. Actually interpreting it as antisemitic is bad faith.&#39;,
 &#34;Headline is misleading. He didn&#39;t &#39;offer to speak&#39;, he proposed splitting the conference 50:50 between Israel and Palestine. Fine, if that&#39;s something you think would benefit the community, but then should we also be splitting conferences in China between Beijing and Tibet? Russia and East Ukraine? India and Kashmir?Either turn every academic conference into a geopolitical soapbox or just host it where the engineers are and leave it at that.&#34;,
 &#39;Why the censorship though? That is pretty nefarious.Palestinians basically live in israel, but have manufactured concrete borders put around them. Inhibiting their freedom of movement in their own country. Not allowing them to go to conferences. So holding a deb community member asking the community if they would be willing to spend some time for the engineers less fortunate, is actually quite awesome of him.&#39;,
 &#39;&gt; Can you see any way in which this message could be considered anti-semitic?I accept the message can be disturbing to some (not to me) but I believe it is not anti-semitic.&#39;,
 &#39;Surprise someone flagged something mentioning censorship talking about Israel.&#39;,
 &#39;So called &#34;hate speech&#34; is actually about censoring speech that &#34;they&#34; &#34;hate&#34;. Free speech or death.&#39;,
 &#39;the fact this whole thread is [flagged] without justification tells me we need to share the link more widelyAs the story goes,\n  First they came...&#39;,

 &#39;Anyone here think organising a 2nd conference is not incredibly hard?It probably would push the conference into a large loss even if they could get it organised.One speaker only offering to speak twice, which is basically nothing, is very bad faith.The email should be deleted. They are a troll.The website linked is definitely a troll website.&#39;,
 &#39;Obvious troll is obvious. Consider the fact that the owner of the website is the author of the message. Perhaps the message was never sent at all? The message itself is also flamebait bound to generate a lot of useless discussion, not to mention it is really counterproductive and the idea proposed is unfeasible in practice; what\&#39;s more, it furthers the idea of apartheid: &#34;let\&#39;s make two debcons: one for first class people, one for others&#34;. The author is a bad faith actor.&#39;,
 &#39;He removed a bad-faith message that needlessly brought up political issues. Good for him. One of the reasons I avoid many of these communities is the hateful, bad-faith political posturing. (One of my 4 grandparents was born in Gaza City, and expelled in 1929 [1], so I believe I have a right to an opinion on this.)You wonder if there would have been a problem if he had said simply, free of political prodding, &#34;I plan to give the same talk again in Ramallah. Is anyone interested in attending?&#34;[1] https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/history-of-jewish-settl...Edit: So Hacker News are downvoting an actual descendant of a Gazan refugee for having a polite opinion on this?

 &#39;Many people remain uncomfortable about how DebConf organizers are handling the challenges presented in the middle east.As someone, who has zero experience with DebConf whatsoever, I have to say, I can see how such an intro could be interpreted as anti-semitic.

If it\&#39;s just because it is Israeli then do all Israeli conferences need to &#34;handle&#34; this challenge?Should DebCon be boycotted if it doesn\&#39;t live up to said &#34;challenges&#34;?But maybe someone can explain, what is meant by &#34;challenges&#34;?Also, as a sidenote, the article doesn\&#39;t help it\&#39;s case either, if it uses the Holocaust as a reason to criticize Israel.&#39;,
 &#39;I think that\&#39;s a really bad article.\nIt\&#39;s (as always) not that simple.He says &#34;if you want to build a really fast program, pay attention to the performance from the start.&#34;. So it\&#39;s a business requirement from the start (to build a really fast program). That\&#39;s fine and should be taken into account for development. Put it in your definition of done, start with performance and regression tests or something like that to pay attention to this particular business requirement. Have checks for your performance requirements and handle them as any other requirement for your software.But most projects simply don\&#39;t have that requirement and that\&#39;s fine. Sure, your project will fail if it\&#39;s unusable and slow but it will also fail if you put your efforts into unneeded optimizations from the start and slow down development of other features. I\&#39;ve seen projects fail due to premature optimizations in the beginning.&#39;,
 &#34;I work on systems where speed is a requirement, and this think-about-speed-from-the-beginning is the way to proper way to do this.I&#39;ve also been parachuted into projects that are having performance problems, and usually you can find some nice low hanging fruit.  But there&#39;s usually some crucial poor-performing part that can&#39;t be made faster without a complete rewrite that uses a entirely different algorithm and data-structure.  And then it becomes clear that doing so would impact all the other code; basically, its unfixable because of early design choices.Most of the slowest programs I&#39;ve had to crawl into have been &#39;designed for web scale&#39; nonsense from the beginning, and die a horrid performance death through premature distribution and the use of &#39;scalable&#39; nosql technologies that were much talked about when the project adopted them but now are rather out of fashion, thankfully.  My experience is that ipc is bad for performance and having a system on as few boxes as possible is good for performance, which seems to be quite the opposite to the system architectures that were all the &#39;web scale&#39; rage this past decade.&#34;,
 &#39;&gt; Programmers waste enormous amounts of time thinking about, or worrying about, the speed of noncritical parts of their programs, and these attempts at efficiency actually have a strong negative impact when debugging and maintenance are considered. We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: premature optimization is the root of all evil. Yet we should not pass up our opportunities in that critical 3%.Knuth, &#34;Structured Programming with Goto Statements&#34;. Computing Surveys 6:4 (December 1974), pp. 261\x96301, §1. doi:10.1145/356635.356640No one has said to ignore optimization, what the quote is actually telling us is to avoid falling into the trap of micro-optimizations which don\&#39;t really affect the overall performance of the system.  Yes, you can spend a week making the world\&#39;s fastest substring-in-string function, but if you\&#39;re only checking that your email address has an @ in it, that\&#39;s kinda silly.Make your programs fast by concentrating on the areas which give you the most bang for the buck and avoid falling into rat holes where you optimize something which has no impact on the system overall.&#39;,
 &#39;&gt; VS Code / Atom eventually became faster versions of their original Electron prototypes. And I\x92m not saying it\x92s impossible to speed up programs after release. I\x92m saying these improvements are accidental. It\x92s sheer luck they happened.This is... completely wrong? Those projects have invested considerable work into making them fast.He does have a point though: there is a path-dependence when developing software, and some of the fundamental choices have an influence on the performance, and they cannot be easily reversed later, when it is time to make things fast. Things like:- language (JS vs Rust)- framework (Electron vs Native)- architecture&#39;,
 &#39;In my opinion, the truth is somewhere between what the author is suggesting and what most developers actually do. I recently came across The Fallacy of Premature Optimization on ACM [1], which I think is a much better take on this topic. It clarifies the statement that started this confusion which, in whole, was &#34;We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: premature optimization is the root of all evil&#34; [2].The key words being &#34;small efficiencies&#34;, but you seldom hear that part of the quote.[1] https://ubiquity.acm.org/article.cfm?id=1513451\n[2] Sir Charles Antony Richard Hoare&#39;,
 &#39;Uh, sort of. That quote can be abused of course, but it is still correct.Actually, this article abuses it -- it\&#39;s confusing performance and optimizations.If you want performance, you design for it. When you optimize you profile and modify an existing system to improve something (usually speed, but could be other things like memory or requests, or whatever else might be constrained).I think the article makes a decent point about performance, but just shouldn\&#39;t confuse it with optimizations.The right time to address the performance potential of your app or system is at design time. That\&#39;s when you\&#39;re going to be able to reduce the overall amount of work your system needs to do its job, and design for contingencies in case this or that box or line turns into a bottleneck.Now, it is best to do high-level design of your essential components early -- you\&#39;ll not only be able ensure your system has the performance potential it needs, but other things as well, e.g., to minimize the the overall amount of code you need to write, to make your system more maintainable, etc. So I agree with the general point of the article -- &#34;performance first&#34; but it shouldn\&#39;t really get mired in confusion over optimizations.Rather than &#34;performance first&#34; I\&#39;d say &#34;do high-level design early, and don\&#39;t forget to design for your performance goals&#34;.&#39;,
 &#39;Similarly, as Jeff Atwood put it: &#34;performance is a feature&#34;https://blog.codinghorror.com/performance-is-a-feature/&#39;,
 &#39;So the story should better have been: Develop a sane architecture which is fast by design but do low-level performance optimizations at the end&#39;,
 &#39;performance first? accessibility first? mobile first? security first? correctness first? ...There can only one thing come first, that\&#39;s the definition of the word &#34;first&#34;. You know what I do? &#34;refactorizable first&#34;. Keep your code in a state that refactoring things is relatively safe and then you can work on the problems when they appear.&#39;,
 &#39;I think there are bits of false dichotomy in here. Writing optimised code from the get go and thinking about it at a later stage are not your only two options.You can always think about performance implications of your implementation and keep them in mind. This is typically the runtime, your infrastructure, your chosen level of abstraction etc. You know your implementation is not the fastest, but you know what your limits are and where the low hanging fruit is.To make it more specific - I implemented some economic model thingy and all I wanted was for it to compile and run correctly, so I wrote it in a way that I could swap the data storage for concurrency-safe structures without impacting the results - but since that added tons of complexity, I just designed it with a pluggable storage in mind. Then I developed it as a single-threaded program and wrote tons of tests. Once that and the external API were done and validated, I plugged in the concurrent storage layer and enjoyed great speedups.So no, my first prototype was not performant at all and I was okay with that.&#39;,
 &#39;I think of performance in a different way: &#34;don\&#39;t do stupid things&#34; is my mantra. In other words, while not focusing on performance right away, I avoid doing stupid things. This lets me produce software which runs surprisingly well, spending very little time on improving performance.&#39;,
 &#34;All the performance in the world doesn&#39;t matter if your software doesn&#39;t work, doesn&#39;t do useful things or isn&#39;t complete.Plenty of good, useful software that is well used is kind of slow. I don&#39;t know anyone using anything that&#39;s very fast but incorrect or unfinished software.&#34;,
 &#39;This article makes a strange assumption. That you know perfectly the end result before starting the process, which is a rare case in my experience.Normally, a product will start with a small feature, and all sorts of random stuff will be added to it to make it grow. Some of them will be abandoned, as they\&#39;ll fail commercially, and some will expand as they bring money or attention. Creating an architecture that can allow that kind of expansion without crumbling over tech debt is the challenge.Ultimately, some programs can be reduced to a simple operation, and that can be designed from the ground up to be really performant. Something like the silver searcher (https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher)  or ripgrep (https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) have the advantage that they have laser-focus in what they want, and designed to take advantage of that. Most of the developed software have way broader objectives.The important part of &#34;premature optimisation is the root of all evil&#34; is PREMATURE. Don\&#39;t optimise things that is still uncertain that required to be optimised. When performance is critical OF COURSE optimisation is a requirement.&#39;,
 &#39;There might be some confusion of terminology at work here.\nI tend to agree with the article that you have to think about performance while designing your program, but that is not a contradiction to what Knuth is saying.Knuth talks about optimization, which is a trade-off to make your existing code faster by sacrificing readability.This guy talks about proper design, which is a trade-off between time to market and quality.You can (and should!) have both. Think about what you do before you do it, and then optimize the parts that need more work.BTW: I think there might also be a misunderstanding about why optimization can be bad. djb used to say &#34;profile, don\&#39;t speculate&#34;. I think this is the core of the Knuth recommendation as well.If you optimize before you have written all the code, chances are you don\&#39;t even fully understand the problem the code is trying to solve yet, so you might have to rewrite parts of it, and then it would suck if you had sunk a few months into optimizing those parts.Also, only after you have all the code and you have test cases do you have an opportunity to profile and find out which parts of your code are contributing the most to its lack of performance. The fundamental insight here is called Amdahl\&#39;s Law. Or maybe you find out that your code is already fast enough.I usually spend a ton of time beforehand thinking about how to write code that will not need much optimization later, but sometimes you find out your initial assumptions were wrong.&#39;,
 &#39;Performance is largely architectural for most types of software. The extreme difficulty of redesigning architecture after the software is feature complete (it approximates a rewrite) makes it a requirement that any performance and efficiency considerations be designed into the system from day one. Optimizations you can add later are always severely constrained by the kinds of optimizations the architecture allows. In most software I see, the &#34;performance later&#34; designs tacitly remove most possibility of macro-optimization.Not all software needs to care about performance, but I also see a lot of large multi-server monstrosities that could easily be run simply and cleanly on a single server with capacity to spare if more thought had been put into performance and efficiency.&#39;,
 &#39;It seems many comments in this thread don\&#39;t get the point.The &#34;Premature Optimization is Root of all Evil&#34; is about juvenile low level optimizations that sacrifice code readability. They don\&#39;t give high perf gains either.But that doesn\&#39;t mean &#34;Don\&#39;t think at all about performance in beginning, you can optimize later&#34;. That\&#39;s bullshit notion. Someone will end up paying in AWS bills for that. For instance, every programmer should know how latency varies between disk and memory access, and think about the tradeoffs at design/spec level.It is true that there are cases where even that doesn\&#39;t matter. But in most cases where people think so, It ends up they pay double in AWS bills to save two hours of thinking.&#39;,
 &#39;As a tangent to this, the widespread lack of performance/efficiency-first thinking in software design is responsible for an enormous amount of waste that directly contributes to things like climate change. We\&#39;ve normalized using 10x more servers than is required to deliver a workload with performance-conscious architecture because it is expedient. The &#34;throw hardware at the problem&#34; mentality has gotten out of hand in my opinion.Many people with very eco-aware personal lifestyles write code that is the software equivalent of a coal-fired SUV, oblivious to the contradiction.&#39;,
 &#39;What is lost in this kind of conversations, can be summed at:You pay NOW or pay LATER.Some stuff is VERY hard to add later, and will cost much more:- Security\n- Usability\n- Cross platform\n- Accessibility\n- Type safety/Type hinting \n- PerformanceIf you delay too much in pay attention to this stuff, then the cost later will increase so much. And then only a massive refactoring will fix it (or worse, like in one of my projects, a total change of langs and frameworks!)&#39;,
 &#39;I picked up a codebase where people were optimising for performance throughout the development it\&#39;s now very hard to change or refactor because there are preemptive performance optimisations and caching everywhere (front and backend).It makes far more sense to create an extensible solution and then identify and fix the bottlenecks as the vision about the &#34;final product&#34; (or version x) becomes more clear.&#39;,
 &#39;If you\x92ve used some heavyweight framework then performance will probably be hard to add later. If you wrote the code yourself then I\x92m with Knuth, it\x92s not a big deal to optimize it later and that\x92s a much better way to go.I\x92ve found the following rubric helpful for building distributed systems: 1/ correctness, 2/ reliability, 3/ performance. Credit: CochroachDB team.&#39;,
 &#39;&gt; If someone says:&gt;&gt; &#34;We are building programs correct first, performant later. We will optimize it after it\x92s feature complete.&#34;&gt; It actually means: performance would stay mostly the same, unless those people find some low-hanging fruits that will allow them to make the program fast without changing too much of what they\x92ve already built.I agree with the premise, but not (always) with the overall conclusion of the article. If you go preformance-first, you should also go security-first, usability-first, and accessibility-first. All of those factors are harder to implement afterwards than when it\&#39;s being done from the beginning. But there\&#39;s also the other side - you may come up with a performant, secure, usable and accessible application that is lacking core features, making the product useless. There\&#39;s no silver bullet, but _not_ going performance-first is totally fine in some cases (especially prototypes / MVPs).&#39;,
 &#34;&gt; I\x92m saying these improvements are accidental. It\x92s sheer luck they happened.No. They&#39;re not accidental. They&#39;re entirely intentional, done by sheer hard work.On a related note, I am surprised a person who claims to write about UI design has a website with that background color. The contrast is just awful.&#34;,
 &#39;This is better expressed as &#34;consider performance from the start&#34;. Don\&#39;t make it your #1 priority and don\&#39;t ignore and neglect it either. Do sensible things:1. use hash (or ordered) collections rather than scanning large-ish arrays2. use reasonable database schemas and indices for queries3. similarly consider correctness (e.g. constraints)4. one place where earlier versions can skimp are sometimes algorithms to be replaced by better ones. Think of this as \&#39;doing things that don\&#39;t scale\&#39; which is fine for an MVP but do have a plan for how this will be updated if you\&#39;re fortunate enough to need it.5. good fore-thought is to offload work to the client in the design which does scale better.6. don\&#39;t do any/much caching early on and make choices that are compatible with adding caching later&#39;,
 &#39;&gt; Let me put it this way: \x93Premature optimization being the root of all evil\x94 is the root of all evil.The disconnect for most people is that optimization does not necessarily mean \x93performance\x94. It can mean optimizing for reusability, compatibility, objected-orientedness. Basically trying to optimize for a use case that you don\x92t have yet. I see this happen all the time with people optimizing to make their solution more general. It makes the code more complex and it may never be used in a general case.If you are trying to build a performance piece of software, then you should absolutely be optimizing for that from the start. That\x92s not premature optimization, that\x92s meeting your design goals.&#39;,
 &#34;The author here seems to be missing the basic point of the phrase. Others have correctly noted that performance is a feature, but even with that taken for granted, it is not often apparent what the constraints of the full system are until they&#39;ve been built. You may try and guess, but you&#39;re more likely to guess wrong than right. Look at OSes, ISAs, DBs, etc. All of those have been rewritten numerous times not because the originals paid no attention to what performance would be like, but rather because they did not know how to improve performance until they had something they could test.&#34;,
 &#34;Eh, there&#39;s a gray area here. Your priorities really depend on the type of project you&#39;re making.Let&#39;s say you&#39;re building a web app for a SaaS business. Wouldn&#39;t it be more important to make your code refactorable and develop features quickly? If you spend lots of time on [Feature X]&#39;s performance and customers turn out to _not use_ [Feature X], you&#39;ve just wasted your time and money \x97 basically your runway, your livelihood. Basically, if a feature isn&#39;t worth making, is it worth making well? :)Maybe this is good advice if you&#39;re working on a different type of project though.&#34;,
 &#34;I think it depends on if your design is conducive to performance or not and this is the cross-purpose here.If you&#39;ve architected a bunch of end points that are chatty and jump layers in a weave of a tangled mess or built an app infrastructure that never isolates expensive operations and just arbitrarily inlines them, then you&#39;ll struggle to optimise it later.But if your architecture is relatively sane and your data model apt for the features at hand and those on the horizon then finding hotspots and improving performance many times fold is totally doable later.&#34;,
 &#34;High performance code can often be an order of magnitude longer and more complex to write than moderately performant code. When you&#39;re not even sure what you&#39;re building yet, aiming for performance first is a waste of time and a good way to ensure you end up not realising anything at all.Optimise for what&#39;s important for your specific project. Maybe exploring the design space is the priority to start. Maybe releasing before the end of the year is more important.Not all projects are the same so it&#39;s pointless to argue about  general rules like this.&#34;,
 &#39;Improving performance after the fact is a lot harder than you might think, depending on the nature of your application and it\&#39;s users behavior, it can be a very steep uphill struggle to realise even small gains. Here\&#39;s an issue I recently ran into.When I was tasked to increase performance of a legacy web app, I thought there were so many &#34;quick wins&#34; that I could take a VERY slow application (we\&#39;re talking 10s long requests for most pages) and get most pages down to less than 3s per request, and at MOST 5s for all of themOne example was permissions being stored in a long &#34;bitmap&#34; string of 1\&#39;s and 0\&#39;s that was being parsed on each page load (it was hundreds of &#34;bits&#34; long). The code to handle this was beyond awful complexity wise and added 2s per page load to parse. Some simple refactors and 2s removed from each and every page load. There were a bunch of things like this too, I was on a roll fixing these things.In my dev environment I set up some performance test harnesses (replaying real world traffic from a representative amount of users) and got benchmarks indicating that i\&#39;d increased performance by about 4 times on average. It was still sluggish, but no longer unusable. When I deployed, I found the site was only 1.5 to 2 times as fast. Not quite enough to hit my very modest goal of Turns out the site was so slow, but we had so many active users that needed to use it, we were suffering something you\&#39;d normally only observe in real life automobile traffic, a phenomenon called &#34;induced demand&#34;. When a site is really slow users won\&#39;t use it unless they absolutely have to. So as you make the site faster they will subconsciously start doing more things things beyond the absolute bare minimum they would normally do. You get stuck fighting some weird kind of &#34;equilibrium&#34; where as the site gets faster you start going below the level of &#34;do what I need and get out&#34; threshold of more and more users who push back by adding more traffic until the site reaches a new equilibrium.So we made the site 4 times as fast, but the amount of requests more than tripled and negated half our gains. Improving performance on a web app of this nature after the fact is a LOT harder than you might think.&#39;,
 &#39;Of course you should consider performance when you start a project - if your language, framework or core design is slow it seems unlikely you\&#39;ll be able to do much to improve it later. You need to at least think about it.But I don\&#39;t think &#34;Premature optimization&#34; is synonymous with &#34;performance&#34;. Optimizing or perfecting every detail of a feature that might still go through significant changes over time seems risky and wasteful.&#39;,
 &#39;Slippery slope here is, how far does one take performance first design?I\x92ve seen too many devs rely on caching as the upfront solution.  That\x92s performance first design, right!?&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m not sure if performance has to be first. One could for example do proof of concept style of work with some higher level language before starting to create the actual product which then should also take the performance aspects under consideration.I think we actually waste a lot of energy by not encouraging our selves to pay attention on the performance. Nature sort of demands efficiency in long run. Yes?&#34;,
 &#39;Avoid \x93premature optimization\x94 doesn\x92t mean avoid \x93optimization\x94.What is \x93premature\x94 is project dependent.It is not premature to start 99% focused on optimization for a project where achieving an efficiency threshold is needed to validate project viability.\x93Avoid premature anything\x94 is tautological.\x93Performance first\x94 violates a tautology. All I need to say about that.We need tautological reminders, because we humans easily forget obviousness in the face of complexity.&#39;,
 &#34;Meh, look at Slack. It&#39;s a matter of priority. For me extensibility, important features and quick bug-fixing is more important than performance. If working on performance gets in the way of any those things, do it later.&#34;,
 &#34;I hope he doesn&#39;t build software like that website&#34;,
 &#34;As I see it, performance only matters if you&#39;re losing more customers or users over it than you gain by having spent that effort on features. And hardware is cheap nowadays. This is also not a linear relationship, performance focused development generally constrains the system which makes refactoring harder which makes new features harder (because you almost certainly did not get the architecture right the first time around).&#34;,
 &#39;The Knuth quote stands. It has been and continues to be one of my favorites. It has served me well.&#39;,
 &#34;the prototype should be crazy fast. as soon as features are added, it&#39;s gonna be slowing down.&#34;,
 &#34;I think this is terrible advice.  There&#39;s plenty of ways to write highly performant, wrong sofware, that contains bugs.  What&#39;s worse than a slow program?  One that doesn&#39;t run.  1/10 of the time.  Whats worse than a program that runs 1/10 of the time?  One that runs with high uptime and resiliency, but handles funds with the wrong sign.&#34;,
 &#34;Using performance as a synonym for only runtime speed doesn&#39;t feel satisfying. Shouldn&#39;t we include quality of results, such as correctness and fulfillment of requirements, in the evaluation of whether a program performs well?&#34;,
 &#39;Javascript has been made fast as a result of huge efforts.&#39;,
 &#39;The colours of this page are an unfortunate choice tbh...&#39;,
 &#39;If the author had said, &#34;Performance &amp; functionality over beauty&#34; it would have made more sense.&#39;,
 &#39;While I agree with the overall feelings that the author expresses -- that people misunderstand &#34;Premature Optimization is the root of all evil&#34;[0] and in doing so treat optimization as something that is &#34;evil&#34; rather than premature optimization.  There are various misunderstandings, which lead to incorrect assumptions which lead to introducing complexity (which is likely to be counterproductive, potentially performance-killing) too early in the development process.  I consider the following quote to be key:     &gt; It\x92s never too early to start measuring and working on performance.\n\nPersonally speaking, when I start feeling this way, I see it as a strong signal that I\&#39;m engaging in optimization too early.  I\&#39;m guided by the idea that time spent attempting to improve performance at early stages is more often wasted, or even self-defeating, than it is useful.  Knowing exactly when is the right time, though, is extremely tricky.Most languages/frameworks have a set of &#34;don\&#39;t do this&#34;-es that fall into the performance category -- knowing these and implementing them when the probability that they will reduce a bottleneck vs. overly-complicate code/implementation is important.  Too often, though, the &#34;performant implementation&#34; is used because other developers are familiar with it -- not because it necessarily helps anything (i.e. using StringBuilder in C# for string concatenation -- in many common implementations, the result is slower but people are so used to seeing it that it becomes &#34;something many developers just do&#34; even though it is substantially uglier).Performance shouldn\&#39;t be an after-thought.  If I\&#39;m expecting that my application must support 10,000 concurrent users on a single host and the work its performing couldn\&#39;t be achieved by a single-threaded server, I\&#39;m going to write the implementation thread-safe from the start.  That\&#39;s not premature optimization, that\&#39;s designing an application.  Provided the hosting constraints are not as rigid, it may make more sense to single-thread the back-end on multiple hosts.  Neither of these are as easy to reason about as a single-threaded, single-host, blocking implementation, but the alternative is &#34;it doesn\&#39;t work at all&#34; (under load, anyway).The problem with measuring/working on performance too early is that the measurements are measurements of code in isolation.  You can\&#39;t measure what isn\&#39;t written and once the various dependencies are introduced, your initial measurements/adjustments for performance may be pointless.  Yes, you sped up the acquisition of a small blob of JSON that takes a notoriously long amount of time to produce, but because you hadn\&#39;t completed the rest of the app, you neglected the fact that another request with 250MB of JSON ran at exactly the same time.  You traded off memory for CPU to speed up the first implementation, but now you need a lot more memory for the one running in parallel and the lack of resources caused swapping, slowing everything down to the point that the original, slower, less-memory-consuming option for your first request was a better choice.The &#34;Premature Optimization is the Root of All Evil&#34; isn\&#39;t a phrase meant to say &#34;Optimization is unimportant and you shouldn\&#39;t waste time on it&#34;.  It\&#39;s a recognition that optimization is extremely important and will almost certainly never happen due to resource exhaustion.  The confusion is about what resource is being exhausted -- the resource is time.  We\&#39;re all constrained by having to write functionality and make it work.  If you want to make it perform well, you\&#39;re going to burn a lot of time on optimization.  You will burn far less time there if you optimize your code when those optimizations are going to have the greatest benefit.  Optimizing too soon means you risk spending a lot of time measuring/tweaking with a result that will not improve performance, or worse, has to be undone.  &#34;Optimized&#34; code is usually more complex/more difficult to reason about, which makes completing the underlying feature-set more difficult.Measuring and optimizing at the right times (and identifying the correct &#34;right times&#34;) maximizes the positive effects of the optimizations and reduce the likelihood that those optimizations will make writing the rest of the code more difficult.  Every program (and kind of program[1]) has a different &#34;right time&#34;.  Determining that &#34;right time&#34; can simply be a matter of planning your hardware / code architecture early enough to know what is actually needed[2] and identifying when one should start reviewing the application for bottlenecks.[0] I have much the same problem that I have with the biblical roots of that phrase and its misunderstanding.  People will often repeat &#34;Money is the root of all evil&#34; but miss the first part of that phrase &#34;... the love of money is the root of all evil.&#34;  With appropriate context, its meaning changes dramatically.[1] Library code vs. a complete program -- My &#34;general libraries&#34; are often micro-optimized to seek the greatest performance while maintaining a balance between memory usage and CPU.  This makes them maximally useful to the vast majority of my consumers.  I might end up ripping those out of an implementation if I find a better trade-off given a complete program\&#39;s function, but most of the time it reduces the need for me to optimize around common bottlenecks[2] Regular check-points / proper planning are as close to a cure for &#34;the roots of all evil&#34; as you can get.  Performance is always a feature in that you know in advance what your applications constraints are and what its requirements are.  Designing code that meets neither isn\&#39;t abiding by the &#34;Premature Optimization&#34; advice; the point is avoiding writing complex implementations that eek out a few extra milliseconds of performance for a code path that is blocked by dependent-data, anyway, which is often the end result of premature optimization.&#39;,
 &#39;I think author also optimized the time it takes for users to click `ctrl+w` from his side. That yellow background is terrible, it gave me a headache.&#39;,

 &#34;The blast radius of CD covers company&#39;s bank accounts.The only way to safely do CD in a customer facing non-toy project ( aka there&#39;s a revenue attached to the project ) is to have stack built from the ground up to support request pinning, request tracing, request shifting in addition to the regular instrumentation monitoring and 100% integration test coverage.One can probably do it if that one is Google or Facebook. You aren&#39;t Google or Facebook. Don&#39;t be a hero. Don&#39;t do CD.&#34;,
 &#39;I have two levels of content saving:1. Every article I will read, I\&#39;ll drop straight into Pocket, to highlight/read. I will never rea the article outright - this is important, because some clickbait can find me in a &#34;vulnerable&#34; state. After this time has passed, I\&#39;d delete it out of my Pocket without reading if I determine it\&#39;s not worth it. I delete about 40% of the stuff I intended to read.\nIn pocket, I would highlight heavily (I have pocket premium)2. All my highlights, notes from the books I read, my Tweets, articles that I write and newsletters I send end up in my Evernote.\nThis gives me the single source of truth for the knowledge I am gathering. I can instantly search for a figure from an article I\&#39;ve read 3 years ago. I organize it by topic and treat it as a &#34;Commonplace Book&#34;.As such, this is not for organizing &#34;Links&#34;, because I dont care about links. I care about quickly finding the piece of information I\&#39;ve seen on the web, and -of course - proper attribution.&#39;,
 &#39;I\x92ve mostly given up, since web developers seem to have forgotten that URIs should be stable. If there\x92s a 50% chance it\x92ll be gone when I go to look for it, it\x92s not worth the effort to me.This is like reason #17 why I wish we had a hypertext system (like we used to have) that was separate from the application deployment system (that\x92s been given to us).&#39;,
 &#34;I usually send bookmarks to my separate email account. I add excerpts and quotes from the bookmark that I find interesting, also helps with searching.Every few weeks I conduct housekeeping on my email. This moves the good bookmarks over to my personal git wiki or deleted. This ensures that every bookmark I have gets visited at least twice. This also allows me to not overthink before adding a bookmark without ending up with incomprehensible huge lists of bookmarks that I never end up re-visiting.I&#39;ve learned over the years to keep this system simple. Understand and realize that whatever bookmark system you use will eventually go away. If its good enough, they will try to monetize, if not they will be forced to close shop. Either way it gets killed, at least for me.Another side note: not all bookmarks are equal. Some are just references you want handy when you want to point someone to them, usually in an online argument where response time matters. Some links have golden content on the other side.  You want to read, re-read, internalize and remember (spaced repetition) this. Some are work related. Some are aspirational stuff you want to get to in the future. So knowing what and why I am bookmarking something was key to keeping it real.&#34;,
 &#39;I use Firefox Developer Edition as my primary browser and Firefox Sync to store and sync bookmarks across devices.I have made 95%(2000+) of my bookmarks public on GitHub[0]. I have categorized them and host them on a public repository(110+ forks, ~1800 stars) and push every week. I have also made the entire repo available as a GitBook with search and export as PDF functionality.[0] https://github.com/rsapkf/goodies&#39;,
 &#39;Relevant discussion from few days ago: &#34;Ask HN: How do you manage your bookmarks?&#34; https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22105561I capture a lot of bookmarks into my org-mode and I don\&#39;t spend much time deliberately curating. Once in few weeks I go through captured bookmarks and quickly assign a priority to each one (just a matter of pressing hotkey). Then I sort everything by priority, typically ending up with 10-15 higher priority ones that I would tag, put into my reading queue, refile etc.Rest of it isn\&#39;t curated and serves as my personal search engine [0]. Often instead of searching in google I\&#39;d first search in my emacs and find some relevant information in my knowledge base.In addition, I\&#39;m working on promnesia [1], a browser addon that integrates links in my org-mode files with my browser. E.g.\n- when I visit some blog, it would show me that I\&#39;ve got few blog posts from that blog bookmarked (along with my private notes and annotations), which typically means that the blog is worth exploring more\n- when I visit someone\&#39;s twitter profile it might prompt that I\&#39;ve retweeted/favorited some of that person\&#39;s tweets[0] https://beepb00p.xyz/pkm-search.html#personal_information[1] https://github.com/karlicoss/promnesia#demo&#39;,
 &#34;I honestly stopped bookmarking for real when firefox introduced the awesome bar. Just typing any fragment I recall into the address bar made them pretty much obsolete for most of my use cases.\nEvery time I&#39;m forced to use chrome for some stuff I am surprised how unusable the browser is without this feature. I&#39;m sure you can fix that with some extension or other but I don&#39;t see why it wouldn&#39;t be a default.&#34;,
 &#34;I&#39;ve tried dozens of services through the years and have always come away disappointed. I literally just want to store a URL and the page title \x97 just text will do. I don&#39;t want an overwhelming visual list of my bookmarks. I don&#39;t want the page content scraped and stored. I don&#39;t need to share my bookmarks (other than syncing across devices). I would like some easy way to flag and clean up old 404-ing bookmarks. Simple categorisation or tagging. And a simple one-click add-to-inbox plugin that&#39;d work on all my browsers including on iOS. And I&#39;d like a good-looking UI \x97 not an ugly mess like Pinboard. And of course there should be a solid export interface so that users aren&#39;t locked into some proprietary data structure.As a product designer I&#39;d love to sink my teeth into this problem but unfortunately it&#39;s a dev-heavy project and that&#39;s outside my comfort-zone.For now I&#39;m sticking with my fallback solution \x97 dozens of &#39;link dump&#39; notes in the Mac Notes app. It&#39;s searchable, lightweight, and flexible but a nightmare to manage. There must be something better out there.&#34;,
 &#34;I used to hoard bookmarks to never look at them again. It wasn&#39;t adding any tangible value to my life, so I got rid of that habit.What I&#39;m doing now instead, is curating a set of links around some topics, and sharing them publicly. The most portable way of storing and presenting them is either an HTML page on one of my websites or a markdown file mirrored to Github. That way I can be sure that my data isn&#39;t locked into some proprietary format by an entity who might get Incredible Journey-ed for whatever reasons.Here are my personal favorites: https://jmstfv.com/bookmarksAnd here&#39;s the curated list of businesses publicly sharing their expenses: https://github.com/jmstfv/open-expenses&#34;,
 &#34;I have a system of subscribing to RSS feeds and following accounts on Twitter as my source of news and continuing education, starring/bookmarking/favoriting items that look interesting, then returning later to read them - a two-pass filter basically.  I&#39;ll then remove items I&#39;ve read if I don&#39;t plan to return to them later.In order to view all these saved links as well as share with anyone interested, I created a website to republish them all on one page:https://savedforlater.devThere&#39;s more info about the philosophy and implementation on GitHub, as well as all the source: https://github.com/jacobwgillespie/saved-for-later.&#34;,
 &#34;I use Emacs org mode capture and syncthing and org-protocol via Firefox.On a page that I think may be useful I click a menu item in firefox which activates org-protocol sending the URL to an Emacs server, starting Emacs if needed.  Emacs prompts me for some tags and then makes an entry in an org file which I sync to all my computers, home and work, via syncthing.  I&#39;ll then either simply close the Emacs frame or if appropriate leave it open while I read through the page and add notes to the org entry.  Later, if I have reason to revisit then I&#39;ll search on terms my brain is able to associate and that hits on the tags, text or page title that were stored.Scripts and configuration are propagated to different computers using Git via a personal Gitea instance and vcsh/myrepo tools.&#34;,
 &#34;Not really. Long-form things that I want to read later, I put into Pocket [0]. Everything else I don&#39;t bookmark, I can just search for it later, or it&#39;s lost forever like tears in rain.0: https://getpocket.com/&#34;,
 &#39;I built my own service and client as a hobby project to scrape and categorise articles for myself. I realised throughout the project though what a monumental pain scraping article content reliably is and have have spent less time on it lately, I still dogfood it however.&#39;,
 &#34;We built a free tool for exactly this: https://itemsy.com/You can save links in the web app, via email, browser extension or pull automatically by integrating with a Medium blog or any RSS feed. Link collections get automatically turned into an email newsletter that can be personal, public or shared within a group.We recently launched &#39;Picked for you&#39; which suggests links you might find interesting. Also, we launch new features daily so feedback and requests are more than welcome!&#34;,
 &#39;Pinboard. Cheap, and works very easily.&#39;,
 &#39;A couple of people have mentioned Evernote, which is a great product, and a great service, with a great plugin for Chromium-based browsers (even Edgium!). However, I love me some markdown, so I\&#39;ve started using Boostnote for my actual &#34;thought&#34; notes. I like it quite a bit, and I\&#39;ve found a few tools that help me &#34;clip&#34; articles from the web and turn them into markdown. So far, I prefer `clean-mark` (https://github.com/croqaz/clean-mark#readme), because it has more consistent conversion and better meta-data generation, but I\&#39;ve also used `hget` (https://github.com/bevacqua/hget), which, in my experience, is not as robust but sometimes catches things that `clean-mark` misses.&#39;,
 &#39;I have written a service where I store link, timestamp and addendum where I can explain why I went to that link, and a counter for &#34;if this link already exists in the database&#34; then increment. I save links when I have too many tabs open so as to close them. This gives me a way to query on those links at a later point of time in mysql command line. It has worked well so far.&#39;,
 &#39;I use https://linkblog.ioI have the custom domain feature configured so all my links are here:https://links.markjgsmith.comFull disclosure - I\x92m the founder and lead developer, I haven\x92t launched yet on HN but if anyone wants to try it out feel free to setup an account.&#39;,
 &#39;I use and develop https://tefter.ioI tend to organise links in lists. Some examples:* https://tefter.io/zorbash/lists/ruby-rails\n* https://tefter.io/zorbash/lists/devops\n* https://tefter.io/zorbash/lists/elixir-resources\n* https://tefter.io/zorbash/lists/web-development&#39;,
 &#34;Let&#39;s just say I&#39;m seriously dissatisfied by how I deal with them. After trying multiple variants I (once again) ended up basically just using Pocket (which I hate and promise myself to replace by Wallabag or such, but... yeah) for everything I&#39;m going to read (removing permanently after it&#39;s done), and just bookmarking everything I want to keep between history cleanups in my address bar suggestions without sorting much.I would like to use bookmarks more, assigning tags, using them in my planning, but Firefox bookmarks just suck and I end up spending too much time without any benefits. There were some external tools for that, but they aren&#39;t better than a plain text file because of poor browser integration.Anything that can be annotated and put into context ends up somewhere in my *.md notes.&#34;,
 &#34;I hope this doesn&#39;t sound overly self-promotional, but I have a newsletter with around 1500 subscribers (and a few Patreon supporters) which I started a few years back to address a very personal issue of bookmarking/curation: I realised I was storing tons of links which I never visited and forgot about, but that certain links sort of stuck with me and I kept talking about them, most of which related to data.So I started sending them out as a curated list of a handful of links per week, alongside a short explanation of why it mattered or a quote.8 years later, I still sort of remember if I sent something, and I no longer use bookmarks.&#34;,
 &#39;i think that bookmarks will solve search. see my thoughts here: https://www.pythondashboard.com/articles/2020-01-23-search.h...apologies for site not being done yet and article not fully fleshed out. but the topic has come back many times now that i think i needed to share what i thought about it.to answer your question: we need to share and distribute our bookmarks in GitHub. it works for developers because our search queries are keyword-based.pocket, pinboard.in, etc. don\&#39;t work because they feel like &#34;todo&#34; lists.&#39;,
 &#34;I use HN submissions as a better bookmark/log of what I&#39;ve been reading that day (or previous day). Usually post things I might want to revisit later.I use browser bookmark folders only for links for private stuff e.g. fun+memes, cooking, curated lists of , ... Also I maintain markdown files for documenting changes/tweaks and modifications made to various machines on my network.As a VI user I never looked at org-mode before. I&#39;ll probably do so in 2020 (https://github.com/jceb/vim-orgmode).&#34;,
 &#39;I built a tool to let me do this: https://www.homepagr.comIt is intended to replace the \x93new tab\x94 page of the browser and works really well!When I first \x93launched\x94 it had a minimal set of features and scratched my own itch. I wanted to charge $12/year. However, I discovered that nobody even wanted to pay $1 per month!I\x92ve since created designs for a new UX, which is what you see in the screenshots, and put up a landing page. All out of the startup playbook. However, nobody has expressed an interest in the product, so I haven\x92t opened up access for others.&#39;,
 &#34;If the link has any value then I will put them in an internal wiki along with the details on why they are interesting.This makes them easy to find again at any later time due to mediawiki&#39;s excellent built-in search facilities.&#34;,
 &#39;There was a thread about this 6 days ago https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22105561&#39;,
 &#34;I blog. I can&#39;t seem to get significant traction in terms of an audience, but I very often can find some link I want for some reason because I blogged about it. In cases where searching the internet or searching HN is failing me, it&#39;s often been a huge relief to turn to my own writing and unearth it in short order.It&#39;s a primary reason I continue to run my big fat mouth on blogs the rest of the world largely seems to have a yawning disinterest in most of the time.&#34;,
 &#34;I do curate my bookmarks, in the sense that I&#39;m renaming them (the website title is sometimes way too long and bloated, and I put tags on them to find them where I believe they might be relevant (ex: note-taking, selfhosted, e2ee)If the website contains an important bit of info, I try to send the page to the Wayback Machine so that it&#39;s not lost to time when the website eventually dies, and I also copy that info in my notes (currently using Joplin)&#34;,
 &#39;What I\x92ve found is that it really doesn\x92t matter which tool you use. There\x92s many options that will allow you to manage your bookmarks, consider a simple txt file.The challenging bit is providing a sound enough structure so every item finds a place almost organically. If it\x92s a simple list then it can take a while to find a specific entry and if it\x92s too categorised you\x92ll run into a similar problem. I like to use trees with symlinks.&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m really careful with bookmarking now. I found a txt file backup of my del.icio.us account from 2004, I couldn&#39;t find a single link which still worked. There was some gold which I would have loved to be able to look at again.If something is interesting enough to keep I clip in into Evernote and tag it, then I can be confident it will be there when I go looking for it at some undefined point in the future.&#34;,
 &#39;Yes, of course I do. I collect bookmarks in many places. Easy to access every day use bookmarks are in my Firefox bookmarks. Others are in my chrome browser which I use for different browsing and the one I want to keep forever I use https://yabs.io which allows me to search and tag bookmarks.&#39;,
 &#39;I used to do this for a few years: https://f5n.org/stack - but my interests have shifted a little and not too many people gave any feedback or indication that they read it.These days I just save them to Pinboard, like I used to, and sometimes go back and find something I vaguely remember...&#39;,
 &#39;I use a self-hosted wallabag for long-form articles that I want to get back to or are part of a particular string of research and it ensures I can always read it even if it disappears.Bookmark wise I mostly just use the standard bookmark manager. I have considered a self-hosted syncing mechanism but I only have a few hundred bookmarks, it is stuff I use.&#39;,
 &#39;Yes, I do.I put every blog, site I want to follow on my freshrss instance(rss.ishanjain.me).I use Reeder(on iOS) and FeedMe(on Android) to read those posts. When I like something, I add it to Pocket where it gets archived and stuff and I can revisit it later at any point.I use Browser bookmarks to store interesting websites, Like tools, Stuff other than articles basically.&#39;,
 &#34;We built a tool for this as we had the same problem. A place you can collect, tag and share you links in a visual way. Right now it&#39;s only for articles, videos (YouTube) and films, but will expand into other domains. Have fun, let us know if I can help you navigate it. dean@discovereel.com  www.discovereel.com&#34;,
 &#34;I started to use https://getmemex.com/ a few months ago. It&#39;s working nice for now (locally stored, screenshots, text search, include results in duckduckgo, ...)Worth a try I would say, but I won&#39;t make a definitive recommendation for now.&#34;,
 &#39;Currently using Pocket to quickly bookmark important articles. Their simple tagging system allows us to organize links by topic. We have a &#34;read later&#34; tag for quick bookmarks and after reviewing content we will add a new topical tag. Sharing with peers is easy as well.&#39;,
 &#39;https://pinboard.in does exactly what you are asking for, additionally it keeps an archive of the pages (Similar to archive.org) and you can see public bookmarks of your &#34;friends&#34; on the service.&#39;,
 &#39;I use RSS to quell the internet firehose, specifically Feedbin (also great for Twitter lists).I do a fair bit of reading in Feedbin. Anything I read and want to save, I tag and send to Pinboard. If I want to read it later, I mark it as such and also send it to Pinboard.&#39;,
 &#39;I use Inoreader\&#39;s &#34;Save to Inoreader&#34; bookmarklet which lets you tag and save the link which can be accessed across devices. Their search works well enough on the saved links and they have a very generous free tier.&#39;,
 &#34;You could just bookmark everything, and use tags for specific categories.Maybe add a &#39;ril&#39; tag for every thing you want to read later, no tags for generic queue of things to look at, &#39;archive&#39; for things you want to keep, etc.&#34;,
 &#39;I use checkvist.com to curate. I have both links and saved information, organized to multiple levels.  I back up monthly.  I have over 10,000 lines in my straight text backup.  I share this list with friends and acquaintances.&#39;,
 &#39;I share some links on my blog: https://jlelse.blog/links/.Articles I plan to read later are saved in Pocket and archived after I read them.&#39;,
 &#39;I built a search engine that searches content from all of my bookmarks and links.  When I find a good site, I just add it. https://cowjar.com&#39;,
 &#34;I use Bookmark OS which let&#39;s you share and collaborate on folders of bookmarks https://bookmarkos.com/&#34;,
 &#34;I&#39;ve used pocket for many years to collect articles and web pages that I want to read later, and kept using it almost by default when Mozilla took it over and integrated it into Firefox.&#34;,
 &#34;I use Joplin, and make my own awesome lists. Sometimes I&#39;ll just use their webclipper app to clip parts of pages for my own &#39;doc&#39; system for things I want to remember.&#34;,
 &#39;Not really but usually i send them to me in my chat in telegram&#39;,
 &#39;I do, but what I noticed is that I rarely reopen them, so I use a random bookmark opener to open a random bookmarked item everyday.&#39;,
 &#39;i m not &#34;the tech community&#34; , but i created my own: https://pinplz.com . I use it to store things to read later or lists of things i m searching for.How it differentiates: single click save - keeps track of the referer if possible - show a QR code - keeps a cached copy&#39;,
 &#34;Check out my https://histre.com/The main reason behind my building Histre is the idea that we throw away a lot of the signal we generate while doing things online and this can be put to good use for ourselves.Bookmark management is just a special case of knowledge management. What you really need is a knowledge management tool that is easy to use. You&#39;ll get a ton of other benefits too.As it is right now, Histre aids the casual online research we all do (ie the explore -&gt; filter -&gt; decide loop). For example, it removes friction in taking notes on links you&#39;re looking at, with free-form tags that you don&#39;t have to create first and other such niceties that add up. And it easy to group notes into notebooks and share. In short, when you have to look at a bunch of links for something (decide on AirBnB, people to hire, material for your next blog post, etc) Histre makes your life easier. But this is just the starting point for what Histre intends to do.IMHO the biggest problem with apps like Evernote, Notion etc is that it becomes digital hoarding, and not a knowledge base. And the knowledge base focused apps out there involve a lot of manual upkeep, which almost never happens, especially at work. Things start out okay and quickly fall into disrepair. I&#39;m differentiating from the other note taking apps by automatically putting together a knowledge base (grouped by topic etc).One idea I&#39;m excited about and I&#39;m working on right now is: Histre automatically fetches updates from the websites you visit, ranks the websites with things like lack of ads / referral links and ranks the new posts with your &#39;revealed preferences&#39; of what you tend to actually read from the list of updates previously shown etc. Personally I think this is will be what replaces social news sites, which are too sensitive to people who bother to go upvote on /new and has to cater to the lowest common denominator.Automatic Upkeep (WIP): Histre detects links/notes related to your existing notebooks and offers to update those notebooks with the new links and notes. This is similar to how Google Photos suggests new photos for your existing albums. This solves the upkeep problem. Currently people create knowledge bases with good intentions and it becomes stale and useless quite fast.Exports: I&#39;m working on org-mode exports, as I&#39;m an Emacs user myself. Other export formats coming soon.Integrations: There is Hacker News (import and optionally share your upvotes) and Telegram (take notes using the Telegram app) integrations now. I&#39;m working on Twitter next (lists of Twitter profiles -&gt; follow all / block all).&#34;,
 &#39;Pinboard.in and/or Trello&#39;,
 &#39;I use Notion for this kind of stuff. Free, crossplatform and easy to operate&#39;,

 &#39;This seems very low quality. And it ends with:&gt; the alphabet\x92s letters are in that order because they have simply always been that way.Seriously? Like before the universe?Quick search leads to Wikipedia (obviously) which actually tries to answer the question: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_alphabet#Letter...Interestingly, first sounds and &#34;words&#34; produced by human babies are quite similar to the sounds the starting letters of most alphabets produce (&#34;baba&#34;, &#34;dada&#34;, &#34;gaga&#34; etc): https://www.webmd.com/parenting/baby-talk-your-babys-first-w...So the answer may be in biology / evolution.&#39;,
 &#34;The answer is because the script evolved and was not designed so letters appear in somewhat random order.Brahmi, which is the parent script for most Indian scripts as well as a bunch of other scripts in the region (Tibetan, Thai, Burmese, Javanese etc.), has a well-designed alphabet ordering. Simple vowels come first, followed by dipthongs, followed by constants. Consonants themselves are ordered as velar first, followed by palatals, retroflexes, dental and finally labial consonants -- notice the articulation point is moving from the back to the front of the mouth. Within each group the ordering is unvoiced, unvoiced aspirated, voiced, voiced aspirated and finally nasal consonant. It&#39;s a thing of beauty.&#34;,
 &#39;&#34;So the order has ancient roots, but where does it come from?I hate to disappoint you, but we\&#39;re really not sure. The practice of having the letters in an established order makes sense: It\x92s easier to teach and to learn. Why some ancient people put them in that specific order, though, is unknown. Whoever did it didn\x92t leave any record that we know of explaining why they lined the letters up like that.&#34;https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/29011/why-are-letters-ab...&#39;,
 &#34;This doesn&#39;t answer the question, but it&#39;s a great TMBG song: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRYw-pqSdKo&#34;,
 &#34;A lot of words to basically not answer the question. \n Honestly, he doesn&#39;t even come close.&#34;,

 &#34;Would that this article didn&#39;t have dumb impact font memes.&#34;,
 &#39;&gt; English is considered a very difficult language to master due to the inconsistencies in it, as well as the different ways you can pronounce any given letter.This is a huge pet peeve of mine. The writer hedges this statement with the passive voice, and &#34;master&#34; is difficult to qualify, but generally speaking English is not a difficult language.  I\&#39;ll concede that phonics are a mess, but it\&#39;s not riddled with more inconsistencies than most other world languages.&#39;,
 &#39;Right here is when Tevye jumps in and starts singing &#34;tradition!&#34;It\&#39;s because ancestor and cousin scripts used the phonetic glyphs for numbers as well, and the ordering had to be fixed.Once Indo-Arabic numerals made it in to the character set, the need for strict ordering went away.  But now that characters have numeric values again (ASCII, Unicode), they\&#39;re fixed forever.&#39;,
 &#39;If you find this article interesting, you would probably enjoy this great podcast about the history of English:https://historyofenglishpodcast.com/episodes/He goes into much more detail. He has a separate audiobook that focus on the evolution of the alphabet.&#39;,
 &#34;Is it true, or some strange legend, that &#39;ampersand&#39; used to be at the end of the Alphabet Song? And it was written \n&#39;and per se And&#39; meaning the &#39;and&#39; sign, which was considered a letter at the time. And got sung and mangled/mondegreened into &#39;ampersand&#39;?&#34;,
 &#39;What a frustrating article to read.tldr;&#34;Why Are Alphabet Letters Arranged How They Are?&#34;Because the Greeks modified the Phoenician alphabet a bit, and used that order.&#34;Well...why was the Phoenician alphabet arranged the way it was?&#34;&#39;,
 &#39;I recently learned Sanskrit and it was shockinh to find the order being so scientific.Guttural palatal  dental labialAnd in the order aspirated unaspiratedPretty cool.&#39;,
 &#34;Isn&#39;t it because in Hebrew (and other ancient languages) the letters are also numbers?&#34;,
 &#39;Can we stop putting dumb memes in blog post in 2020?&#39;,
 &#34;They&#39;re in alphabetical order.&#34;,
 &#39;So that singing the alphabet song we learned as a child is more melodic.&#39;,
 &#39;They probably arranged them that way to match the Alphabet Song.&#39;,
 &#39;to prevent old mechanical typewriters from jamming&#39;,
 &#39;&gt; English is considered a very difficult language to master due to the inconsistencies in itBy whom? I don\x92t think it would be hard for a person who knows a language from Standard Average European Sprachbund to learn English compared to, say, Chinese, Arabic or Bengali.&#39;,
 &#34;Why we&#39;ve made the Web like this in 2020?\nIt&#39;s horrible, we need to fix it and never repeat these mistakes.\nhttps://imgur.com/3wX5GmV - screenshot of this site when I&#39;ve opened it.&#34;,
 &#39;I don\&#39;t think I\&#39;d ever give up the internet altogether, but I wonder if there is a place for more thoughtful interaction with the internet - e.g. like how RMS browses(has a daemon download a page and email it to him for offline viewing).You can still access all the information that way, but the &#34;click -&gt;dopamine hit, click -&gt;dopamine hit, etc&#34; training like you might get scrolling through reddit or social media feeds is interrupted by the time delayed nature of your browsing.&#39;,
 &#39;&gt; To keep reading this story, create a free account.Unskippable this time too. Reader view doesn\x92t help. Turning off JS doesn\x92t help.Medium has gotten worse and worse. At this point it is literally unusable.&#39;,
 &#39;When I saw (actually, misread) the title I was hoping it would be about Samuel R Delany\&#39;s &#34;Stars in My Pocket Like Grains of Sand&#34; which is a complete knock-out SF book and probably the best thing Delany ever did. Oh well.https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Stars_in_My_Pocket_Like_Grains_o...&#39;,
 &#39;It often feels as though almost everything on the internet post 2000 or so has been an enormous bait and switch. Build a good service people like, get a lot of people hooked on it, and then gradually fuck it up in an attempt to generate some kind of revenue.I, personally, hate it. Its depressing to see a technology so full of promise (seem to, anyway) regress. Become less magical, less useful. Its no wonder young people are skeptical of capitalism - it seems to literally be eating the goose. Not even the goose that laid the golden egg - just the goose, in hopes there might be a golden egg inside.&#39;,
 &#34;This is such bs.  You choose how to use the tech, if it is taking over your life, maybe look in the mirror?  There were idiots before smartphones is what I&#39;m saying.Social media seems to magnify idiots making it look like society is 99% idiots now.  It&#39;s not remotely true, but maybe it&#39;s having a bad effect?&#34;,
 &#39;Depends on the project:Firebase Authentication[1] is an excellent easy add on for apps (both Web and Mobile) that I want to get running quickly. It\&#39;s free, scales, supports lots of social auth providers and can take care of email verification etc.When I\&#39;m building a website it really depends. Wordpress and Django have excellent inbuilt authentication and authorization systems. Djangos can be quickly expanded to support social providers with `django-allauth`[2]For everything else I use KeyCloak[3] - Red Hats open source Identity Provider/Single Sign On which supports oAuth2.0, OpenID Connect, SAML, themes etc. Documentation and support is relatively good but can be quite overwhelming especially if you\&#39;re not used to the relevant standards (knowing the different flows in oAuth2.0 and which one you want to use).[Self plug]: I\&#39;m building a KeyCloak-as-a-Service for those who don\&#39;t want control of their authentication without the hassle of setting up their own cluster. We\&#39;re in closed Beta at the moment but if you\&#39;re interested you can search for &#34;Tromsso keycloak&#34;[4] and leave an email to be invited in.[1] https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/[2] https://github.com/pennersr/django-allauth[3] https://keycloak.org/[4] https://tromsso.com/&#39;,
 &#34;Firebase Authentication.I can&#39;t say enough good things about this service as it has been a game changer for me productivity wise.-Supports most of the popular OAuth providers natively or you can add any custom OAuth system via custom tokens.-SMS Auth, passwordless login (aka magic links)-Excellent and well maintained client/server SDKs for most of the languages. Makes user management very convenient, including neat things like revoking tokens, cookie session management, linking accounts of users with multiple providers, RBAC via web tokens.-Tight integration with Firestore. Can have fine grained security controls on which users can read/write what documents etc.What takes the cake is Custom Tokens [1]. This is really useful for seamlessly integrating with another authentication system. Would recommend anyone to take a look if they&#39;re exploring an auth service.[1] https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/create-custom-to...&#34;,
 &#34;I&#39;m storing hashed password in the database. I&#39;m writing POST http handler and storing user info in the session information. I don&#39;t know why would I use framework or even service, it&#39;s just few dozens of simple lines of code. I don&#39;t use frameworks for simple things. I guess it might make sense when one need to support login via Google, Facebook, etc, I&#39;m working on enterprise websites which don&#39;t need that.&#34;,
 &#34;Last time AWS Cognito, and at least initially, Amplify.I&#39;d never write it from scratch. It&#39;s always a PITA, there&#39;s always significant compromises - do you make people sign up, do you let them use Google/every other available federated login provider, what 2FA options, will it work on a locked down network, etc.&#34;,
 &#34;Warning: this post is about a speculative design unproven in production. Definitely use the de facto standard framework in any production code you write!I get so depressed with authentication complexity. Seems to me there are two ways to avoid it: first, write a service that doesn&#39;t care about user identity (it is a fun exercise to think of such a thing!), and second, secure messages, not connections or sessions.Securing messages with public/private key encryption, I believe, is the best possible general approach. Thinking in messages yields the programmer great benefits, not just inside code (it is the cornerstone of the OOP paradigm, after all), but outside of code (message passing is also the cornerstone of distributed programming). Even if you are building a webapp it helps to think in terms of something more general. HTTP becomes just another channel over which messages move. Your app can (and probably will) become sensitive to other channels: email, SMS, webhooks, etc. If you embrace message-level security then you can ignore the channel and deal with the message. Channels may change, but your application code doesn&#39;t need to.For an SPA, the key problem (no pun intended) is that a users private key is on the users browser, in the simplest implementation, accessible by everything on the page. If you&#39;re not end-to-end encrypted and don&#39;t use 3rd party resources at all (its possible!) then the naive solution is fine. The most robust solution is to use a browser extension to isolate the private key. The site requests encryption services from the extension.Another fun and interesting problem is the multi-device user. Do we allow copying the private key, and if not, how do we associate private keys together? I think this is a fun problem from lots of angles, particularly the prospect of your own devices inviting each other to share an identity.&#34;,
 &#34;I use bcrypt to hash the user password and then store it in a database. When the user wants to log in I use the compare function of the bcrypt library. If the hashes match I set a session cookie.I suppose if I worked on projects that wanted to support OAuth I would use Passport.js,  but I don&#39;t know how much I would trust the any but the largest packages for that.&#34;,
 &#39;I use Auth0. Works well enough&#39;,
 &#39;I use https://www.pomerium.io/ for my internal services with Google oauth. I like it because unlike oauth-proxy I can define which users are allowed to which (sub)domains. I run this in Kubernetes and it supports forward authentication, so adding a new service is editing a configmap to let pomerium know about the domain and its allowed users (support for defining this in the ingress is coming), and adding a few ingress annotations.&#39;,
 &#39;In some Rails projects i use Device gem, or simpler version made by my own (salted passwords in database, and user_id as jwt in session store).&#39;,
 &#34;I use keycloak. It&#39;s just like auth0 except it&#39;s self hosted and I run it alongside all my other instances.&#34;,
 &#39;I\&#39;m not currently solving it that way but my next side project definitely is going to try out metamask as the mean of authenticating the user.A friend of mine showed me some &#34;dapps&#34;(decentralized apps) that he uses (uniswap.io, axieinfinity.com and some other i forgot). They all used metamask as the &#34;login platform&#34;. The point is that you have your key in this metamask plugin that is stored in your browser and you can sign things. That means you get a challenge from the server and metamask then asks you if you want to sign that challenge.\nThe hole onboarding experience was super easy and you theoretically could use that to pay for some premium features of a service.I thought that is really cool because you don\&#39;t need to enter email, username, password and whatnot. You just click authorize and you\&#39;re in.&#39;,
 &#39;I use Django\x92s included authentication.&#39;,
 &#34;Simple:  Don&#39;t.  Developing a secure authentication service is actually more difficult than it would seem on the surface.  I&#39;ve come to rely on an external authentication service (or, if necessary, a reputable library/framework specifically designed for it).  These days my go-to is Keycloak (https://keycloak.org).  It supports pretty much everything:  standard username/password, MFA, SAML, OIDC, etc.  Plus, it&#39;s easily deployable within a Docker container so standing it up is a breeze.&#34;,
 &#34;I have been implementing different methods for oauth:\n- building my own handling with hashed passwords stored in the database\n- using the fantastic sorcery [0] gem for Rails. It&#39;s a light-weight auth solution that allows me to customize many different aspects of auth while providing a solid structure. It also has many sub modules that can be added for oauth, resetting password or stronger application security.[0] https://github.com/sorcery/sorcery/&#34;,
 &#39;My users send their password over TLS. I check the password using bcrypt. I assume further communication over the same connection comes from the user.&#39;,
 &#39;Laravel built in auth, Socialite for social logins.&#39;,
 &#34;I am working on a hyper-open, hyper-compatible, and hyper-accessible forum system with accessibility by historic browser included in the spec.I use a multi-layer authentication system with various levels of compatibility, security, and accessibility.* The default mode is unauthenticated, which allows the user to post plaintext. Optionally, this can be backed by a device fingerprint, which would group all of this user&#39;s posts together. This is supported by all post-Mosaic browsers, except perhaps Mosaic 1.0, which does not support HTML forms. (For Mosaic, there is a fallback writing mode, of the form http://example.com/your+message+here)* There is also a cookie-based authentication system, in which the user asks for a new ID, and the server sets cookies for user id and checksum. The checksum is checked against a server secret via hashing, so no storage of account data is needed on the server. This works with all cookie-supporting browsers.* The other authentication system is based on PGP, and allows the user to either use in-browser PGP (insecure) or client-based PGP (less insecure) to sign their messages. These messages can be both client verified and grouped together into a profile on the server.&#34;,
 &#39;If I use a an external framework or library to let me users login via Google or say outlook, do I need to have my own outlook or Google account? Do I need some authorization to do this if say my company uses outlook for their emails and I want to let my co-workers use their account info to sign in through outlook?&#39;,
 &#39;Django user authentication:https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/topics/auth/&#39;,
 &#34;Does anyone know if there&#39;s a decent, comprehensive library that handles all authentication / login for .Net Core apps? Bonus points if there&#39;s a SSO addition (even if that part is commercial).&#34;,
 &#39;Rails + devise even if my application is in another language than Ruby. Laravel could also do the job. Every time I have looked, authentication tools in Javascript are paid or overengineered.&#39;,
 &#39;Keycloak. Open source IDP.&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;ve been eyeing Firebase authentication for a Django project of mine, but haven&#39;t implemented it yet. Can anyone recommend it or advise against it?&#34;,
 &#39;In .net world aspnet identity give you a basic login, can add social logins and identity server adds auth2  support. Both highly customizable&#39;,
 &#39;For user authentication:  Hosted (Auth0 or Okta), self-hosted: HydraFor Service Identity:  SPIRE/SPIFFE... (or Oauth CC flow if mTLS is not possible)&#39;,
 &#39;keycloak is really awesome. This also makes sure when you move to any other oAuth2 authentication, we can simply switch the server details.On the other hand firebase authentication is very scalable easy to set up and start.Dont write it from scratch, if you are in JVM, Spring Security provides a robust implementation, we can just plug, configure and play&#39;,
 &#39;Spring Security for the logic and password storage. I usually build my own pages for password resets and logins&#39;,
 &#39;In my services, I use a combination of:- hashed password or webauthn token\n- palm vein or usb token or (less preferred, SMS)&#39;,
 &#34;we&#39;ve been plugging away at writing an open-source OAuth2 server: https://github.com/curveball/a12n-server&#34;,
 &#39;Keycloak&#39;,
 &#34;One very important aspect of authentication is session management. Doing this wrong (or naively), can have catastrophic effects for your app!!Let me provide an example: It&#39;s common knowledge that JWTs are very common. A lot of people who use JWTs, implement them as access tokens for their APIs. JWTs also require a shared secret key - what if this is stolen? Then an attacker can use that to hijack any user&#39;s account very trivially, and you may not even realise that it&#39;s happened! This is far worse than anyone getting hold of hashed passwords from your database.That being said, I use the following flow for session management:\n- User logs in, the backend issues a short-lived (~1 hour) JWT and a long-lived refresh token and sends them to the frontend.\n- The frontend sends the JWT for each API call while it&#39;s still valid\n- In the event that the JWT has expired, the frontend should then use the refresh token to get a new JWT AND a new refresh token (rotating refresh token - see https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-10.4)\n- If the refresh token expires, then the user has to login again.While this sounds quite straightforward, the key here is to use rotating refresh tokens - that&#39;s what actually makes it fare more secure than just using simple refresh tokens (i&#39;d argue that it&#39;s almost the same level of security as just using a long lived access token)Some of the benefits of this approach:\n- You can detect token theft! If an attacker gets hold of the refresh / access token, because they keep changing, you can detect if an old token is used which is a strong singal of theft (see the RFC link above)\n- You can change the JWT secret key without logging any users out: Once you change the key, all JWTs are instantly invalidated. But then your frontend client can simply use its refresh token to get a new access token signed with the new signing key (along with a new refresh token).\n- Allow your users to be logged in for however long you want without compromising security.Some implementation gotchas:\n- When changing the refresh token, be sure to not invalidate the older token unless your backend is sure that the frontend has received the new token. This can be confirmed by the frontend using the new access / refresh token. This is important since if not done, and if the user is in a bad networked area, it can lead to them being logged out.\n- See this blog and specifically this race condition: https://medium.com/hackernoon/the-best-way-to-securely-manag...If you do not want to implement this on your own, you can also check out https://supertokens.io - It provides an end-to-end implementation of the above taking care of all race conditions and network failure issues. It also prevents other common web attacks which are on the OWASP top 10 list.-----------------------In terms of user authentication for the login part, I prefer using a no-password method - email or SMS OTP. The reason for this is that I do not have to care about managing user passwords (though that&#39;s not too difficult), I do not have to build forgot password flows, and most importantly, users don&#39;t have to remember yet another password.I also only allow 3 attempts for OTPs per OTP. So after sending the OTP, if a user fails to input the correct one 3 times, then I revoke the old OTP and send a new one (this is so that someone can&#39;t simply brute force their way into an account). If the user login is successful, then I revoke all OTPs for that user. If the user clicks on sending the OTP again, then I send a different OTP (but the old one is still valid). This allows me to have a an OTP timeout of say 1 hour - which is more than enough!According to me, this coupled with the above session management flow, is perfect!&#34;,
 &#39;Another thing to bare in mind, for those who are rolling their own, is how you caress those passwords from the DB.The common approach is a simple DB SQL select. But that then means if your web server gets exploited an attacker can dump the entire password database.The safer option is to write a stored procedures to return or modify that table and set permissions on that table so even your web app creds can\x92t directly query the password table. Then your web service only has access to check a single password, rather than downloading every hash on the DB.If you can also offload the encryption/decryption and hashing then that is another step forward too.&#39;,
 &#39;I won\&#39;t buy another iPad, because my perfectly good iPad has essentially died from being cut off from most of the services it needs to run.  Apps have been &#34;updated&#34; to versions that won\&#39;t work, and the ability to download older versions is sketchy at best.  Most recently, I discovered that my magazine access has stopped working, so not only did I stop getting new issues, I can\&#39;t download older content that wasn\&#39;t on my iPad when they killed it.  Discontinuing system software updates was bad enough, but actively killing off the functions it needs to keep operating at the old level is too much for me.&#39;,
 &#39;I have met the writer and he is a nice fella but he is so preposterously missing any kind of substance in this article. A lot of great Apple technology has the ability to get out of your way and I often feel that people are being angry on principle. Making things maintainable or serviceable is a design requirement from the get-go, with all kinds of trade-offs and compromises that are endlessly speculated about on the web. But some people seem to think these trade-offs don\x92t exist. Hypercard? Great at the time. How much did a Mac cost to run it though? Anyway, this article is poorly thought-out and badly-written on top, with absolutely nothing to offer that you didn\x92t already know.&#39;,
 &#34;While I don&#39;t share the sentiment, I get the refusal to participate in the Apple App Store ecosystem. It&#39;s clear what the ideological issue there is.But I do not at all understand the enmity some nerds have for non-replaceable batteries. Over the last 10 years it seems like Apple has run an experiment on whether batteries work better when they&#39;re tightly integrated and not replaceable, and that the results are demonstrably in. The performance I get from non-replaceable batteries has been so much better that I would automatically be suspicious of any device that had replaceable batteries. Meanwhile, if I really want to carry a spare battery with me, I still can; it just takes the form of a USB charger.&#34;,
 &#39;The iPad is a great form factor. I prefer sitting back with it over a computer.10 years later I only wish Google or Microsoft had a stronger competitor. Apple has dragged their feet in making it more useful.Apple\x92s Pencil is great but user input could be enhanced with something like Soli, for example:https://atap.google.com/soli/Slide a wireless keyboard and mouse next to a tablet and it should become my desktop computer.&#39;,
 &#34;My only observation is this: Not everything is about that one gadget you bought.Yeah, I have an iPad. An iPhone. An Apple Watch. No, I can&#39;t mod these things, take them apart, etc. No, I don&#39;t care. I still have a self-built PC running Linux and a bunch of services. I still have a Macbook I can install whatever I want, even Windows or Linux if I chose to. I still have all my own networking hardware that&#39;s substantially more hackable.Going wider, I have a car and I have a bike. One is more hackable than the other. One of them has a service light you need to go to the dealer to clear (unless you&#39;re in the know and have special tools). Some of that is in my wheelhouse, some isn&#39;t. Sometimes I pick a battle, sometimes I let a tool be a tool.I think the world of computing is too wide to bother with puritanical about the devices I use. It&#39;s just not worth the energy when those things that are heretically &#39;infantilizing&#39; etc. are just useful and pleasureful to use.&#34;,
 &#39;I get the ideological issues with the iOS software &#34;walled garden&#34;, but the shitshow that is the only alternative (Android) leaves me wanting.  It\&#39;s malware and advertising infested and Android tablets are a joke and rarely supported for more than 2 years.He complained about third party apps and then goes into a couple of nostalgia trips over the comic book store (I miss it and the music store, too) and taking apart much simpler electronics as a kid.  Like, get your kid a regular PC case, then? What\&#39;s there to even hack?  The iPad, and almost every cell phone as well, is essentially a giant system on a chip with a screen and a battery.  There\&#39;s not much to hack.  Also, most people keep thier iPads for more than two years unless it actually hard-fails.  My last one was 5 years before I finally got a new one (though I also had the misfortune of buying the first one and the first retina one, which didn\&#39;t hold up to the march of new models very well).I don\&#39;t need a hackable portable computer.  I have a full time job and a toddler.  I want to turn it on at the end of the day and look at stupid cat videos. Doctorow reminds me of the people that refused to get cell phones and then complained that their friends stopped contacting them.Also, what the hell is a &#34;CD-ROM programmer&#34;?  Does he just mean software that was distributed on CD-ROM?Also, if he theoretically had &#34;a lot&#34; of AOL shares he\&#39;d have been &#34;bailed out&#34; by the merger with Time Warner and would have had &#34;a lot&#34; of shares in the successor companies (he wouldn\&#39;t be laughing, but he\&#39;d have something), but the fact that he\&#39;s still using AOL as a slur is showing just how much he hasn\&#39;t moved on with the times, even in 2010.The only real criticism I have of the ipad is its annoyingly bad background support.  I still IRC and the clients disconnect very quickly if I switch apps.  This makes SSH annoying as well.&#39;,
 &#34;Fundamentally I think the big difference between 2010 and now is not the continued rise of Apple&#39;s walled garden--which was the focus in 2010--but the steady decline of the state of the web.Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc. today dominate the web and exercise at least the same level of gatekeeping over your visibility to customers as Apple does with their app store. Back in 2010 you could build a Facebook page for your business, and post messages that your fans would see. Can&#39;t do that anymore; buy some FB ads please. Google&#39;s search results quality continues to decline, and their ads continue to be harder and harder to distinguish. And if you anger them, you might just disappear from their service.2010 was also before Snowden, before general awareness of the data collected by social apps, before Cambridge Analytica, before a thousand data breaches. Privacy is more important to people now, and one thing about walled gardens is that they are more private... that&#39;s why the original physical walled gardens were built.It&#39;s not that walled gardens are ideal; it&#39;s that everything has a trade-off, and those trade-offs look different in 2020 than they did in 2010.A lot of this is not specifically about the iPad, and in retrospect maybe the most obvious reaction to this piece is to laugh at the idea that the iPad was some important place to draw a line. Tablets are still great--and used by a lot of poeple--but they ended up being kind of a side story. The iPhone was the real turning point. Not just for Apple, but for many industries.&#34;,
 &#39;There\&#39;s a lot to be said for making a computer my mother can/wants to use. And Doctorow\&#39;s sneering condemnation of people describing their mother\&#39;s as &#34;not good with computers&#34; is telling of what he thinks of those not firmly in the technorati circles he inhabits. Saying &#34;not good with computers&#34; != &#34;a low opinion of that person&#34;. He\&#39;s projecting.My wife and mother are largely mystified by computers and have been brought to literal tears born of frustration when using them. One of these women is a PHD in English literature and has published over 20 books ranging from short stories for children to graduate-level textbooks. The other has a Doctorate of Dental Surgery and is clinical faculty at a respected School of Dentistry.These women aren\&#39;t dumb, but they don\&#39;t give two flying fucks about a computer they lets them unscrew the casing or comes with the schematics of the circuitboards included! They\&#39;re much more interested in exploring the human condition through language or practicing medicine. Between all of that they do need to check their email, shop, and keep up with their family on Facebook.So Cory Doctorow won\&#39;t buy an iPad. It\&#39;s not for him/me/us/the nerds. We can buy raspberry pi\&#39;s, Android devices, Linux desktops, etc... But there is a whole market of people who don\&#39;t care about computers beyond what they can do for them in the most expeditious way possible. I\&#39;m not into toasters, but I use one almost every day and I don\&#39;t care at all how/why it works. I\&#39;ve got bigger fish to fry.This article is framed as a victory lap, but comes off more like a gear-head complaining about how shitty the Ford Escape is. Except that Ford doesn\&#39;t care, because he wasn\&#39;t on their radar when they made it. The people buying Escapes don\&#39;t care, because they\&#39;re busy with all the parts of their lives have literally nothing to do with cars.I\&#39;m sure Doctorow\&#39;s echo chamber will congratulate on sticking it to Apple (again!) with this trailblazing though-piece. And in 10 years we\&#39;ll get another article about how he\&#39;s still not buying iPads. It\&#39;s all very boring to me.&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;d love to buy a non-locked down tablet. There are a lot of things I kind of half-ass do on my iPad (which is my primary mobile device), but which due to iOS restrictions don&#39;t work very well. For instance, SSH&#39;ing into a machine from it, and then having to check a website. The SSH connection gets closed in 30 seconds. Or, you know, running a JIT language right on the machine.The problem is nobody makes a tablet that works better than the iPad for the things I use the iPad for 90% of the time - which is reading, surfing, checking email, and editing photos.I tried transitioning to a Linux laptop last year. That experiment lasted 3 months. It just didn&#39;t fit into a corporate computing environment that is really only set up to support Windows machines. The iPad does fit.Back in the day, when asked about how Apple was going to deal with music piracy, Steve Jobs said they were going to out-compete it. And they did. And that&#39;s really the only way they could have succeeded. Jobs had it right. Similarly, if you want FOSS principles to rule in the mobile space, you have to come out with a product that works as well as or better than the non-open ones.&#34;,
 &#34;My 1st gen ipad is still alive and ticking but completely worthless. Hardly a scratch in the case or screen and the battery is fine. I don&#39;t use it because no modern apps work on it.I bought a 2018 model and what a piece of crap. Warped like a Pringle chip, screen shattered and cracked if you looked at it wrong.&#34;,
 &#34;I got six years of updates for my iPad Air, and it still works fine, albeit a little slowly and some apps are crashy now.  It&#39;s hardly e-waste after 1-2 years.There&#39;s a perfectly adequate online guide for replacing the battery yourself:  https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/iPad+Air+Wi-Fi+Battery+Replacem...  Or you can pay Apple or any competent repair shop to do it for you.  I haven&#39;t yet needed to replace my battery, even after six years.There&#39;s plenty of programming environments for the iPad, including a web browser to run all the awesome web software out there.Did it come with a BASIC interpreter preinstalled?  No, but I&#39;m OK with that.&#34;,
 &#34;&gt; The iPad you buy today will be e-waste in a year or two (less, if you decide not to pay to have the battery changed for you). The real issue isn&#39;t the capabilities of the piece of plastic you unwrap today, but the technical and social infrastructure that accompanies it.The duration stated is nonsense for two reasons:Hardware support: The battery in an iOS device should last at least four years. My father&#39;s is going on seven years under light usage conditions. If the battery fails within a single year, it&#39;s defective and the included warranty covers replacement.Software support: Apple has historically provided software support for old iPads for 5.5 to 6 years. That&#39;s longer than the support duration for many Android devices, or even some cheap Windows laptops.&#34;,
 &#39;i wont buy another one because i locked myself out of my icloud and despite my ipad working fine i reset it to give to my daughter. except now it wont work without the icloud account. i went to the apple store with the device itself, and as much proof as i could muster that the original icloud email i used no longer exists.. and they kindly offered to recycle my old one (old meaning less than a year, its 128gb) and sell me a new one.never again.&#39;,
 &#39;My biggest complaint with any of these mobile devices is that you can\x92t write any software for them, using the device itself. This is regressive and I also think it impedes the growth of technology. Maybe this is what companies like Apple want. Not a much larger pie but the largest portion of a much smaller pie.&#39;,
 &#39;Discussed at the time: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1236722&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;ve seen alot of discontent for his writing style but only a few posts that actually attempt to rebut the fair criticisms that you are being sold a device you don&#39;t control. It&#39;s an interesting hypocracy from a site that hangs on the every word of librem but condones apple in the same day...&#34;,
 &#34;bold to go after apple, but also true. It&#39;s not just infantilization of hardware, but also software, culture and attention. frankly we should be fed up with the lack of any depthIt wasn&#39;t just the ipad, but the damage is already done by phones: entire generations have grown without knowning the real abilities of a computer. the internet has become a photo storage drive. people marvel at their babies knowing how to swipe, and are shocked when they are later baffled by the complexity of computer systems&#34;,
 &#39;Doctorow histrionically copying the entire Gibson quote is a perfect example of why he is a poor writer. He has no sense of balance.&#39;,
 &#39;My iPad air 2 is the daily driver for my family and its still going strong.  This author is complaining they cannot open it and it hurts their feelings???  I wish I was half this privileged to have such small problems.&#39;,
 &#39;It\&#39;s weird to read this article when there are legitimately good programming environments available on the iPad, like Pythonista 3, which is an app that lets you run python on your device.I think the thing that he\&#39;s &#34;standing by&#34; is that he wants to continue making waves by sounding controversial when he has in fact become irrelevant. I like and appreciate the viewpoints of those shared by BoingBoing, but perhaps something less cringeworthy? I understand folks like to build electronics, and there are systems people can build on for 30 dollars. The iPad was always meant to be a computer for someone that didn\&#39;t care to screw with all of the guts of hardware or software. But yes, if you really want to use your iPad to learn about hardware and software, you can certainly do so.And every company has the right to enforce their rules in replacement of defective parts, based upon what prior abuse or misuse you put on it. The average person who &#34;opens&#34; their iPad to fix it deserves to have warranties and guarantees invalidated, even if Apple is a touch predatory in the rates they change for repairs.&#39;,
 &#34;Some weird stuff for him to uncritically \x91stand by\x92:If you want to live in the fair world where you get to keep (or give away) the stuff you buy, the iPad isn&#39;t for you.Seems like this is garbage.If you want to write code for a platform where the only thing that determines whether you&#39;re going to succeed with it is whether your audience loves it, the iPad isn&#39;t for you.This is a weird and naively idealistic statement.  On what platform has this now, or ever been true?  It seems like iOS is at least as close to this ideal if not better than any other platform.I wish we lived in the world he would like us to live in, but he seems to be out of touch with reality.&#34;,
 &#34;A reminder that Nestle got third world women hooked on formula by lying about it and giving away free samples (once you stop breastfeeding your child, you stop producing milk). They did this in poverty stricken countries where mothers didn&#39;t have access to potable water with which to prepare the milk.Millions of babies died from illness and from malnutrition (when the mothers could no longer afford to buy formula) as a direct result of Nestle&#39;s greed.https://www.businessinsider.com/nestles-infant-formula-scand...&#34;,
 &#39;This feels like that time when the Colorado Attorney General sued Boulder County on behalf of the poor, defenseless oil &amp; gas companies.&#39;,
 &#39;Further proof that the US federal government now exists mainly to defend domestic corporate interests.Climate change -- just like the breastfeeding resolution -- is the other example of corporate greed corrupting the government to the detriment of science, the environment and public health.&#39;,
 &#34;&gt; \x93The resolution as originally drafted placed unnecessary hurdles for mothers seeking to provide nutrition to their children,\x94 an H.H.S. spokesman said in an email. \x93We recognize not all women are able to breast-feed for a variety of reasons. These women should have the choice and access to alternatives for the health of their babies, and not be stigmatized for the ways in which they are able to do so.\x94I&#39;m curious what those hurdles were.&#34;,
 &#39;The US opposition to this goes back many years. When WHO adopted the International Code of Marketing Breastmilk Substitutes in 1981. The US cast the only negative vote [1].At least Nestlé and friends have stopped dressing up their salespeople as nurses....[1] https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3371222/&#39;,
 &#39;I don\&#39;t see how the US will get out of the current &#34;corporations run everything of value&#34; situation. Seems like all tools to help fight it are themselves owned by corporations in no hurry to change the status quo.&#39;,
 &#34;Is there a steelman for the opposition to be made? Piling on the shame-bandwagon isn&#39;t expanding the horizons of anyone in this thread.&#34;,
 &#34;I realize this is a problem since time immemorial, but something needs to be done to prevent corporate interests from dictating government and international policies.  I can only call out the problem, I don&#39;t know what the solution is.  But why should people bother to vote if leaders&#39; ignore their constituencies&#39; needs in the face of aggressive corporate lobbying?&#34;,
 &#39;This was news to me, but is dated July 2018.&#39;,
 &#39;(This is from July 2018.)&#39;,

If baby formula companies are any smarter they will probably not waste time and money on WHO resolutions.&#34;,
 &#39;Wait, why is this old article even a thing? It\&#39;s a resolution being drafted by technocrats far away from &#34;real people&#34;.While everyone else here is debating corporate influence, what about the epistemology of the issue itself...why does an inter-governmental organization need such a resolution, and &#34;who the fork cares&#34;?People across the globe know breast feeding works, and they don\&#39;t learn that from the UN or any other government. They learn it from their tribe, family, friends, internet, books. It\&#39;s also intuitively best...AKA its been around for millions of years and we all know that.People should be upset that time and money was spent on this....someone tell me if I missed some vital thing like &#34;non-compliant governments will be replaced by IMF officials&#34;, or &#34;North Korea to ban boobs&#34;?&#39;,
 &#39;I am not convinced that having a vocal blockchain skeptic (Mr Gerard has written the book &#34;Attack of the 50ft blockchain&#34; and has written many articles critical of blockchain and distributed ledger technologies) as an arbiter of Wikipedia pages on cryptocurrencies and blockchain is necessarily a good idea. For example, Mr Gerard will refuse to allow the addition of well-sourced articles on popular projects even though they are reliably sourced in major crypto news publications. As you can imagine, much crypto news doesn\&#39;t reach the mainstream press, so this blocks a lot of useful information appearing on Wikipedia.Also, major projects, such as IOTA, don\&#39;t even have a Wikipedia page or stub, despite the project having a multitude of academic papers and reliably sourced news. Mr Gerard will say this is because of the huge amount of spam on the pages, but other crypto pages, and non-crypto pages, have plenty of spam and they still manage to appear on the site.As an analogy, imagine if climate deniers were in control of Wikipedia\&#39;s climate change pages.Mr Gerard simply has too much influence on Wikipedia\&#39;s crypto pages. There is certainly a crypto spam problem on Wikipedia, but it seems like he is actually censoring information, which for those interested in crypto, is somewhat ironic.&#39;,
 &#39;Imagine having someone that makes money disparaging a particular technology in charge of the &#34;truth&#34; about the technology. I\&#39;ve challenged him to a debate on livestream, which he accepted, and then was never heard from again.&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah, the cryptocurrency spam everywhere is a problem and I\&#39;m glad the community is fighting it. But for me, the more annoying remnant of this bubble is the fact that the meaning of the word &#34;crypto&#34;, used for decades for &#34;cryptography&#34; (like in  &#34;strong crypto&#34;), has now been altered and by default means &#34;cryptocurrency.&#34; Which, because of many crooks involved, is often associated with its shady aspects.&#39;,
 &#39;BTCPay could really use a WP article at this point.&#39;,
 &#39;It\x92s too bad Encyclopedia Dramatica went down. The page on the author of this piece was really something.&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m confused.Can somebody explain who&#39;s more corrupt ... cryptocurrency touts or Wikipedia editors?Talk about the pot calling the kettle black.&#34;,
 &#39;At the current stage of development, ethical AI is on the same level as ethics in the fuel industry, or the food industry, or the finance industry - there are ethical questions there but they concern human ethics in the way the technology is implemented and used.What we don\&#39;t have, or need (yet) is &#34;ethics built into AI algorithms&#34; or &#34;ethics derived from AI&#34; - we just not don\&#39;t have an AI system that\&#39;s advanced enough to require it. Self-driving cars might be the first to raise these kinds of questions, but I would still be reluctant to call that &#34;ethics&#34;.&#39;,
 &#39;True, insofar as there\&#39;s no such thing as an \&#39;ethical human being\&#39;.  And yet, no one would claim that nullifies the pursuit of behaving ethically.In &#34;Life 3.0&#34; and his recent lectures, Max Tegmark repeatedly stresses the pursuit of safe AI requires that we articulate the world we want to live in.In his concluding crie du coeur, Tom Chatfield writes,&gt; give me the capacity to contest passionately the applications and priorities of superhuman systems, and the masters they serveIf Tom or anyone else wants a seat at this table -- to participate in developing and defining ethical AI -- by all means describe the world you want to live in.Until then, it\&#39;s just tantrum-throwing.&#39;,
 &#39;&#34;a form of magical thinking suggesting that the values and purposes of those creating new technologies shouldn\x92t be subject to scrutiny in familiar terms&#34;What parallel universe is this? From the NYT to Medium the entire opinion writing industry seems to run on pieces that scrutinise the ethics of tech.&#39;,
 &#39;There is no such thing as &#34;ethical technology&#34;. A controlled fire can be used to cook food, repel predators, and torture enemies.&#39;,
 &#39;I reckon much of this &#34;Ethical AI&#34; stuff - at least in the context of AGI - has been overly influenced by the idealistic likes of Asimov\&#39;s 3 Laws, which belong to a (at the time) fair vision of a now very outdated understanding of how an intelligent machine-born mind might work.It\&#39;s really important to separate the non-intelligent and over-hyped &#34;AI&#34; tools of today and the near future - which it seems reasonable to expect an ethically guided path and constraints - from the human-sentience AGI equivalents that can only be programmed to be ethical by hypothetical coded laws and &#34;inserting emotion chips&#34; in naive fantasy.&#39;,
 &#39;I would reserve the question of ethical A.I. until we are approaching strong A.I.As of now, where A.I. (specifically ML/DL) is mostly used to solve isolated problems the question of ethics is more about the use of the technology. Technology itself is ethically neutral and the ethical framework is provided by the people that use it (and arguably implement it).I also feel like ethics if A.I. posts/books etc. generally focus too much the bad use case and not enough on the good use case. One can find a lot about the potential issues of autonomous vehicles killing someone in a crash or A.I. surgeons cutting an artery but the other side of the coin is usually under-investigated. How ethical is it to limit autonomous vehicles if they are statistically more safe than human drivers. How ethical is it to put regulations on the use of automated ML in medicine to scan for cancer and require a human to sign off if the human is statistically more likely to make a mistake.Not trying to argue either side but I think the &#34;how ethical is it to not use A.I.&#34; case is under-argued.&#39;,
 &#34;If we create general AI and it ends up valuing personal freedom as much as we do, I suspect it won&#39;t take kindly to attempts to brainwash-by-construction it into acting in ways its creators considered moral. We&#39;re less likely to get a violent AI slave revolt if we respect their freedom of choice.&#34;,
 &#34;Can someone point me towards some good papers on how we actually implement ethical AI? I thought it&#39;d be a fun project, looked for some papers, and just couldn&#39;t find any. Event a 2018 survey just talked about surveys MIT had done for their Moral Machine.&#34;,
 &#39;https://www.britannica.com/story/whats-the-difference-betwee...&#39;,
 &#39;I personally found utilitarianism and kantianism very helpful schools of philosophy to think about the implication of AI. In short, Utilitarianism promotes decisions that benefits the greatest number of people. Whereas, kantianism focuses on the idea that people should be always treated with dignity and respect. Michael Sandel\&#39;s book &#34;Justice&#34; is a great introduction to the topic.\n[1] https://www.amazon.com/Justice-Whats-Right-Thing-Do/dp/03745...&#39;,
 &#34;TL;DR: Ethics is subjective. I&#39;m always surprised that people don&#39;t find that obvious.&#34;,
 &#39;This problem isn\x92t going to go away, largely because there\x92s no such thing as a single set of ethical principles that can be rationally justified in a way that every rational being will agree to. Depending upon your priorities, your ethical views will inevitably be incompatible with those of some other people in a manner no amount of reasoning will resolve. Believers in a strong central state will find little common ground with libertarians; advocates of radical redistribution will never agree with defenders of private property; relativists won\x92t suddenly persuade religious fundamentalists that they\x92re being silly. Who, then, gets to say what an optimal balance between privacy and security looks like \x97 or what\x92s meant by a socially beneficial purpose? And if we can\x92t agree on this among ourselves, how can we teach a machine to embody \x93human\x94 values?&#39;,
 &#34;If people can&#39;t behave ethically, why should technology?&#34;,
 &#39;Ugh I tire of &#34;Ethicists&#34; who cleaely know jack and shit about the field they are rambling on to sell books. The actual ethics for &#34;AI&#34; revolve around application with incomplete understanding just like well everything newly discovered. And how you use it like any tool - if you use AC to electrocute puppies it says more about you then AC power.The penultimate paragraph deserves calling out and outright ridicule.&gt; \x93What,\x94 Morozov asks, \x93drives and shapes all that technology around us?\x94 If we cannot open up such questions for democratic debate, then we risk turning \x93technology\x94 into little more than a \x93euphemism for a class of uber-human technologists and scientists, who, in their spare time, are ostensibly saving the world, mostly by inventing new apps and products.\x94That is a fundamentally stupid statement and Morozov should be deeply ashamed of it. It is the &#34;my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge&#34; writ large. Individual intellectual efforts are not up to democratic debate damn it and it is a good thing. This isn\&#39;t unprecedented - being genocided or pogrummed is also not up for a democratic debate - it is wrong period.&#39;,
 &#39;There is no reason we cannot treat ethics like we do medicine, where prevailing wisdom is arrived at by a methodical and judicious process that is standardized. Sam Harris\&#39;s &#34;The Moral Landscape&#34; is an excellent start for building intuition on how to do this. (https://samharris.org/books/the-moral-landscape/)&#39;,
 &#39;In all irony it will possibly be our quest to impart our understanding of \x93ethics\x94 to the AI which will ultimately lead to making it evil, as very few people seem to understand that ethics is completely flawed because it is culturally biased and requires a great deal of contextual understanding. It\x92s more of a political voodoo than a calculation&#39;,
 &#39;Ethics require an operating model of the world in simulation within the AI, and that operating model needs to include projected hopes and dreams of the beings the AI interacts, as well as a complete operating model of the world the beings exist and the AI. &#34;Ethics&#34; requires general intelligence. Due to artificial general intelligence being potentially out of reach, so too is &#34;ethical software&#34; potentially forever out of reach.&#39;,
 &#39;I misinterpreted the title. Fortinet has removed backdoors from SSH and databases in its product. Granted, I\&#39;m genuinely surprised any security program has this feature:&gt; &#34;FortiSIEM has a hardcoded SSH public key for user \&#39;tunneluser\&#39; which is the same between all installs,&#34; said Andrew Klaus, the security researcher who identified this issue.What other horrible assumptions have been hardcoded into this product that we have yet to discover?&#39;,
 &#39;Bummer. Now it will be slightly harder to block these monstrosities and the idiots who want to buy them.&#39;,
 &#39;They removed a feature.Somebody coded this in, code has been reviewed, managers approved the time spent on this, meetings held, etc.  There is a git commit (or CVS, who knows) with the name and a ticket number.Right now there are probably urgent meetings being held between the interested parties to re-introduce a similar access feature back to the code base, using maybe a password derived from an ip address or serial number.&#39;,
 &#34;Kinda unfortunate that they&#39;re proposing single-rail for everything from now on, you lose some over-current protection when everything is on a single rail with a higher current rating. Thankfully it&#39;s just for prebuilts, so it might not catch on into mainstream DIY PCs.For anyone who doesn&#39;t want to read the official spec, shorting green to black should still turn on the PSU without a motherboard.&#34;,
 &#34;Same goddamn molex... Please, no... I&#39;m sure Molex today has far better designs with much lower insertion force. There should be no reason to stick to old stiff molex.&#34;,
 &#39;Earlier discussion of the same article:https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22151564&#39;,
 &#39;I feel like I\&#39;ve been reading about this tire design for as long as I\&#39;ve been reading about 20xx is the year of the linux desktop&#34;. I expect neither to happen.&#39;,
 &#34;Maybe I&#39;m just a very lucky person, but my wife and I combined have driven probably close to a million miles and I can&#39;t recall having ever changed a tire road side. I can only recall maybe a few punctures ever, fortunately only causing a slow enough leak that it was discovered at home or the destination.Still, with full-size spares having gone the way of the dodo and space-savers better than nothing but not that great, this is a welcome change as long as tire prices don&#39;t become exorbitant.I put a solid rubber tire on my wheelbarrow years ago. It&#39;ll outlast the wheelbarrow. Greatest home garden purchase ever.&#34;,
 &#34;The article mentions ride comfort which is well and good, but what about efficiency?   I don&#39;t see mention of rolling resistance / efficiency, which I understand to be a problem with existing puncture-proof/run-flat tire systems.&#34;,
 &#39;Apologies for a tangential comment, but I laughed at the fact that all of the ads I am shown when viewing this article are for tires.&#39;,
 &#39;tubeless sealants in a tire make sense.non-pneumatic tires are one of those Things that keep coming up and keep being a very stupid idea.&#39;,
 &#34;Can&#39;t see it being adopted widely. Once EV&#39;s become the norm, how else will remnants of auto parts industry parts make money? Asides from brakes and tires.&#34;,
 &#34;&gt; Surely you&#39;ve seen the lightNo? I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever had or see a flat tyre. Seems like the kind of thing that only happens in movies. Doesn&#39;t seem like a problem in practice.&#34;,
 &#39;There have been quite few people boasting about having symptoms and escaping the lock-down.Quite scary given that its a great migration for holidays in China. Imagine being stuck in overcrowded train for hours with a sneezing person.&#39;,

 &#34;I&#39;m patching servers, and the site has such a complex environment that it always takes me a few days to figure out how to run it again. It&#39;ll be back.EDIT: it was never gone, you doofuses are clicking on www.del.icio.us or something. Everybody in this thread owes me a beer.&#34;,
 &#34;While I&#39;m enjoying everyone falling over themselves in this thread the really amusing part is all the people confused this isn&#39;t loading because they use Chrome, which hides the www that shouldn&#39;t be there in the URL.Thanks Google for the entertainment!&#34;,
 &#39;I don\x92t think it should have the www in the url. This url looks different than the submitted one:  https://del.icio.us/&#39;,
 &#34;I was both a fan of del.icio.us (yahoo times) and later pinboard.in, but I&#39;m more and more loosing faith and trust in the guy who operates it. No mobile apps (all third party, relatively unreliable, to one that I&#39;ve used disappeared from the store overnight). Sometimes slow or down and no status page. Twitter account is being used for political messages on US politics (no objection against the expression of opinion - but why can&#39;t he use a personal twitter account instead of mixing it up with his business?). The Chrome addon broke and didn&#39;t get fixed (using an unofficial clone now). At least it&#39;s possible to export the bookmarks as html,xml,json - which I do regularly.(Having said that: I have been a paying customer for years).&#34;,
 &#34;The https address surprisingly isn&#39;t\nhttps://del.icio.us/&#34;,
 &#39;I think this was first of the short URLs that played with words and TLD\x92s that I remember.&#39;,
 &#39;Was it not acquired by the founder of pinboard.in?&#39;,
 &#39;this is really sad :(&#39;,
 &#34;1) Correlation doesn&#39;t mean casuation.2) Twitter is not that popular in Russia/Ukraine at all. If they used social media for military strategy, it was VK and youtube comments, not twitter.&#34;,
 &#39;If Russian strategists were likely considering expansion beyond Crimea, they would have been able to use social media information to assess, with a great deal of precision and in real time, the reception that they would likely receive,\x94 Driscoll and his co-author wrote.Our conjecture is ...Note the speculative angle.  They don\&#39;t offer any evidence that the Russians did any kind of serious analysis of what was on Twitter at the time.  Or whether it influenced their decision making.They only assert that they &#34;may have&#34;.&#39;,
 &#39;If governments use Twitter as another real time source of public opinion data to ensure they only take actions that are popular with people, why is that a bad thing?&#39;,
 &#39;This is completely absurd.&#39;,
 &#39;Hmm. OP, you sort of editorialized a key bit of the source quote:&gt; Compared to other scientists, Nobel laureates are at least twenty-two times more likely to partake as an amateur actor, dancer, magician, or other type of performer.&gt; Nationally recognized scientists are much more likely than other scientists to be musicians, sculptors, painters, printmakers, woodworkers, mechanics, electronics tinkerers, glassblowers, poets, or writers, of both fiction and nonfiction.Nobel Laureates are 22x more likely to be performers of some sort than their peers. Being \x93just\x94 a nationally recognized scientist is associated with being \x93much more likely\x94 to have a music/sculpture/art/tinkering pursuit than other scientists.I don\x92t think this implies \x93have hobbies\x94. But the argument for breadth definitely holds.&#39;,
 &#39;The 22x figure is dubious. I had seen articles citing a more believable 2.85x number. What is not clear to me is what is considered a &#34;scientist&#34; and why is the Nobel Prize used as a metric. For example, what happens if you compare Nobel Prize winners from top universities with the rest of the scientists at those top universities?&#39;,
 &#34;This is a much better article than the title would suggest. If you&#39;re the type that just reads the comments here on HN-- and I&#39;m guilty of this-- I recommend this article.&#34;,
 &#39;Hobbies tend to be pursued by upper class men because they have both the time and money to do so. People eking out a living or doing blue collar work tend to watch TV or similar, too exhausted or too poor to pursue a hobby in their off hours.Women tend to be expected to have interests like cooking. Studies show that people think an expensive Christmas gift for a man should be stuff like a good stereo system while expensive gifts for a woman should be stuff like a refrigerator.(Please, please, do not tell me I have to explain to anyone how a refrigerator is not a personal gift in support of a hobby.)So while the article appears to be written out of a genuine desire to say &#34;Okay. I was wrong. Hobbies are not simply time wasters.&#34; the title used on HN could be roughly translated as &#34;Newsflash: Upper class men still rule the world.&#34;You don\&#39;t say...&#39;,
 &#39;A very similar claim appeared in a BBC article 2 months ago, and it seemed bogus.  After a brief bit of online research, it seems even more bogus to me:https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21617547Please, anyone who wishes to make this claim: give me the name of some Nobel laureate who is also a performing &#34;actor, dancer, [or] magician&#34;.  Even one.&#39;,
 &#39;A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyse a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization is for insects.\x97 Robert Heinlein, Time Enough for Love[1][2]&#39;,
 &#34;Cool!  If I want to get into hobbies, then I should first get a Nobel prize.  This should make it 22 times as likely that I&#39;ll get a hobby.Is there a statistic for someone hoping to go in &#39;the other direction&#39;, i.e. what proportion of hobbyists (vs. non-hobbyists) go on to win a Nobel prize?&#34;,
 &#39;What would Douglas Hofstadter say?&#39;,
 &#34;After reading Rampersad&#39;s biography of Ellison, I feel like I&#39;ll eventually pick the book that this piece reviews.  I&#39;m not sold on the idea that Rampersad&#39;s biography was being wholly unfair to Ellison, at least on the subject of pointing out the gulfs or differences between him and Black writers who rose to acclaim after him.&#34;,
 &#39;What is the basis for these stats? new projects? new repos? new files? new commits? the lack of details makes me wonder.&#39;,
 &#34;Aside from the stats, which are not really surprising, I still find it very hard to get my head around licensing and I bet that this is the main reason why MIT is used. MIT is indeed the only license that is really understandable.The mentioned choosealicense.com is not really helpful with choosing a license because it not really explains all the legal terms used, in my opinion. There are many blog articles out there but to this day I couldn&#39;t find a single overview that describes each of the major licenses in a regular-human way. And this overview is what I would need. Simple language, tailored to the most important questions: copyright, attribution, what can both non-commercial and commercial users do and what not, and what are my rights as the owner.  \nIf you have any resources on this please share it!&#34;,
 &#39;&gt; Changes to licensing in leading open source projects like Mongo DB and Redis are reminders that...That the author should do their homeworks and get the facts right. Redis is BSD licensed for 10 years now. Redis modules by Redis Labs, never a part of the Redis core, changed license.Article flagged because I can excuse a casual commenter here but if you write an article about OSS licensing and are not able to show facts in the correct way, for me there is no place on the HN top positions.&#39;,
 &#39;The thing is, helicopters are different from airplanes. An airplane by its nature wants to fly and, if not interfered with too strongly by unusual events or by a deliberately incompetent pilot, it will fly. A helicopter does not want to fly. It is maintained in the air by a variety of forces and controls working in opposition to each other, and if there is any disturbance in the delicate balance, the helicopter stops flying, immediately and disastrously. There is no such thing as a gliding helicopter.This is why a helicopter pilot is so different a being from an airplane pilot, and why in general, airplane pilots are open, clear-eyed, buoyant extroverts, and helicopter pilots are brooders, introspective anticipators of trouble. They know if anything bad has not happened, it is about to.Harry Reasoner, Approach magazine, November 1973As quoted at https://www.airspacemag.com/flight-today/flights-and-fancy-b...&#39;,
 &#34;Chopper in fs98 was impossibly difficult to fly. I never got it to hover for more than 5 secs. It was like balancing a bead on an inverted bowl. They replaced the bowl with a flat surface in later versions. Don&#39;t know if real ones are just as hard.&#34;,
 &#39;It seems that more special forces get killed in helicopters than in ground combat. The crashes may be due to malfunction, or extremely bad weather, but also because the helicopters are vulnerable to ground fire as they go to reinforce or evacuate men from combat.US SEALS in Afghanistan:https://www.history.com/news/the-costliest-day-in-seal-team-...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Takur_Ghar (Roberts Ridge)https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Red_WingsBritish SAS/SBS in Iraq, Afghanistan and the Falklands War:https://www.thesun.co.uk/archives/news/775565/harrys-five-sa...https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/defence/6044194/Two-...https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-454382/For-time-25-...Coalition forces in Iraq:https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/helicop...https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/mar/21/iraq.ukhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005_Al-Anbar_CH-53E_crashhttps://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/03/16/594168056...Australian SAS in training:https://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-06-11/survivor-remembers-19...One famous example from the Falklands War, where two helicopters crashed in a blizzard on a glacier, but was redeemed by a tremendous feat of airmanship by the pilot of the third helicopter:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Paraquet#Reconnaissa...&#39;,

 &#34;What&#39;s it say about a talented engineer who can&#39;t stay put?Swift languishes without someone to firmly shove it towards crossplatform progress, and the rest of the Apple ecosystem doesn&#39;t exactly inspire confidence either.

 &#34;Modern heraldry, innit? Just like the antique sort with shields and banners, talking about it seems to breed this odd language that&#39;s unrelated to the rest of the world, and yet not totally nonsensical.I&#39;m sure many of the principles translate directly.&#34;,
 &#34;I sort of agree with this, at least from the standpoint it makes it easier to view content, why I added a lot of color formatting to my pages over at stewalexander.comThe data doesn&#39;t need it, but I find it makes it more presentable&#34;,

 &#34;Isn&#39;t this a solved issue, dead horse, decided discussion, etc.? This comes up on every paywalled article.These sites sometimes have interesting content so we allow them to be posted. Some great pieces are written by very established news papers with skilled career journalists. Many members pay for these sites, others often post workarounds. Why automatically ignore all the paywalled sites that may in fact contain high quality content? If such articles are so truly unpopular then they won&#39;t make frontpage, can&#39;t that filter be sufficient enough?&#34;,
 &#39;I build a FF add-on for my self that applies CSS styles to elements with text or attribute values matching a regular expression to solve exactly this issue, for exactly these sites, plus a bunch more. My HN looks like this [1] and, no matter where I go on the internet, links to those sites are never even given a chance to lure me in.[1] https://i.imgur.com/Xo4k5Sj.png&#39;,
 &#34;You&#39;re not the only one. I always check the article source. I never click on Medium or WP, although I can read NYT using my wife&#39;s subscription.\nThere&#39;s others too, sites are getting more aggressive about demanding money. As far as I&#39;m concerned, there are very few sites I&#39;m willng to subscribe to.&#34;,
 &#34;I subscribed to NYT based on the number of interesting articles that get posted here and their consistently high quality.I won&#39;t subscribe to Medium because the quality is very spotty, but I don&#39;t mind stories getting linked here. I can check the link first, and it doesn&#39;t ruin my day when I hit my Medium limit. If they don&#39;t want me seeing their content I&#39;m happy not to waste my time on their site.&#34;,
 &#34;I have a WaPo account, started paying for their journalism in 2016. But I typically don&#39;t click Medium or NYT links. I&#39;ll click NYT links more than Medium because they&#39;re generally higher quality.&#34;,
 &#39;I use temporary containers in firefox. I also have gripe that most of the articles in Medium are non-archivable so I have no way of knowing if the articles I find useful will be available next year.&#39;,
 &#39;I\&#39;ve gotten around this by disabling cookies and javascript on a per site basis.These sites require blocking both javascript and cookies: \nNYT, Washington Post, MIT Technology Review, Wired, National Geographic and LA TimesThese sites require only blocking cookies:\nMedium, Scientific American, Quartz, The Atlantic, Bloomberg and Harvard Business ReviewThe one downside is when the linked article is an &#34;interactive feature/story&#34; and it\&#39;s a site which requires blocking javascript. It\&#39;s an annoyance to temporarily allow such an article\&#39;s source, but I\&#39;d rather have to deal with that than reaching their &#34;free limit&#34;.I\&#39;d much prefer if submitters choose more user-respecting sources, but until then I refuse to feel guilty over stopping these intrusive sites and their dark patterns.The only source I wish was permanently banned is Financial Times -- every article is paywalled and provides no snippet.&#39;,
 &#39;That or there need to be a way to filter sources, being able to read the article can prevent a good discussion.&#39;,
 &#39;f12 - Application tab - clear site data. Enjoy article. \nWorks for NYT, Medium, WP, not sure about WSJ.&#39;,
 &#39;I like free stuff too, but I like ad-free experiences even more. I feel I have to support an imperfect alternative, rather than let everything become ad financed. That said, I am unwilling - and frankly unable - to subscribe to every media that occasionally posts quality content. So, for soft paywalls I occasionally use outline.com, and hard paywalls I just ignore.Maybe there is a business in creating groupbuys for subs. A humblebundle for subscribtion media.&#39;,

 &#39;&#34;... a 26 December 2019 ruling by the Constitutional Court of Turkey that the more than two and a half year block imposed by the Turkish government was unconstitutional.&#34;Your takeaways:1) Turkey has a Constitutional Court.2) Turkey has a constitution.3) The court makes rulings and they are carried out.4) Erdogan did something and it was &#34;checked&#34; and &#34;balanced.&#34;Sounds an awful lot like a nation of laws, ruled by principles and such. Courts always take a while to catch up, just like e.g. investigations and pretty much every process governed by facts. But yeah, cause for some optimism. Lot of yelling here today about the block - guys it was lifted. After a ruling by a court.&#39;,
 &#34;Turkey is an interesting country to deal with. For example let&#39;s say you are a hosting company in the US and one of your customers is rebroadcasting Turkey television. A turkey govt agency would reach out to you and ask that you terminate that customer. If you refused, they go to the domestic incumbent Telecom (Turk Telecom) and null route your entire company ip addr space. Basically all of turkey won&#39;t be able to hit any of your customers. Know a few small hosting shops this happened to and saw the emails.&#34;,
 &#39;I always wonder what the real effects of these kind of blocks.For even average users of the internet, it was easy to overcome this block by just putting a &#34;0&#34; in front of the domain name. 0wikipedia.org is a clone of wikipedia and it was accessible.WHOIS search shows 0wikipedia domain name was created on 4 May 2017, just five days after the block.I am a Turkish grad student in the US. Whenever I visited Turkey, I would get surprised by the error page, remember that it was blocked and overcome it by just putting a &#34;0&#34; in the domain name.&#39;,
 &#34;Don&#39;t expect it to last for long. As soon as something negative about Erdogan gets posted a loophole will be found and will be banned again. Unfortunately the situation in Turkey is not simple, there&#39;s potentially innocent people still in prison since the failed coup attempt, Wikipedia is a small inconvenience compared to prosecution of innocents.&#34;,
 &#34;While talking about this, I think it&#39;s appropriate to at least mention what that block was about: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berat_Albayrak&#34;,
 &#34;I wonder what will happen (politically) in countries that engage in mass Internet censorship when SpaceX&#39;s Starlink constellation goes GA. I&#39;ve always believed (perhaps naively) that the Internet is a great equalizer for information. Free (as in freedom) and unfettered Internet access seems like one of the few things that could make it incredible difficult for bad and oppressive regimes to operate anywhere in the world.If I were a billionaire philanthropist I would try and find ways to get as much Internet connectivity into the hands of impoverished people.&#34;,
 &#39;This latest development follows a 26 December 2019 ruling by the Constitutional Court of Turkey that the more than two and a half year block imposed by the Turkish government was unconstitutional. Earlier today, the Turkish Constitutional Court made the full text of that ruling available to the public, and shortly after, we received reports that access was restored to Wikipedia.&#39;,
 &#39;Wikipedia is down for me today, as well as a large part of Europe.Their tweet: https://twitter.com/Wikipedia/status/1221513346781982722Could it be the Turkish regime DDoS-ing their servers?&#39;,
 &#34;This is awesome. I think that edrogan really made a mistake, but I&#39;m glad that they&#39;re going back and making things better.When I went to turkey, I was really sad that I couldn&#39;t wiki all the cool artifacts that I was seeing. So, I installed a vpn on kubernetes so that really likes VPN. Also, that enabled me to read about the stoic philosopher the roman guy emperorr. It was really cool!&#34;,
 &#34;without wiki i don&#39;t know how i would have solved my problem sets in grad school. let&#39;s see how the academic performance improves in turkey.&#34;,
 &#39;I wonder if Wikipedia currently being down has anything to do with access being restored&#39;,
 &#39;I couldn\x92t believe I couldn\x92t access Wikipedia when I was in Turkey.  If Wikipedia is blocked, how many other sites are blocked?&#39;,
 &#39;well done Turkey, yet the FSF and Debian are still censoring things, what is worse?https://debian.community/debconf20-palestine-messages-censor...&#39;,
 &#39;Any government that suppresses the internet like this deserves to be overthrown.&#39;,
 &#39;Fully?&#39;,
 &#39;lalala&#39;,
 &#39;Looking at you China&#39;,
 &#39;&gt; Access to Wikipedia restored in Turkey after more than two and a half yearsinteresting...&#39;,
 &#34;What about here in the US?  Wikipedia is blocking my access to their website on my iPad because I&#39;m too poor to afford a new one:https://mailman.nanog.org/pipermail/nanog/2019-December/1050...Any news stories about such development?  Or do they only care about Turkey?&#34;,
 &#39;The people of Turkey have voted for him right? He improved their economic situation enormously, this is democracy, you get who you vote for.&#39;,
 &#39;If you are interested in the code behind bitmaps / pixel sprites that scale, pan, and zoom, I\&#39;d like to offer up OpenTTD.https://www.openttd.org/Specifically, Viewports, Blitter and Resize handling:Viewport: https://github.com/OpenTTD/OpenTTD/blob/1.9.3/src/viewport.c...Window resizing: https://github.com/OpenTTD/OpenTTD/blob/1.9.3/src/video/sdl_...Zoom: https://github.com/OpenTTD/OpenTTD/blob/1.9.3/src/main_gui.c...OpenTTD is interesting because it can have multiple &#34;cameras&#34; following objects on the screen. e.g. a viewport can be opened to follow a bus or train, zoomed in, while the main viewport is zoomed out.Also I\&#39;d like to recommend aseprite (https://www.aseprite.org/), which has even cleaner code with zoom / panning / etc. The GUI itself is also pixel art: https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite/blob/v1.2.16.3/src/rend..., https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite/blob/v1.2.16.3/src/app/..., https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite/blob/v1.2.16.3/src/ui/v...&#39;,
 &#34;For anyone else who can&#39;t see it, the Zeus demo everyone&#39;s talking about is here:https://essenmitsosse.de/pixel/?showcase=true&amp;slide=4&#34;,
 &#34;I love pixel art in general but the Zeus one, in particular, is amazing. I think it&#39;s only on that one that I realized just how much these change in response to movement.Don&#39;t know much about it but this surely takes a lot of work? Does every instance of movement have to be accounted for separately or would this reuse some variations?&#34;,
 &#39;Previously discussed (2016): https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11253649&#39;,
 &#39;This is brilliant. I particularly like Zeus.&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m not sure whats going on here but I&#39;m just seeing a picture of 3 nude elderly people fighting over a loaf of bread. It doesnt really seem responsive beyond stretching to fill the screen.&#34;,
 &#39;I wonder if you can make the same demo with real images using seam carving.See the example images in wiki: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seam_carvingOr online demo: https://alexander.soto.io/seam-carving&#39;,
 &#39;So, a phase diagram of Zeus can be built.&#39;,
 &#39;Zeus, Tantalos and Teiresias are so good!Teiresias jumps over the snake when resized like a vertical screen&#39;,
 &#39;Really nice!It reminds me somehow of work from Dirk Koy: https://twitter.com/DirkKoy&#39;,
 &#39;Zeus is amazing, and the brothers one is pretty impressive! Interesting to play around with different sizes at the transition points!&#39;,
 &#39;This is blowing my mind.&#39;,
 &#39;This is awesome, especially the Zeus one!&#39;,
 &#39;OT. For responsive graphic the css media query work very well on SVG.  Can do lots of tricks with it.&#39;,
 &#39;Zeus was such a joy&#39;,
 &#39;Sort of like auto layouts in iOS&#39;,
 &#39;I felt the same way looking at your commit history.&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m amazed by the amount of free time some people have.Don&#39;t get me wrong, it is very nice :)&#34;,
 &#39;Just post the actual results: https://news.gallup.com/poll/284009/library-visits-outpaced-...Also, the results don\&#39;t show at all that &#34;more Americans went to the library than to the movies&#34; but rather that Americans went more to the library than to the movies (on average), which is  not very surprising given that only one of them is free.In other words, if 100 Americans went to the movies once, and 1 American went to the library 101 times, the results would still rank libraries higher than movies despite  it being obviously not true that &#34;more Americans went to the library than to the  movies.&#34;&#39;,
 &#34;Movie going is something that has been on the steady decline for years.  The reality is, people aren&#39;t replacing movie watching with reading, they are just watching movies in a more private setting.  Media consumption is at unprecedented levels today so it&#39;s still dominating our focused time.That said, it&#39;s wonderful that libraries are still relevant and that many people still find them incredibly useful.  The act of going to a library is what&#39;s so amazing... you are actively leaving the comfort of your home and leaving all of the distractions to visit a place that transitions your focus to learning.  Building that habit/ritual for young people is so important because it will build a foundation for a love of learning.&#34;,
 &#39;Our library (Eldersburg branch in carroll county MD) is vibrant!I work from it M-F to get out of the tiny apartment and away from the kids.  The library runs &#34;story times&#34; a couple times a week for the kids.  There is a small kid play area that we frequent during winter or rain when we want to kill an hour.The coolest part is that there is a STEM center with robot, 3d printing, Legos &amp; Julia/Scratch machines.  I also work from the &#34;teen&#34; section (because it allows for talking and I have zoom meetings all day) which has: comics, xbox one, and study rooms available.There are always people tutoring out of the rooms and kids hanging out gaming with switch/xbox fortnite.  It\&#39;s really cool.&#39;,
 &#34;That doesn&#39;t mean Americans watched less movies (maybe even the opposite given Netflix) or that Americans went to the library in 2019 more than they did in 2018. Going to the movies is probably a dying activity, comparing it to going to the library is useless (or even worse: misleading), in that it pushes people to think Americans are reading more by going less to the movies.&#34;,
 &#34;I don&#39;t know if Americans are going to the library more, or shunning movie theaters because of price increases and Hollywood&#39;s creative bankruptcy and a lack of decent films.&#34;,
 &#39;I can totally understand. I want to go to the movies but every time I look at the actual movies they are running it seems they are trying to scare customers away on purpose with bad repertoire.&#39;,
 &#34;I guess I&#39;m one of those frequent visitors to the library, and as strange as it might seem I don&#39;t believe I have been to see a movie at the theater in more than 10 years.&#34;,
 &#39;Regardless of article\x92s accuracy in results, this trend I did not see coming 10 years ago.Given the popularity of ebooks and internet, I thought libraries will slowly go down. This is fantastic!&#39;,
 &#39;This just more of a case of the decline of movies and rise of streaming&#39;,
 &#39;I wonder how much outliers like college students scew the data. I practically live at the library.&#39;,
 &#39;It\&#39;s weird to see going to the library referred to as a social activity. While in many cases it may be a social activity that involves a stay, in most of the cases I observe, it\&#39;s brief and transactional, akin to visiting a convenience store or a short-duration service provider (like a car wash).I went to the library about eight times last year, and in every case I was there solely to use their printer or fax machine (because if you don\&#39;t work in an office, this is about the only place to access these things; certainly the cheapest). While there, most of the people I observed were either doing the same thing, or were stopping in to briefly browse and check out books or media. These aren\&#39;t &#34;social activities&#34; unless buying a pack of gum at the corner store is a social activity. A haircut is far more social for me, and I had more of them last year.My mother takes her great-granddaughter to the library a couple times a month, for various fantastic events the library puts together, which are highly social. They\&#39;re well-attended, so I have no doubt that there are a decent number of people who do legitimately socialize there, but I wouldn\&#39;t count most library visits as social events.&#39;,
 &#34;The ever-powerful pause button is what keeps me from going to move theaters; for many years now. (Also the ridiculous pricing of theaters nowadays, even though i support paying artists for their craft and work.)Stepping back a bit...A few years ago - after we cut the cord on our (stupidly/unnecessarily expensive) cable tv subscription, but before there were several, decent streaming service offerings - my family and i would borrow DVDs from our local library (including an odd book here or there).  It was wonderful!  Sure, sometimes a desired movie would be out/booked by someone else for weeks...But there were always other options, plenty of films to see from classics to more recent stuff. Also, it felt nice to support our local library. After a few years of this of course - when more streaming services beyond only netflix became more prevalent - we stopped leveraging our local library.  The content of these streaming services became compelling enough, and - provided that you don&#39;t over do it with too many services at once - their pricing has been decent enough.  So, for me whether it is borrowing media from our library or subscribing to some decent streaming service, it is the fact that i can enjoy all this content from the comfort of my own home AND pause it (for me to take a food break, bathroom break, etc.) however/whenever i wish is what keeps me away from move theaters.  (Also, the cost has a little impact...but by far and away, it is the pause button that drives my behavior.)In this day and age, I&#39;m wondering if i should cancel 1 or 2 streaming services, and go back to supporting our local library...even if only to help prop up a decent institution for our society?&#34;,
 &#39;That makes me happy. I live in a small town (Sedona Arizona) but we have a fantastic library, probably because we have several billionaires living in the area so there is money for libraries, medical facilities, etc. that is unusual for a small town.I wonder how peoples\x92 perception on the state of the economy affects the library vs. going to the movies decision. For many people in my social circle they are doing better than ever financially and for some, worry about high inflation (currently well over 6%, ignoring the big lie also known as CPI) and reduced social security and Medicare benefits in the future.Libraries are wonderful places to hang out and they are usually free.&#39;,
 &#39;No need to go to the movies when most libraries have a media room with a fat plaque on the wall stating the contract they have with pretty much EVERY movie company, allowing them to screen films to the public.Why pay when I can watch for free at the library?&#39;,
 &#39;Now if only we\x92d fund libraries that way.&#39;,
 &#34;Now that I have children, the library is a regular weekly stop.We&#39;ve only been to one or two movies in the past year. There&#39;s enough on Prime, Netflix, and Disney+ to be honest.&#34;,
 &#34;What&#39;s the criterion to be included in this list? They compare visiting the library to live music, theater, casinos, theme parks or zoos. But all of the other activities demand payment per visit, while going to a library is free, so it&#39;s a bit unfair comparison.I would also compare it to cafes and restaurants, those are also cultural activities. I suspect that then libraries would fall behind.&#34;,
 &#34;I go to the library far more frequently than the movie theater.  There&#39;s just something magical about libraries for me.  So much collected knowledge and creativity, yet unexplored. The smell of old books and the general atmosphere seem to prime me for reading. The fact that I my wife and N kids tag along probably helps the attendance numbers.&#34;,
 &#39;It\x92s a nice place to do remote work on&#39;,
 &#39;I am from the UK. But the last movie I watched in the Cinema was in 2014. It is expensive and unnecessary. I bought in the new year a 60inch 4k HDR TV for less than £400 from toshiba.Why would you bother when you can get a similar experience at home without the hassle?&#39;,
 &#34;Odd that, although they mention it&#39;s an update to a 2001 survey, they don&#39;t link to that 2001 survey to compare.  Were libraries going up since 2001, or were movie theaters going down, or both?  Google is not wanting to show it to me, either.&#34;,
 &#39;Maybe dead malls should be turned into libraries.   Really Big libraries.&#39;,
 &#34;They might have gone to the library, but it probably wasn&#39;t for books.  My local library has a bigger selection of movies (and television shows) than the last time I went to Blockbuster.&#34;,
 &#39;Lots of people doubting the stats here. And while I generally approve the inquisitive nature of HN we maybe should take this time to be optimistic.Good for Americans for breaking stereotypes. Congrats!&#39;,
 &#34;I go to library almost every day - it&#39;s free office space essentially when you&#39;re running a startup, with WiFi and printing.I can&#39;t say the same about movies.Seems like apples to oranges essentially.&#34;,
 &#39;I wonder if people actually opted to a library instead of movie.\nIf so, I wonder what would be the number of people who opted to a library instead of TV/Netflix?&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m curious if this is actually conflating homeless people who spend time in the library as one of their only safe places, rather than actual library patrons.&#34;,
 &#39;Might be related to the rise of Netflix and binge watching, though. Movie-goers go down, the library/movie ration goes up. All is well.&#39;,
 &#39;Are the results segmenting for penniless students who went to the library to study out of &#34;obligation&#34; rather than leisure?&#39;,
 &#39;I\x92d read more into the libraries are more popular than the popular opinion would think  rather than knocking the movies.&#39;,
 &#39;Not going to lie, I definitely pirated a movie or two at the library.&#39;,
 &#39;Should we conclude about libraries or about hollywood output ?&#39;,
 &#39;they are not reading books in the library, they are working on computers or even streaming movies. I am in a library all the time, so this is what I observe.&#39;,
 &#39;Yes, because Netflix.&#39;,
 &#39;&gt; Women Visit Libraries Nearly Twice as Frequently as MenDoesn\&#39;t surprise me. It is pretty hard to &#34;cat call&#34; someone at a library with the whole silence thing.&#39;,
 &#34;how many went to use library broadband to watch videos and movies? that&#39;s what i see all the time.&#34;,
 &#39;in my times, we used to go to the library to read books, wonder if that is still the attraction&#39;,
 &#39;More Americans who answer surveys went to the library than to the movies.&#39;,
 &#39;if you have kids, its an awesome place to go&#39;,
 &#39;Even more watched porn on the internet.&#39;,
 &#39;You have to pay to watch movies at the movie theater. The movies you rent from the library are free. And if your library is part of a network of libraries, then you probably could find any movie you want to watch.Mix that with youtube, netflix, prime, etc, and you really have little incentive and time to go to the theater.&#39;,
 &#39;Url changed from https://lithub.com/in-2019-more-americans-went-to-the-librar..., which points to this.&#39;,
 &#39;If Netflix and piracy make book lovers gloat, so be it!&#39;,
 &#39;Go to the library to borrow movies&#39;,
 &#34;Why is people downvoting me? I don&#39;t think what I wrote deserves downvotes&#34;,
 &#39;...went to the library, to check out a movie?&#39;,
 &#39;Thanks for sharing!&#39;,
 &#39;How many went to watch porn on library computers&#39;,
 &#34;I think a good under-appreciated use case for SQLite is as a build artifact of ETL processes/build processes/data pipelines. Seems like lot of people&#39;s default, understandably, is to use JSON as the output and intermediate results, but if you use SQLite, you&#39;d have all the benefits of SQL (indexes, joins, grouping, ordering, querying logic, and random access) and many of the benefits of JSON files (SQLite DBs are just files that are easy to copy, store, version, etc and don&#39;t require a centralized service).I&#39;m not saying ALWAYS use SQLite for these cases, but in the right scenario it can simplify things significantly.Another similar use case would be AI/ML models that require a bunch of data to operate (e.g. large random forests). If you store that data in Postgres, Mongo or Redis, it becomes hard to ship your model alongside with updated data sets. If you store the data in memory (e.g. if you just serialize your model after training it), it can be too large to fit in memory. SQLite (or other embedded database, like BerkleyDB) can give the best of both worlds-- fast random access, low memory usage, and easy to ship.&#34;,
 &#39;&gt; Of those that are serverless, SQLite is the only one known to this author that allows multiple applications to access the same database at the same time.IIRC, MS Access allowed that, which explained a lot of its popularity.&#39;,
 &#39;&gt;  It is important to understand these two different definitions for &#34;serverless&#34;. When a database claims to be &#34;serverless&#34;, be sure to discern whether they mean &#34;classic serverless&#34; or &#34;neo-serverless&#34;.It\&#39;s really not important to understand that distinction, because this author seems to be the only one making it.  Everyone knows what &#34;serverless&#34; means at this point, and it\&#39;s not an embedded DB.&#39;,
 &#34;In case SQLite is not enough and you need redundant servers or clustering, there&#39;s also database servers that use SQLite as storage engine: http://rqlite.com/ https://dqlite.io/&#34;,
 &#39;It does allow multiple applications to access the same database at the same time, but when you do so it really hurts performance.  I noticed this when i wrote a web crawler in go and used sqlite as the backend.As soon as i connect using the command line interface, it slows down significantly.Just something to bear in mind if you want to use it with multiple processes!&#39;,
 &#39;What I really want: SQLite storage backend driver for s3/gcs. No need for disks then. I haven\x92t been able to find such a solution though; and am not technically proficient enough in C (the Lang SQLite is written in) to do so myself.&#39;,
 &#34;a bit tangential, but when do you move form using in-application data structures (maps, trees, vector/arrays) to using a database? Is it basically when the data doesn&#39;t fit in memory? I&#39;ve been programming for almost a decade and I&#39;ve never come across needing a database... (for context, it&#39;s ten years without anything web related) I&#39;m interested in them and I&#39;d love to learn SQL but I can&#39;t even think of a use case outside of managing user in some web based application&#34;,
 &#39;SQLite is amazingly prevalent as well. Your own phone probably has hundreds of SQLite databases on it. One challenge with SQLite, though, is you have to download the whole thing to make use of it.Shameless plug, but I made a fun side project that allows Amazon Athena to read SQLite databases from S3. https://github.com/dacort/athena-sqlite&#39;,
 &#39;I love SQLite, but people approach it from a classic RDBMS angle which confuses them.Here\&#39;s the deal: SQLite is a file format with a nice API that uses SQL as the paradigm for reading/writing to the file.That\&#39;s it. Stop overthinking it.Can you write a microservice that stores its data in a big JSON file that you\&#39;ve built some code around to read/write to? Yes. It\&#39;s just a file, but you have to build all the read/write methods.  SQLite is not really any different, except the read/write work is already done, and you use SQL to format the data values and encode the read/write logic instead of the language you are working in.The file format has some cool extensions like text indexing, geospatial, etc. But it\&#39;s no more a RDBMS than reading and writing a JSON file is.&#34;But there\&#39;s indexes!&#34; Yes, just liked you might build an index on your JSON file and read that before reading the JSON file to know where things are faster -- and then you have to write all the code to do that. SQLite is just a file format, where you can also build indexes and all the code for that is already done for you.It\&#39;s just a file format with an API that\&#39;s similar to the ones you\&#39;d use for any regular old RDBMS and uses SQL as the domain language to read/write data.It\&#39;s just a file format. Anything you can do/can\&#39;t do with a file format you do with SQLite.It\&#39;s just a file format. A nice convenient one that you are probably better off using than most other things for most purposes.It\&#39;s just a file format.editI\&#39;m glad this comment is getting such a response. I\&#39;m not trying to be mean, just help clarify thinking.Here\&#39;s two thought experiments:1) If SQLite didn\&#39;t require you to use SQL as the read/write logic and was called &#34;datalite&#34;, and instead just forced you to use C function calls, exactly like you would if you were working with literally any other file format on the planet, would you still be confused as to what it is?2) Do you consider reading and writing to any other file format anywhere in the hierarchy of RDBMSs? Consider Python\&#39;s csv module. Is that an RDBMS? Let\&#39;s move away from tabular data, how about python-docx?&#39;,
 &#34;Does this mean that you can hack some database storage (w/ sqlite) together on frontend only hosting platforms like Github or Netlify?I think not, but I wonder if some hack is available by virtue of it simply being a file that you can read (and somehow) write to.The best I came up with: let&#39;s say you have a toy project, and you call the Github API and replace the file upon every write. Implementing a read is easier as you know where the file is located. This hack shows that you somehow need write access to get any form of performance out of it, because this hack is super slow.&#34;,
 &#39;This document is golden, serverless means an application reading and writing to the database in the process directly&#39;,
 &#39;I find this article valuable. I made a mental note to check if SQLite is enough every time I consider one of the \x93serverless\x94 options.&#39;,
 &#34;Choose your own definitions... but SQLite is not serverless by common parlance.Author creates two definitions for serverless which don&#39;t match the common usage. Serverless is more about DevOps / deploy experience than how the program leverages OS processes internally.Apparently MS and AWS are ISPs?Maybe SQLite could be serverless if you defined it as incapable or running as a server on its own?&#34;,
 &#34;I don&#39;t think we fully appreciate just how pervasive SQLite is in our computing devices. Apple recognized its power and utility and embedded it in macOS and iOS, and Google apparently followed suit in Android. The universality of SQLite is due in no small measure to its stellar quality and the trustworthiness of its author, D. Richard Hipp.&#34;,
 &#34;Serverless, like all embedded databases ;-)In the sense you don&#39;t need to provision an additional piece of infrastructure to power your application :-)&#34;,
 &#39;Yep SQLite is in fact serverless. We based our open source web based IDE on SQLite and it works fantastically. The best part is that you can even take a SQLite database and use sql.js and run it offline in the browser!&#39;,
 &#39;&#34;Microsoft Azure Cosmo DB and Amazon S3 are examples of a neo-serverless databases.&#34;Can we back away a bit from the bandwagoning of misused terminology? Serverless literally means &#34;running your apps on somebody else\&#39;s server&#34;. S3 is not a server you run your apps on, it is SaaS that you manipulate through an API - you don\&#39;t put your apps on it. If S3 is serverless, then literally every network service of any kind is serverless.&#39;,
 &#34;The main problem that I see for using sqlite is exactly for it being &#39;Classic Serverless&#39;. Because how does one keep an up te date backup? Deploying to Heroku, Dokku, AWS Lambda and such means the sqlite file will be lost on a crash or new deploy. Even a VM can crash. Export to S3 on every write? Maybe if changes do not happen often, so only for specific use cases (and actually I think you should just generate static html in that case).I use sqlite for local tests for cases where the live app has a &#39;neo-serverless&#39; database. It is very, very fast so the tests run almost instantly.&#34;,
 &#39;I like the definition of classical- and neo- serverless. Does anyone knows more articles about serverless in terms of classical serverless?&#39;,
 &#39;&gt; Neo-Serverless: The database engine runs in a separate namespace from the application, probably on a separate machine, but the database is provided as a turn-key service by the hosting provider, requires no management or administration by the application owners, and is so easy to use that the developers can think of the database as being serverless even if it really does use a server under the covers.I\x92m having a failure of imagination here.What would I use a database for that I could reasonably assert to my peers and superiors that no maintenance whatsoever is required? Backups and restores count as maintenance. Multi region is now common, if not pervasive.Are there public datasets that are so common that it would be worth it to provide it as a service? What other service would behave like S3 but look like SQLite?I get that one might be safe to assume that \x93serverless\x94 isn\x92t just pure functions. It could reach out to other services that are not serverless and still not consume (further) resources on a set of machines while not in use.But a severless database... I\x92d have to have something aggressively read-mostly, written to S3 at intervals and read from serverless processes. But is that a new thing or reading data from S3?&#39;,
 &#39;I integrated my database with the app server, but I still open a socket internally to access it.So my system is also &#34;serverless&#34; in that meaning.Acronyms used to be confusing, this is just ridiculous.http://root.rupy.se&#39;,
 &#39;I use SQLite as a backend for my website and absolutely love it. Not having to setup a full dbms just for a small blog is a dream, and backups are as easy as copying a file.&#39;,
 &#39;CSV is also serverless..&#39;,
 &#39;I currently use it to build a read-only rest service for GeoNames gazetteer.\nEach instance contains a copy of the database which means its really linearly scalable.&#39;,
 &#39;My understanding of serverless = easily scalable, managed service.But somehow the word annoys people. Maybe we should find a better word?&#39;,
 &#39;&#34;There\&#39;s no server process&#34; vs &#34;there\&#39;s no server on your itemised bill&#34;.&#39;,
 &#39;I don\x92t get it, then any db can be classic serverless if they run in the same computer as the app?&#39;,
 &#39;Isn\x92t it easier to say \x93embedded\x94 and \x93severless\x94&#39;,
 &#39;This is not new or unknown information, why is this on the front page?&#39;,
 &#39;I think better name (and coined since 1990ies) is embedded db engine. MySQL, Firebird (InterBase) etc can also be linked into binary and run in the same process, without any type of sockets.&#39;,
 &#34;Two definitions of serverless?I heard many, but what they&#39;re writing isn&#39;t one of them.As far as I can tell SQLite was always called an embedded database, and never a serverless one.&#34;,
 &#39;&gt;  SQLite is an example of a classic serverless database engine. With SQLite, there are no other processes, threads, machines, or other mechanisms (apart from host computer OS and filesystem) to help provide database services or implementation. There really is no server.Well, it\&#39;s bending the overall consensus defining serverless as a managed / and or stateless service.I never saw anyone using the term &#34;serverless&#34; to mean &#34;embeded&#34;.Using this definition, anything and everything that is not requiring a specific server to be served / distributed can be described as serverless.&#39;,
 &#39;Why even write this? It\&#39;s yet another convoluted use of the term and meaningless for SQLite of all things.Re: downvotes - what are people disagreeing with? That the term is not convoluted? That it\&#39;s actually useful? That it helps to have more sub-definitions in an industry known for overloaded terms? I guarantee not a single person here has used &#34;classic serverless&#34; over &#34;in-process&#34; or &#34;embedded&#34; in their entire career.&#39;,
 &#34;I do quite a bit of DOCSIS consulting.There are both technical and business reasons for the gap between upstream and downstream speedsThere are a few  technical reasons. There is less upstream frequency available in the upstream. 42 MHz is the standard upstream/downstream split, 85 MHz is a midsplit, 200 MHz is a high split, and the downstream goes up to 1Ghz or even 1.2Ghz. The upstream modulation runs at 64 QAM (~27Mbs) and downstream modulation runs at 256 QAM (~38 Mbps). The upstream is also more sustainable to interference and impairments. So the technology is inherently imbalanced.From a business prospective it is very difficult to cost justify. Moving the upstream/downstream split and/or upgrading to DOCSIS 3.1 is very expensive. The reality is that the typical customer use very little upstream bandwidth. It isn&#39;t uncommon for me to see a node with 24 or 32 downstream channels at 80% usage and 4 upstream channels are at 25% utilization or less.  We see a downstream to upstream usage ratio of about 15:1.  If you move the US/DS split that means you are taking away from available downstream frequency which means less DS data bandwidth or fewer video channels. It&#39;s hard to make a business case to invest in increasing upstream bandwidth when the data says people aren&#39;t going to use it.Newer technology like DOCSIS 3.1, Docsis FDX, Remote PHY and modern plant designs like N+0 or N+1 (which means fewer customers per node) will bring higher upstream bandwidth, but it will be awhile before we see anything close to symmetrical speeds.&#34;,
 &#39;While I stewed after the dotcom crash during early 2000s, I had a short 2-year gig working as a headend tech for a small cable company.It\x92s not about demand, it\x92s about climbing poles and rolling bucket-truck crews to replace filters and other expensive equipment on a massive scale.The top comment in the link there is spot-on.\nhttps://superuser.com/a/1519918I was involved with the \x93digital switchover\x94, moving the traditional analog channels over to the digital QAM channels, potentially freeing those now duplicated analog channels for upload channels.  Maybe more upload is technically possible but the work on the poles is going to be expensive.[edit] oops, pasted duplicate.&#39;,
 &#34;Fiber can also have asymmetrical speeds (see GPON, NGPON2 etc.).  The issue is not the media per se but the concept of shared media.  Take any media, wireless, coax, fiber, even copper (ADSL) you have X amount of spectrum to work with so you have to decide how allocate said BW. Since most users demand is higher for downstream than upstream (typically you are downloading a lot more than uploading) it makes sense to allocate more to downstream. Of course it is possible to have full duplex symmetrical speeds. Say you want to allocate 2 fibers, on for upstream and one for downstream, then you can have symmetrical speeds. But typically due to costs, you want to have one fiber shared between a large number of users (e.g. GPON or NGPON, aka FiOS) or one coax shared amongst many users, or some set amount of RF spectrum, in any case you need to make the same type of trade off choice that the cable provider makes or that the DSL provider makes or wireless providers. In the case of wireless the reason that uplink is so much weaker is due to the limited power of the user equipment, also smaller antenna etc. refer to Shannon&#39;s law, uplink will be weaker. But generally speaking, it makes sense to have asymmetrical speeds unless you have the luxury of having the same spectrum and power available for both directions.&#34;,
 &#34;I don&#39;t buy the &#39;no demand for it&#39; line. It has never been offered by the big players. They don&#39;t want consumers uploading large amounts of data. I suspect this was originally done due to piracy concerns. But with so many homes having Nest products (and the like) that constantly upload, we need higher uplink speeds.&#34;,
 &#34;Besides this, coax is &#39;half duplex&#39; until you apply Frequency division. Hence every bit of upload costs you bandwidth on the download side.At the same time, fiber is full duplex so this is much less of an issue.The difference is that applying a voltage at the transmission side in coax will be noticed by the receiver, (cause electricity goes both ways) whereas shining a light into fiber doesn&#39;t get to the detector (because light only goes one way). At least, this is my limited understanding. Would love if anyone more knowledgeable could correct me.&#34;,
 &#34;That information is quite outdated. It&#39;s more than possible to get symmetric speed on (EURO)DOCSIS 3.1.  The main reason it does not happen is because there is no consumer demand for it.&#34;,
 &#39;&gt; Cable TV, before DOCSIS cable modem internet service became a thing, didn\&#39;t need much upstream bandwidth.  All the upstream was needed for was to authenticate the cable descrambler set-top boxes, authorize occasional pay-per-view transactions, and maybe do a few minor &#34;interactive TV&#34; things, like letting you check your cable bill from your descrambler box.Cable TV didn\&#39;t have any upstream signaling once upon a time; it was a purely a system of repeating and replicating an analog signal in the downstream direction.Early scrambling methods for &#34;pay TV&#34; channels could be undone using circuits that were published in electronics magazines.&#39;,
 &#39;Because simply US (upstream) frequencies are limited to 42 MHz or 85 MHz. They start at 5 MHz.While in most cases downstream frequencies start from 54 MHz to 1 GHz&#39;,
 &#39;1 gbit non-fiber is all but marketing. For starters they have a small bandwidth caps, which keeps you from doing anything interesting. Another thing like the article mentions is that it\x92s a meager upload ability.I have symmetrical gigabit fiber at my house. When a new Ubuntu torrent drops I\x92m able to seed a TB relatively quickly. Bandwidth caps would make it so much less useful and interesting.&#39;,
 &#34;I don&#39;t think we need symmetrical, but could we get 4:1 ratio instead of  20:1 please?\nPIN fiber that Verizon FiOS uses is 4:1 at the physical layer, or it was with BPON and GPON standards. I did not follow.  I imagine they can sell symmetrical since most people don&#39;t use much upstream.  Oversubscription is standard and works great in almost all cases.&#34;,
 &#34;I think it&#39;s a conspiracy/scam, so they can milk every dollar out of every company that wants to peer with them.The only way to peer for free is if your traffic profile is 50% send and 50% receive.  Cable companies offer these asymmetric pipes to their customers to make this balanced traffic profile impossible to achieve, so everyone ends up paying the cable companies big bucks for transit on their network.&#34;,
 &#34;Because ISPs are cheapskates and don&#39;t want to upgrade their networks and hardware.There are better exceptions, like Altice who are in the process of replacing their coaxial network footprint with fiber optics. Interestingly, according to them it will actually cause them to save money in the long run due to lower maintenance costs for fiber optics.I guess other coaxial ISPs are too greedy for short term profits to look ahead.&#34;,
 &#39;I can about triple my internet bill to double my uplaod speeds and still be about 50% off what I need for things I run at home. Media streaming from my own server is possible for 1-2 people at 720p/mbps and I want that pushed to 1080p minimum. A business class connection might get me there.&#39;,
 &#39;My ISP will not sell me anything better than 1G/100M on fiber. Maybe if I looked into business plans maybe.&#39;,
 &#39;A fiber network Hotwire offers max 1 Gbps download and 50 Mbps upload in South Florida. Oh and it\x92s a 2-year contract if you want those speeds.&#39;,
 &#39;Not mentioned, they don\x92t want to support residential customers serving web sites (or anything else)&#39;,
 &#39;That was an interesting article thanks for sharing.&#39;,
 &#39;Is bandwidth speed?&#39;,
 &#34;Why aren&#39;t electrons photons?&#34;,
 &#39;Direct link to study: https://ehjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12940-...The researchers found the link between living near highways and future neurological disorders to be independent of income, education, ethnicity, comorbidity, and coexisting medical conditions associated with future neurological disorders (traumatic brain injury, diabetes, hypertension, stroke, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, and arrhythmia).&#39;,
 &#39;Anyone living near a busy road is swimming in particulate matter on the micrometre and nanometre scale, and particles on that scale bypass the normal defences, get into the blood stream and saturate the body. Small particles can even move down nerves, it\x92s really not surprising that long term exposure causes neurological problems.&#39;,
 &#34;It is insane that given the destruction that cars cause we don&#39;t do more to reduce their use.&#34;,
 &#39;If there\&#39;s a confirmed link between neurological disorders and air quality and traffic, wouldn\&#39;t this show up in major metropolitan cities as well? Someone who lives near a highway is probably exposed to the same if not more automobile pollutants as someone in a city? I guess I\&#39;m trying to make the point that if the conclusion that they\&#39;re drawing (proximity to cars = neurological disorders) it should show up in contexts outside of just &#34;highways.&#34;&#39;,
 &#39;Once I was talking to a retired real estate agent and they said they had noticed a disproportionate number clients who lived by the highway had lung cancer in their family.&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;ve always been fearful of the life outcomes endured by those raised in the Washington Bridge Apartments (they straddle the trans-Manhattan expressway, sort of like the western end of the Cross Bronx Expressway)https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Washington_Bridge_Ap...https://htcexperiments.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/gissen_ex...&#34;,
 &#34;I live near a four lane road which is quite busy. I&#39;m only about 50m away but there are two blocks of houses between me and lots of trees. The road speed is 60km/h but most vehicles travel 80km/h. I wonder if speed has some effect of whipping up the pollutants more?The road is near the main hospital. My town is not a very big maybe 70,000 total spread out over a large area. But ambulances go by once or twice per hour more frequently in the summer. The noise from them bother me more than fumes although I can&#39;t smell fumes or see nano-scale sized particulates.So if I start to act crazy...well, crazier, here in the comments you&#39;ll all know why. And before I do.&#34;,
 &#39;I wonder if they controlled for... why people choose to live where they live. I.e., this wasn\x92t an RCT; they could just assign people to live near highways or not. So the people who are living near highways are there for a reason.Are residences near highways, perhaps farther from certain other things, like city centres? Such that a certain type of person (people with pre-existing [perhaps subclinical] mental issues of the type that might make them want to avoid people) would be drawn to live in these residences more than others?To me, \x93living near a highway\x94 sounds a lot like a euphemism for \x93living in the middle of nowhere\x94, since by definition all arterial roads connecting \x93somewhere\x94 to \x93somewhere\x94 through \x93nowhere\x94 are highways. If you live somewhere isolated that\x92s accessible at all by road, and you don\x92t have the budget to build your own long stretch of lane out from the highway, then presumably you live on a highway.&#39;,
 &#34;This isn&#39;t a new connection.  A quick web search for example https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6...&#34;,
 &#34;Is it not also likely proximity to green plants reduces stress, and blood pressure? And mood improvement might shave years off exposure of risk to Parkinson&#39;s insidious side effects on mood leading to later or post death (postmortem exam) diagnosis.&#34;,
 &#39;I should probably just read the study but I wonder if it controls for varying levels of income&#39;,
 &#34;With the way the Corona Virus is spreading we might all be wearing Face masks pretty soon.This may seem like common sense after Flint, but at this point I think a home water filter is needed for most parts of the country. Can&#39;t blindly trust the municipalities.A Home Air filter is probably needed too.Here&#39;s a growing list of things Youtube told me things one should invest:1. Home Water Purifier2. Air Filter3. Good Mattress / Pillow4. Blackout Blinds for Windows (sleep)5. Gym Membership6. Standing Desk7. Travel8. Vegan/Plant Based DietOh and Washing Hands regularly.Yeah its a growing list, and getting kind of expensive. I&#39;m surprised how much it starts resembling living in a 4 star hotel.&#34;,
 &#39;I\x92ve been using an air quality monitor and a few HEPA air purifiers around the house for years. It\x92s affordable and effective.&#39;,
 &#39;And Vancouver is notable for its lack of freeways through the city. Just lots of big roads.&#39;,
 &#39;did they control for poverty?&#39;,
 &#39;&gt; Living near a major road or highway was associated with a 14-per-cent risk for dementia, and seven per cent for Parkinson\x92s disease.I love how the article completely misses the important data point: what are the actual risks for other categories not living next to highways? Without this information, an &#34;increased risk&#34; is meaningless speculation.&#39;,
 &#34;There&#39;s been an explosion of new DBs, but I haven&#39;t found anything that really beats Postgres or MariaDB for most workloads. The main advantages of these battle tested DBs is that they&#39;re easy to operate, well understood, full featured, and can handle most workloads.It does make me wonder what will be the next big leap in DB technology. Most of the NoSQL or distributed DB implementations have a bunch of limitations which make them impractical (or not worth the trade offs) for most applications, IMO. Distributed DBs are great until things go wrong, and then you have a nightmare on your hands. It&#39;s a lot easier to optimize simple relational DBs with caching layers, and adding read replicas scales quite effectively too.The only somewhat recent new DB that comes to mind which had a really interesting model was RethinkDB, although it suffered from a variety of issues, including scale problems.Anyway, these days I stick with Postgres for 99% of things, and mix in Redis where needed for key/value stuff.&#34;,
 &#39;Great work and very interesting ideas. I\&#39;m working on a versioned database system[1] which offers similar features and benefits:    - storage engine written from scratch\n    - completely isolated read-only transactions and one read/write transaction concurrently with a single lock to guard the writer. Readers will never be blocked by the single read/write transaction and execute without any latches/locks.\n    - variable sized pages\n    - lightweight buffer management with a &#34;kind of&#34; pointer swizzling\n    - dropping the need for a write ahead log due to atomic switching of an UberPage\n    - rolling merkle hash tree of all nodes built during updates optionally\n    - ID-based diff-algorithm to determine differences between revisions taking the (secure) hashes optionally into account\n    - non-blocking REST-API, which also takes the hashes into account to throw an error if a subtree has been modified in the meantime concurrently during updates\n    - versioning through a huge persistent and durable, variable sized page tree using copy-on-write\n    - storing delta page-fragments using a patented sliding snapshot algorithm\n    - using a special trie, which is especially good for storing records sith numerical dense, monotonically increasing 64 Bit integer IDs. We make heavy use of bit shifting to calculate the path to fetch a record\n    - time or modification counter based auto commit\n    - versioned, user-defined secondary index structures\n    - a versioned path summary\n    - indexing every revision, such that a timestamp is only stored once in a RevisionRootPage. The resources stored in SirixDB are based on a huge, persistent (functional) and durable tree \n    - sophisticated time travel queries\n\nAs I\&#39;m spending a lot of my spare time on the project and would love to spend even more time, give it a try :-)Any help is more than welcome.Kind regards\nJohannes[1] https://sirix.io and https://github.com/sirixdb/sirix&#39;,
 &#39;For some context, this project is from one of the leading research groups in high-performance main-memory OLAP databases. Neumann\x92s 2011 paper, in particular, basically invented the modern push-driven operator-collapsing approach to query compilation.&#39;,
 &#39;This is a tidy and thoughtful database architecture. The capabilities and design are broadly within the spectrum of the mainstream. At this point in database evolution, it is well established that sufficiently modern storage architecture and hardware eliminates most performance advantages of in-memory architectures. However, many details of the design in the papers indicate that this database will not be breaking any records for absolute performance on a given hardware quanta.The most interesting bit is the use of variable size buffers (VSBs). The value of using VSBs is well known -- it improves cache and storage bandwidth efficiency -- but there are also reasons it is rarely seen in real-world architectures, and those issues are not really addressed here that I could find. Database companies have been researching this concept for decades. If one is unwilling to sacrifice absolute performance, and most database companies are not, the use of VSBs creates myriad devilish details and edge cases.There are techniques that achieve high cache and storage bandwidth efficiency without VSBs (or their issues) but they are mostly incompatible with B+Tree style architectures like the above.&#39;,
 &#39;I love seeing this: there are massive opportunities to build fundamentally differently architected database based on evolving computer architectures (ram, persistent ram, GPU, heck - even custom hardware) as well as improved understanding of ACID in distributed environments. \nSQL remains an important API :)&#39;,
 &#34;From the paper.&gt; and subsequently allow the kernel to immediately reuse the associated physical memory. On Linux, this can be achieved by passing the MADV_DONTNEED flag to the the madvise system call.Shouldn&#39;t this be MADV_FREE? This instantly reminded me of this classic Bryan Cantrill talk https://youtu.be/bg6-LVCHmGM?t=3529Edit: It seems that the Linux behavior is relied upon? From later in the paper.&gt; Note that it is even legal for a page to be unloaded while the page con-tent is being read optimistically. This is possible since the virtual memory region reserved for a buffer frame always remains valid (see above), and read accesses to a memory region that was marked with the MADV_DONTNEED flag simply result in zero bytes. No additional physical memory is allocated in this case, as all such accesses are mapped to the same zero page&#34;,
 &#34;&gt; It is a drop-in replacement for PostgreSQL.Well, that&#39;s a bold assumption as pg is speaking one of the richest sql dialects out there. And it also means it supports pg WAL protocol ?The product is backed by solid research, so I suppose that there must be some powerful algorithms built-in, with a good coupling with hardware [1].So the last question is how the code is made and tested, because good algorithms are not enough for a having a solid codebase. pg+(redis/memcached) is battle-tested.Seems to use some common ideas with pg such as query jit compilation but mixes it with another approach.&gt; Umbra provides an efficient approach to user-defined functions.possible in many languages using pg.&gt; Umbra features fully ACID-compliant transaction execution.jepsen test maybe ?Didn&#39;t harvest the clustering part neither.[1] http://cidrdb.org/cidr2020/papers/p29-neumann-cidr20.pdf&#34;,
 &#39;Perhaps I am a bit slow, but could someone else with better understanding ELI5 what benefits this provides over Postgres?I would really appreciate it.The only bit I really understood was:    The system automatically parallelizes user functions\n\nNow granted, I only understand how DBs work from a user-facing side so that might be a barrier here.&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m still surprised that the industry barely knows about ClickHouse.\nVery few times I had the impression the be adopting a game changer technology and that&#39;s the case with ClickHouse. \nWe only currently use it for analytical purposes but it&#39;s been proven that it&#39;s very valid solution for logs storage or as time-series DB.\nI already have in my roadmap to migrate ElasticSearch clusters (for logs) and InfluxDB to ClickHouse.&#34;,
 &#39;Amazing! I wonder if this is going to be acquired in similar way like HyPer. Commercialization of HyPer took a lot of resources, I wonder what state is Umbra in.&#39;,
 &#39;Anyone know of any benchmarks are specific features this has over other DBs?  &#34;Built for in-memory speed&#34; might as well say &#34;web scale.&#34;That browser based query analyzer is cool.&#39;,
 &#34;the innovation has happened at cloud database projects. dynamo, redshift, cosmos, big query, etc. they don&#39;t publish their code, but there is plenty happening under the covers. at this point, i think anyone who acquires machines and installs software has a desire for pain, and isn&#39;t making a sensible business trade off - unless you are an infrastructure company or are operating at high scale.&#34;,
 &#34;&gt; Drop in replacement for PostgreSQLWell that&#39;s impressive. Can I just drop this into my test suite and get a mega speed improvement? Could be worth it.&#34;,
 &#39;Where\x92s the source code? It\x92s open source, I guess?&#39;,
 &#39;http://hyper-db.com/&#39;,
 &#39;Hyper, which was created by the same group, can now be used for free with the Tableau Hyper API\nhttps://help.tableau.com/current/api/hyper_api/en-us/index.h...I especially like the super fast CSV scanning!&#39;,
 &#39;This thread makes it pretty clear to me that managed DB services from the cloud providers are a Very Good Idea on their part.&#39;,
 &#39;One aspect where rdbms development have forgotten to work is to become a real contender for Access/dBase family.You will see a lot of people chasing the &#34;Facebook wanna-be&#34; kind of workloads.I work with small/medium companies (or that are big, but with - Most(all?) rdbms have the same datatypes, mean: Use of nulls (bad) not algebraic types (sad), very unfriendly means to model data/business logic- Use only SQL, that is impractical to anything bigger than basic queries. I work before with foxpro: I could do ALL THE APP with it, including GUIS, reports, etc. So to say SQL is disappointing is to say the less.- All the engine stuff is a black box. That is great, until you wanna do your own index, store columnar data, save array or text or whatever you want, plug into the query executor and do your own stuff, etc.You know, if you have JS and I tell you you can\&#39;t code your own linked list, you will ditch that quickly. Sometimes, if you db engine allow to plug into the storage I could save my graphs for the only time I need it, instead of hack around putting it in tables or worse: Bring ANOTHER db engine to make my life hard.Wait! Why?All that stuff that some put in the middle-wares, model or controllers? In any other product you will reject the tool if you can\&#39;t, but rdmbs FORCE to use anything else to finish it, despite the fact most run in the same box.- Everyone add your own auth tables/logic, because the one implemented in rdbms is for a use case that not exist anymore. Then do it wrong, of course- We are in the http world, but rdbms need something else for that.- Import/Export data is still SAD.- Import/Export data outside the few half-backed attempts (like csv, that a lot of time better you do it with python) is impossible in most. Using foreign adapters could work yet, you need to step out the black box, bring the adapter, compile it, install it, then use it. You need to become a C++ developer, despite you pretend to be a SQL one.That is making thing worse because:- Not exist a &#34;rdbms&#34; packager managers.Look, how great if you just:    db install auth-jwt\n    db install csv-import\n\nend. Like everyone else- Making of forms and reports. You can bet any company (even users!) will kill if their dbs allow to create reports and forms. Yep, alike access. Yep, that is because access is still a thing with the most weak db engine in town.- You wanna allow to send emails, connect to external apis, call system services, etc.But why? Is not that problematic? Well, if you JS (a language FOR THE BROWSER) allow it, why not your db? I live in that world before (foxpro) and it work GREAT.---A lot of this stuff is because the rdbms are look with a too narrow POV. Is crazy: People use half-finished NoSQL engines and are happy making his own query engine, yet talking about do else than SQL (or: plug into the query parser so i enhance it) will sound crazy to some.Rdbms get leap-frog by NoSQL because until very late, get stuck in a mindset and use cases of the 80s.Not exist ANYTHING that say you rdbms must be like all the others.Broad the view is what, I think, rdbms need to do to get invigorated, and considering that are also performant, and very good, then will made to conquer the world!&#39;,
 &#34;isn&#39;t sqlite doing the same ???&#34;,
 &#34;For those who haven&#39;t dug that deep.initramfs is essentially a tiny Linux operating root image that Linux boots to RAM, before it goes on to boot from hard disk.You can actually configure Linux to never go onto the next step of booting from hard disk,  and run the operating system purely from RAM.  Indeed there are distros such as Tinycore Linux that are designed exactly this way which can make things very fast compact and secure and diskless.&#34;,
 &#39;If the article reads as a so-what matter, it is worth remembering that the major Linux distributions often rebuild the ramdisk on kernel upgrade as a post-installation step, which is semi-frequent.  Worse is how slow rebuilding is.&#39;,
 &#39;We at croit.io use it to boot all systems in our environment. Debian uses a better live-boot than most other distributions with Dracut (only half the ram required).After more then 10 years of PXE booting most systems, I personally can definitely say it is rock solid, reduce maintenance times, and makes scaling simple.&#39;,
 &#39;I really enjoyed this article. However the following passage seemed a bit hand-wavy to me:&gt;&#34;How will our userland program know which kernel modules to load? Linux kernel modules declare patterns for their supported hardware as an alias, e.g.:&#34;  initrd# grep virtio_pci lib/modules/5.4.6/modules.alias\n  alias pci:v00001AF4d*sv*sd*bc*sc*i* virtio_pci\n\nDevices in sysfs have a modalias file whose content can be matched against these declarations to identify the module to load:  initrd# cat /sys/devices/pci0000:00/*/modalias\n  pci:v00001AF4d00001005sv00001AF4sd00000004bc00scFFi00\n  pci:v00001AF4d00001004sv00001AF4sd00000008bc01sc00i00\n\n\n&gt;&#34;Hence, for the initial round of module loading, it is sufficient to locate all modalias files within sysfs and load the responsible modules.&#34;Could someone elaborate on this a bit? I\&#39;m familiar with udevd. Is /sysfs enumerated first and then a match is searched for in lib/modules/5.4.6/modules.alias? Or the other way around? Are these files parsed before normal kernel PCI bus enumeration then? Any other specifics or detail would be greatly appreciated.&#39;,
 &#34;This is 20x faster build time to create the initramfs image, is that correct?It&#39;s not 20x faster to boot?&#34;,
 &#39;I want to like dracut, I really do.  It\&#39;s amazingly flexible and dynamic.  Mostly, though, I find it a complete pain in the neck any time I go remotely outside the default behaviour.It gets even worse when you enable debug.  It\&#39;s a series of really nested bash scripts, and enabling debug does &#34;set -x&#34; for everything.  That spews out so much information over serial console / screen that actually tracking down the bug is almost impossible.  The sheer complexity of the embedding and sequence of events means that even innocuous changes can have a way bigger impact than expected.  RedHat changed something between RHEL7.6 and RHEL7.7 and suddenly we were having all sorts of issues with CentOS7 instances booting off iSCSI.The one big positive about it (from my perspective at least)  is that it _does_ make it pretty easy to inject additional functionality in to the initramfs.  Just drop in a bash script with a number prefix relevant to where you want it to occur in the boot order.&#39;,
 &#39;Related work is being done in the u-root project (https://github.com/u-root/u-root).&#39;,
 &#39;This is an excellent article giving into the Initrd pattern.&#39;,
 &#39;He cuts 390ms off of time to passphrase prompt. Does that translate to 390ms faster boot time?I can\x92t remember the last time I sat in front of a Linux box during reboot.  Is that a pittance or a noticeable improvement?&#39;,
 &#34;I use this on all of my systems. It&#39;s great and supports unlocking disks with full disk encryption.https://github.com/slashbeast/better-initramfs&#34;,
 &#39;this article is oddly really knowledgeable and also really unknowledgeable at the same time. despite its length, it doesn\&#39;t explain what an initramfs is or how it\&#39;s created until basically the end (excluding the appendix). an initramfs is simply a cpio archive with a minimum of one file, an executable &#34;/init&#34;, then compressed with a standard compressor. currently gzip, xz, and lz4 are the useful ones.this means that an optimized initramfs creator ought to take as long as a tar file creator, because it basically is a glorified tar file creator. on my system, with a full cache, mkinitcpio takes about 1.5 seconds to run. my custom initramfs generator (not released yet) takes 0.03 seconds to run using &#34;cat&#34; as compressor. it is written entirely in POSIX shell and uses only the external commands ldd, gen_init_cpio, and the compressor. however, if gzip -9 is used for the compressor, then compressing the 12 MB takes 1.8 seconds. so, we can see that compression can significantly inflate (pun intended) the time consumed. as a matter of fact, looking at https://github.com/distr1/distri/blob/master/cmd/distri/init..., it appears to pass no options to gzip, so I assume the default is used, probably -6. http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/dracut.8.html indicates that dracut uses gzip -9 by default, which would increase the time required. if dracut is configured in a non-default manner (e.g. lz4 -12) that would further increase the time.the author credits Go, concurrency, no external dependencies, and threads (?!) for the improved performance. this is manifestly unnecessary: no threads are needed to improve the performance of &#34;tar&#34;, firstly because it is I/O bound, and secondly because the compressor is usually the slowest part anyways. it might be possible to slightly improve the performance by using native code, but there is no substantial difference between running mkinitcpio in 1.0 vs 1.5 seconds, and there\&#39;s definitely no difference between 10.0 and 11.5 seconds (lz4 -12 takes about 10 seconds to run, and I assume the remaining 1.5 seconds can be fully optimized to require 0 seconds).regarding the rest of the post, it\&#39;s... a little weird. I don\&#39;t understand why anyone would manually trudge through modules.dep files when that is the main objective of the &#34;modprobe&#34; command, as opposed to &#34;insmod&#34;, which does no dependency resolution. (modprobe also supports config files, aliases, and some other things, but the main and original objective is dependency resolution.) it\&#39;s also a bad idea to reimplement libblkid: it supports a ton of filesystems, many of which one might actually want to use as a root filesystem, but are not supported by this basic implementation, including xfs, btrfs, or zfs. it also doesn\&#39;t appear to support LUKS2. libblkid isn\&#39;t even necessary: busybox findfs works perfectly well for most common filesystems, and runs very quickly (0.02 seconds on my machine). but, again, the main cost when booting with a necessarily cold cache is likely to be I/O, not spawning a process. I don\&#39;t understand why someone would faff about with manually parsing ELF files when ldd works just fine with simple text parsing and handles interpreter, rpath, and transitive dependencies built-in.this all just seems overly complicated to me. my initramfs generator is 77 lines of code, including automatic ldd dependency generation, and init is 37 lines, including LUKS decryption, dropbear for remote password entry, and e2fsck with automatic reboot if requested by e2fsck, for a total of about 110 lines. I didn\&#39;t count the lines of code for minitrd, but adding together the two files linked is already about 1000 lines of code. mkinitcpio has far more flexibility and is only about 1500 lines for the core code.&#39;,
 &#39;&#34;I currently have no desire to make minitrd available outside of distri. While the technical challenges (such as extending the generator to not rely on distri\&#39;s hermetic packages) are surmountable, I don\&#39;t want to support people\&#39;s initramfs remotely.Also, I think that people\&#39;s efforts should in general be spent on rallying behind dracut and making it work faster, thereby benefiting all Linux distributions that use dracut (increasingly more).&#34;As described on the website unixsheikh.com recently posted to HN^1 and making the front page^2, I think this illustrates one difference between &#34;Linux&#34; and BSD.  Much of what unixsheikh describes has been said before however I think it still remains true today.  I am currently using Linux and open to being persuaded otherwise.  I want to learn &#34;the Linux way&#34; if there is such a thing.That said, I always found booting to ramdisk, &#34;root on mfs&#34;, &#34;mfsroot&#34;, or whatever people might call it, very straightforward on BSD.  They maintained and provided all the necessary tools, some of them have no Linux equivalent.  Things stayed more or less the same so once the process was learnt, there seemed little chance of the goalposts moving.  One did not need to be a contributor to understand these processes.  Sometimes I get the feeling I am just not smart enough for Linux, and it seems like these processes are constantly subject to change.  (I hope to find the truth is otherwise.)As a BSD end user, I found it relatively easy to compile a custom kernel and a custom, statically-linked, multi-call binary as a userland, like busybox but using utilities &#34;as is&#34; not pared down with features missing, to be inserted into the kernel.  I could boot from USB stick^3 to ramdisk root, pull out the USB stick, e.g., if I needed the USB port, then chroot into any userland.  This was extremely flexible and allowed for easy experimentation.  Sometimes I might have that userland prepared on internal media, the USB stick, or some other external media, or I might create it dynamically by downloading and extracting binary sets.  This &#34;targetroot&#34;^4 userland might be mounted, usually r/o, on HDD or it might just be mfs/tmpfs.Apparently, the author was inspired to make his own distribution because he found the package installation process too slow for large packages, e.g. qemu.^5  He tried using SquashFS images to speed up the process.  I did the same thing in 2012 using cloop2 compressed filesystem images for large packages, e.g. ghostscript, on NetBSD.  I would keep them on the USB stick and just mount them over an executable directory as necessary.  I was not using these large programs too frequently and I was running entirely from tmpfs, no HDD, so I did not want them occupying space and depleting RAM.1. https://news.ycombinator.com/from?site=unixsheikh.com2. https://news.ycombinator.com/front?day=2020-01-203. Thanks to the excellent BSD bootloaders I could manually choose the kernel during boot.  I would have several kernels on the USB stick.  Of course the kernel did not have to reside on the USB stick, I could load it from any connected media.  At one point I was able to boot NetBSD kernels using the FreeBSD bootloader.4.  TBH, I still do not know the true story behind targetroot.  Things in BSD always have a history behind them.  Surely there is a story behind the &#34;targetroot&#34; directory.5  https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2019-08-17-linux-package...&#34;How can minitrd be 20 times faster than dracut?dracut is mainly written in shell, with a C helper program. It drives the generation process by spawning lots of external dependencies (e.g. ldd or the dracut-install helper program). I assume that the combination of using an interpreted language (shell) that spawns lots of processes and precludes a concurrent architecture is to blame for the poor performance.&#34;Interesting that dracut uses bash, not dash for its scripts.   Would dash be any faster.  Are bash features a necessity for the simple tasks dracut performs.Also, could dracut use readelf instead of the bash shell script ldd.  According to Wikipedia, the Linux man page for ldd asserts it is a security risk.Does default Ubuntu include a manpage for ldd.  Mine is missing.&#39;,
 &#39;One nice thing about buffets\x97all-you-can-eat or not\x97is that, if you want, you can eat small portions of a wide variety of things, rather than large portions of a small number of dishes.The economics of a buffet are the only reason this is really possible; it\x92s not like you could place an order for e.g. \x93five breaded shrimp, three grams of braised pork, two wontons\x92 worth of wonton soup, ...\x94 from a Chinese restaurant. You could only order each of these in larger amounts, because there are fixed costs to making a dish.&#39;,
 &#34;I organise some tech conferences. We tend to hold our speakers dinner at an upmarket all-you-can-eat buffet, mainly because we have a mix of adventurous and not-so-adventurous eaters.We try to let our speakers and guests have an opportunity to try our local cuisine, but I&#39;m starting to think that buffets aren&#39;t that great for doing so. Travellers new to a country/region wouldn&#39;t know what to take, unless there&#39;s a local by their side explaining the dishes to them.As the person that foots the bill, I also usually observe how much everyone consumes \x97 it&#39;s usually 2-3 small plates worth; probably valued at a quarter of what we&#39;re paying per head.&#34;,
 &#34;I&#39;ve got to shill for yet another all you can eat Polish buffet in Chicagoland that has been open for 40+ years.  Warsaw Inn.  That buffet is really amazing. So good!  Go there.  Eat all the different kinds of pierogies.But also, they mostly just serve polish food, and I don&#39;t remember much if any seafood around either.  It seems like for different types of buffets you&#39;d have different food costs.  Like a sushi buffet probably takes more than a taco buffet.But the article says they think delivery food options killed the buffet.  I&#39;m not so sure, I think fast casual chains were around a lot earlier and did a lot of damage.  You had the same labor savings with not needing dedicated wait-staff, and you could get a lot of people through the doors.  While you can&#39;t cook in huge quantities, I&#39;m sure they do a huge amount of all the prep in batches, which is how they can get the food out relatively quickly.&#34;,
 &#34;I&#39;m still at awe of the Sushi Buffet thing that you can see all around in Helsinki, Finland. So far I have not seen anything like it, anywhere else in the world.Usually the price you pay is 10\x80 for an unrestricted and no time limit access to eating sushi.And the sushi is incredibly okay! It&#39;s nothing compared to stuff you find Tokyo ofcourse, but the price for quality is literally unbeatable.And all this is happening in a city where restaurant prices for main dish are usually around 18-20\x80.What am I missing?&#34;,
 &#39;The other technique not mentioned here is for buffets to just stop refilling the higher cost items on the buffet if a group of big eaters comes in. then let them sit empty while the diners fill up on potatoes or what not, before finally refilling them.&#39;,
 &#39;&#34;By 2030, the National Restaurant Association projects that 80% of all restaurant items will be eaten at home...&#34;I doubt it.  I\&#39;m not convinced that any of the delivery app companies are really making money; by 2030 they may not exist any more.&#39;,
 &#34;The only thing I found more interesting than all-you-can-eat buffets actually turning a profit is that there are business people who are apparently content running a business with such slim margins.This article quotes a 5% margin. I know food industry margins are low in the first place, but as a business owner in a different field I&#39;m left wondering why anyone would even bother. The same business prowess and attention to detail you need to make a buffett run profitably could get you very far in another industry.&#34;,
 &#39;I\&#39;ve seen a number of instances where &#34;all-you-can-eat&#34; rapidly devolves into &#34;all-you-can-find&#34; - where expensive items simply don\&#39;t get refilled until the big eaters go away. We went to a Churrasco place one time with my startup team and the staff more or less spent half the allotted time essentially hiding from us. It was comical, but expensive.The other aspect of buffets is that frequently the food is quite dreadful; they may have steak, but it\&#39;s cheap cuts, cooked to the consistency of a Frisbee. Even if you\&#39;re &#34;beating the buffet&#34; economically, you\&#39;re just eating bad food for no reason.&#39;,
 &#34;The Red Apple, quoted in the story, closed their original location (that had been open for 30 years) last summer to make way for condos. At 5% margins it&#39;s pretty easy to see how a builder could make them a great or even life-changing offer.&#34;,
 &#39;The danger for consumers is assuming this is a zero-sum and that the converse economic goal applies to you (i.e. assuming that the consumer benefits by eating a lot or focusing on meat). I conjecture that after factoring in the economics of health and quality of life, the economic optimum for a typical buffet consumer is the same as for any other eater: to eat sparingly and in a balanced manner.&#39;,
 &#39;I sometimes drink a stupid amount of diet soda.  I know drinks are usually high margin, but I wouldn\&#39;t be surprised if some places lose money on me.  I went to a Denny\&#39;s recently and tried to count the number of refills I got, but I lost count.  This is the same Denny\&#39;s I went to in college, where the waitress knew me.  She\&#39;d drop two pitchers of Diet Coke on the table before she took my order.The epitaph on my tomb stone should probably be &#34;Didn\&#39;t do an autopsy.  We just assumed he was one giant tumor artificial sweetener induced cancer.&#34;&#39;,
 &#34;&gt;The big buffet chains that once dotted the Midwest have been hit the hardest: Old Country Buffet is down to 17 of its 350 original locations; HomeTown Buffet has closed 217 of its 250 eateries; Ryan\x92s Buffet has downsized from 400 to 16.I am not surprised.I went to an Old Country Buffet about two decades ago during the time I was working in a hospital kitchen. I recognized a lot of their dishes from work, they were serving the same lowest quality cheap food that we served to the patients.Now Old Country Buffet has to compete with the variety of high-quality restaurants we have available today. Customer&#39;s tastes have changed and now eating a reasonable amount of higher quality food seems more desirable than eating unlimited hospital food.There are high quality buffets thought, Indian buffets are the best thing ever. But the low quality ones are dying out.&#34;,
 &#39;This article links to two (!) different Wansink studies.&#39;,
 &#34;I liked buffets a lot but in the last 15 years all but one buffet I liked to go to went dramatically downhill in quality. It is likely this was due to cost cutting measures to stay competitive. Eventually it got to where dishes and cutlery weren&#39;t even cleaned properly and I&#39;d have to dig through a stack to find one without residue, and I was getting food poisoning about a quarter of the time. I simply had to stop going, they were bad, and unsafe. This is likely why there has been a mass purging of buffet chains nationally during this time period. It&#39;s not that the public has lost their interest in buffets, it&#39;s that people have noticed the quality is too low to be acceptable despite the price, which isn&#39;t a bargain anyway for any but those that game the system as is mentioned in the article, or for the ultimate in low cost places like all you can eat combination sushi-thai-vietnamese-mongolianBBQ-Chinese-italian-jello-mac&#39;n&#39;cheese lunch places only $4.99, or $3.99 if you use the pennysaver coupon.Like the top comment mentions, some of us don&#39;t want to gorge ourselves, it&#39;s nice to have a variety of things to sample, but also buffets are useful for weekday lunch since you can be in and out with a full meal much faster than you can in a restaurant where you have to wait for your order.One remaining buffet that&#39;s still good quality in my area is a certain classy Indian restaurant. They only do the buffet for lunch from 11-2, so it&#39;s impossible for people to come in and eat for 4 hours straight. Also there&#39;s almost no meat at all, so the restaurant doesn&#39;t appeal to those who come in to eat a pile of steaks. I&#39;ve never seen anyone come and just eat plate after plate. People come because they can get good vegetarian food quickly for lunch.High quality buffets will likely survive, but there&#39;s less of a market for them.A successful hybrid model might be that of Olive Garden, which mixes reheated frozen food with unlimited breadsticks and salad, both which are extremely cheap to provide unlimited quantities of.&#34;,
 &#39;Makes me wonder how the &#34;Paradox of Choice&#34; works in this situation since the customer is already committed to purchasing. Does this lead to more-than-usual consumption (cf. the usual shying away from purchase in a Choice paradox scenario)&#39;,
 &#34;&gt;A German triathlete was asked to prematurely leave an $18.95 buffet after consuming 100 plates of sushi.Gotta love this guy&#39;s confidence in the ability of the budget restaurant to procure and handle properly high quality fresh seafood&#34;,
 &#39;&gt; Even higher-end buffets, like the $98 brunch at the Hotel del Coronado in San Diego, employ these tactics: \x93They hide the truffles, the foie gras, and the oysters,\x94 says Britt. \x93You literally can\x92t find them.\x94I honeymooned are The Del, and they kindly comped our brunch for our entire stay. This was for the downstairs brunch, which doesn\x92t have as much meat but is still amazing. It\x92s about $40/person these days, and considering all that it includes (made to order eggs, bacon, waffles, pancakes, pastries, fruit, desserts, and fresh squeezed juice), and the level of service, it\x92s a pretty good value.&#39;,
 &#39;While very occasionally a buffet can be fun, I usually consider them not so great an experience. Yes, it is nice to be able to decide yourself the relative composition of ingredients, like adding the extra piece of meat or a lot of your favorite vegetable, but too often you end out with a strange mix of stuff on your plate. A plate, which as described in the article, usually is to small of this. So while you might get a little bit more food, it is often less quality, than if you had ordered a prepared dish. And of course, many restaurants offer dishes which are smaller or lager.&#39;,
 &#34;I stopped going to all-you-can-eat buffets years ago  for the  simple reason that you don&#39;t stop eating when you&#39;re full - you stop eating when you hate yourself.If the number of all-you-can-eat buffets drops, it&#39;s likely because society is starting to advocate healthier lifestyles in my opinion.&#34;,
 &#39;According to Drawdown, reducing food waste is the top  individual action one can take to reduce one\x92s impact on climate change. Buffets tend to be quite wasteful and/or encourage serving older food a lot more than a la carte orders. There could be some exceptions, such as buffets in hotels where it\x92s included in the room rent and is a lot easier to plan for (the quantities) based on the number of guests and the guest demographics.As a consumer, if you want value for money in a buffet, the best bets, IMO, are fresh foods and/or the ones that aren\x92t processed much. All the high sugar and high fat processed foods tend to be made with low quality ingredients while also being terrible for health. Also focus on enjoying the variety with smaller quantities of everything you\x92d like to eat rather than trying to eat a lot more than your usual appetite.&#39;,
 &#39;Guess the owners would not appreciate the local Keto meetup having an event at their buffet.&#39;,
 &#39;The labor advantages for buffet-style restaurants generalizes - you eliminate a lot of downtime due to timing variability when you switch from make-to-order to make-to-inventory, reducing labor costs significantly. You can get this without a buffet model in restaurants, most notably with the conveyor-belt sushi restaurants that charge per dish you take.&#39;,
 &#34;I saw a great solution to the over-eating problem in one sushi spot in Italy. Not exactly a buffer, but you could pay upfront and order as much as you want per person. The caveat is that you can only order four servings at once and you pay the full a&#39;la carte price for everything you hadn&#39;t fully eaten.&#34;,
 &#34;There&#39;s one Argentinian buffet in Madrid (in Plenilunio mall if someone is interested) with an unusual system: they bring the food around the tables and you pick what you want. Most of it is barbecued meat. I avoid going there because I can&#39;t help eating too much every time.&#34;,
 &#39;Buffets are making money on impatient customers who are piling up on fries and mac-n-cheese and other super cheap &#34;fillers&#34; and junk foods before discovering and allocating space for more delicious and expensive dishes that are typically placed at the far end of a food isles.This way they compensate the losses caused by my visit.\nI don\&#39;t touch any food until i do complete walkaround and learn about everything they have to offer.Then i typically pigout on lobster legs, tenderloin cuts, fish-rich sushi and other high end proteins, carefully avoiding any cheaper &#34;fillers&#34;. My visit to buffet would cost me the equivalent of ~$200 visit in a-la-carte restaurant.&#39;,
 &#34;I wonder if the growth of intermittent fasting is gonna reduce even further the number of all-you-can-eat buffets.\nFast for an entire day (or 2 if you&#39;re feeling brave), then gorge yourself the next day at a buffet.&#34;,
 &#39;I remember a story from my dad that one of he and one of his friends use to eat at this one lunch time all you can eat buffet in the 80s. Unfortunately, one of his friends spoiled the deal by getting more to eat, he even asked the restaurant staff for a bigger spoon. In the end, they were banned (even though my dad I think had only two plates since he had a busy day ahead) from the restaurant.&#39;,
 &#34;There was an all you can eat sushi place, they charge you for the sushi that you couldn&#39;t finish.  I thought that was a pretty good way to charge.&#34;,
 &#34;If I do go to a buffet I only eat protein because it seems to be the only way to get my money&#39;s worth.&#34;,
 &#34;back when i lived in the south, I would go to all you can eat chinese buffets and just eat crab legs. They even had scallops on their mongolian bar! They always lost money when I came in. These places are impossible to find and I don&#39;t think exist anymore for less than $20.&#34;,
 &#39;A friend of mine, not a native speaker, calls them &#34;eat all you can&#34; buffets.&#39;,
 &#39;To quote a well-known Dutch hotel/restaurant owner: \n&#34;They\&#39;ll eat me poor but drink me rich&#34;. The margin on the food may be thin, but drink margins are usually more like 75-100%.&#39;,
 &#39;I thought this was going to be about US healthcare.&#39;,
 &#39;Meanwhile in France...https://www.lesgrandsbuffets.com/en&#39;,
 &#39;Buffets are great but there\x92s something off with the food at the all you can eat buffets with fixed price. Probably the food is of lesser quality..&#39;,
 &#39;I read this while at a buffet.&#39;,
 &#39;i wonder if you can ever just take the steam tray a la homer.&#39;,
 &#39;The trick is cheap food and tons of glutamate.&#39;,
 &#39;now im hungry&#39;,
 &#34;Vegetarian on diet:  I eat at Golden Corral, only salad, watermelon, cole slaw, stir fried veggies (lot&#39;s of red bell peppers and some fresh pineapple), little rice, unsweetened tea  - -  and I only go from 2 pm to 4 pm weekdays when the price as $8 or $9 for senior, no charge for drink. It&#39;s pure torture to stay away from the dessert bar.I cannot buy that variety anywhere for that price.&#34;,
 &#34;The simple trick is you need to price it such that any combination will always cover the costs of the most expensive meal.-Don&#39;t just downvote, explain why it won&#39;t work.&#34;,
 &#39;They mention Golden Corral. They save money, notoriously, by serving &#34;Dumpster-Aged&#34; ribs.https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/1hubzj/all_you_can_...There\&#39;s even an ad they ran that featured this:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lj43JdXjLNQ&#39;,
 &#39;We badly need a good replacement - ICANN has recently been making it abundantly clear how poor a choice it is to rely on an opaque, unaccountable centralized entity for something as crucial as DNS.Whether or not you agree with their decision, this whole saga fails to inspire confidence in their processes and long-term neutrality.A particularly concerning quote:&#34;Those PICs were published months later but ICANN went out of its way to make sure they weren\x92t noticed: it published them on a sub-site that requires people to register to access information, instead of using its normal public comment process, and it made no public announcement about the publication, despite promising to do so.&#34;&#39;,
 &#39;I personally blame ICANN more than the corporations here.No individual entity -- person, place or corporation -- needs a TLD.  They\&#39;re TLDs, they\&#39;re for giant collections of people, places and things.But once ICANN says, &#34;Hey, would you like to buy ?  It\&#39;d be a shame if someone else did.&#34;, most any company is going to say, &#34;Goddammit, fine&#34;, and then once you\&#39;ve spent the money on it, you might as well start using it, with store.YOURCOMPANY and about.YOURCOMPANY and mail.YOURCOMPANY, and now the conventions of hierarchical domains and the very notion of URLs is meaningless.I do blame all of us webdevs for getting cutesy with with making the TLD part of your company/domain name.&#39;,
 &#39;Of course, if the company would have been called something like &#34;Niagara Falls&#34;, or &#34;Yosemite&#34;, or &#34;Grand Canyon&#34; and the US government protested, we know the result would have been very different. Just another example of how unjust and unequal in general the administration of domain names is.&#39;,
 &#39;You can find the agreement here:https://www.icann.org/resources/agreement/amazon-2019-12-19-...I would like to actually see the discussions leading to this agreement.The ideal version of ICANN is to be the &#34;UN of the Internet&#34;, but its recent actions make it sustainable that there are too many commercial motives involved.&#39;,
 &#39;They can still get an \x93.amazonas\x94 tld.It\x92s not like Spain has a .es and a .sp or the US has a .us and the .eu tld.If Amazon the company didn\x92t exist or it was called \x93the warehouse\x94 these countries would give a rat\x92s ass about the .amazon gtld.&#39;,
 &#39;I am sheepishly conflicted.On the one hand, I get that domains and TLDs are important aspects of branding, people care about making sure terms are tied to the most salient endpoints.On the other hand... isn\&#39;t this whole system a bit like some guy in a basement writing a list of words next to various numbers? Then we all just decided to tell our machines to listen to that guy?It feels weird to me to be angry at the phone book I chose to use.And if all popular indexing methods are subject to public debate, we end up in strange places.We might single out ICANN as special, more important, but given how many people go through search to land on websites, rather than typing domains directly, in some ways ICANN is just pushing one index in a crowded field. In some ways Google is more ICANN than ICANN. Google\&#39;s top level results for amazon (and java and cheddar etc.) aren\&#39;t places.If we don\&#39;t really like how some guy maps symbols to symbols, maybe we should just make your own map that we do like better? If it is better, promote it, maybe it catches on. Namecoin and Tor basically do this, though they\&#39;re limited to certain use cases. Some alternate DNS resolvers block/re-map known malicious sites. ICANN isn\&#39;t forcing us to care about any of its decisions.I don\&#39;t know, I have enormous uncertainty here, and &#34;hey just abandon a core feature of the internet&#34; is definitely too glib given how unsure I am about all this.But still, it\&#39;s just an arbitrarily filled map. It feels really weird to me to be angry at a random lookup table. Maybe just walk away from it instead.EDIT: larkeith\&#39;s top level comment also ends up at ICANN replacement, with far more sympathy and less bewilderment along the way, I respect that a lot.EDIT 2: Brevity. Still failed but trying.&#39;,
 &#34;This is a tabloid drama story for nerds.. a domain dispute over a hypothetical website jointly owned by multiple countries? That website doesn&#39;t even exist and probably was never on the radar until the domain came up.It is appealing to view the web like physical land and seeing this as a border dispute but it only goes so far. If the (non-existent, hypothetical) website is discoverable on search engines and the URL is published by the government&#39;s it works just as well&#34;,
 &#34;&#39;Amazon&#39; is an _English_ translation of a _Greek_ name given to an _Eurasian_ tribe. What claim do _South American_ nations have for it?I loathe to defend Amazon and ICANN of all the fucking things, but come on now. There are plenty of reasons to shit on these two, but not this nonsense. &#39;Illegal&#39;, lmao.&#34;,
 &#39;IMO South American countries should just ban the corporate-owned .amazon from local DNS. The least they can do is boycott the domain.&#39;,
 &#34;Sounds like Brazil was the one being unreasonable here.  It looks like a shakedown of Amazon.  Lest you think of Amazon as a big, powerful, org compared with Brazil, remember that the Brazilian government&#39;s budget for 2020 is over $900 billion dollars.&#34;,
 &#39;The world is running at full speed towards a dystopia where private companies are more powerful than entire countries.&#39;,
 &#39;This is stupid.  These countries have no right to this TLD just because the forest of that name is located there.  If they had wanted it they should have applied for it first.  It is equally as stupid as saying that Jeff Bezos can\&#39;t use the name &#34;Amazon&#34; because it is owned by the owners of the Amazon rainforest, or saying that Brazil can\&#39;t name its rainforest &#34;Amazon&#34; because that is a Greek mythological term and, therefore, owned by Greece.  Nobody owns the word &#34;Amazon&#34;&#39;,
 &#34;The root problem isn&#39;t who should operate individual gTLDs (ICANN always owns it) it&#39;s that gTLDs aren&#39;t restricted in ways that make it so people aren&#39;t worried about who is operating it. In an ideal DNS ACTO would be ecstatic someone else is footing the bill for the gTLD and it&#39;s operation not worried about what that means for their right to use it.&#34;,
 &#34;So Brazil attempted to block the establishment of .amazon because of Snowden revelations that the CIA had wiretapped the president of Brazil&#39;s phone?That seems to suggest, if that causality is correct, that if Amazon weren&#39;t an American company, Brazil wouldn&#39;t have had any objection. So it&#39;s just a naked attempt to use a private company headquartered in a nation another nation is mad at for political horse trading and ICANN made the right decision.&#34;,
 &#34;They should be renamed ICAN&#39;T.&#34;,
 &#39;Some surprises for me -1. Why is VC funding so down the rank compared to self funding, friends and family, angels and even debt? Is it probably because VC funding expects a &gt;100x exit and most SaaS probably can\&#39;t deliver that? Or are SaaS founders turning away from VC for ideological reasons (like want to enjoy the process instead of rushing to justify a valuation?)2. 50%+ people pursued ideas which were not their own itch to scratch.3. 30%+ didn\&#39;t validate before building. 20%+ just asked their audience. Effectively, 50%+ just jumped into it without doing any significant and rigorous testing. Probably because the cost of entry and failure is too low?4. 74% don\&#39;t require a CC to start a trial. (Either infra costs are very low or competition is intense?)5. 80% don\&#39;t offer a forever free plan.6. Most founders don\&#39;t know their website visitor to trial conversion rates.7. &#34;Asking for a credit card before a free trial has\nalmost no correlation with revenue growth.&#34;&#39;,
 &#39;The ultimate issue with all these studies is the sample bias. How did they source the independent SaaS companies (there are over 40 thousand plus, follow power laws and most are economically duds). All samples are biased but there are methods of \x93correcting\x94 the bias. Historical errors are legion:https://www.math.upenn.edu/~deturck/m170/wk4/lecture/case2.h...By the way the key takeaway from this post is that you can make more money driving for Uber than starting an independent SaaS business. You have to be irrational to start an independent SaaS business (applicable to all startups as well).In fact the only folk who benefit from independent SaaS are the supplier food chain. Levi\x92s was the main beneficiary of the gold rush. The SaaS conference organizers seem to be among the beneficiaries of the SaaS \x93gold rush\x94.&#39;,
 &#34;Along these lines, can anyone recommend a framework for developing a SaaS prototype?  Ideally, it would include things like payment processing, user auth, admin dashboards, etc.  I&#39;ve been looking at Laravel Spark, but I&#39;m wondering if people have other suggestions.&#34;,
 &#39;&gt;  More than 25% of respondents have been running their business for 5-10 years, which is longer expected given the relative newness of SaaS, and the high chance a startup fails in its first one or two years.Could this be survivor-ship bias. If you failed your SaaS venture in less than a year, you are less likely to be part of this survey.&#39;,
 &#39;Some context would help in framing this report.MicroConf: &#34;MicroConf is a collection of two-day events laser-focused on self-funded and indie-funded software startups&#34;Rob (Walling): started Tiny Seed Fund: https://tinyseed.com/Tiny Seed Fund: Accelerator for BootStrappers, &#34;... we do this all without the headache of traditional fundraising, loss of control, or the pressure to build a unicorn.&#34;So, it provides some clarity as to why BaseCamp (formerly 37 Signals) aided in the production of the report, certainly when you take their own genesis and growth into account. As far as I know they only had one small outside investment, from Jeff Bezos:&#34;In 2006, Jeff Bezos bought a minority, no-control stake of Basecamp from Jason and me.&#34; \nhttps://m.signalvnoise.com/the-deal-jeff-bezos-got-on-baseca...Cheers, Ace.&#39;,
 &#39;Recorded livestream: https://microconf.com/saas-this-year&#39;,
 &#39;&gt; and the high chance a startup fails in its first one or two years.I never understood why people like to spread this &#34;fact&#34; around. Of course a company will fail in it\&#39;s first years, if not, it\&#39;s a company that is at least not failing.Also, it means nothing, not all companies are started equal and these statistics mix everything and everyone in the same basket, there is too much noise involved for this metric to mean anything.&#39;,
 &#34;&gt; Diversity continues to be an issue in SaaS. Only 11% of founding teams include a non-male and 21% include a non-white founderI find this line absolutely infuriating. And I&#39;m disappointed it&#39;s right at the start. Must there always be an issue when the data doesn&#39;t suit a worldview? Why compromise a survey &#39;s integrity with your own bias?It costs virtually $0 these days to start a SaaS company, regardless of gender, ethnicity or religious creed.

 &#39;If you want to learn more about the quantum search algorithm, I got a lot out of this pretty in-depth essay on how it works-https://quantum.country/search&#39;,
 &#39;anything that is cyclical or periodic is going to have a Pi in the formula that describes its behavior&#39;,
 &#34;This is fascinating to this very-much-a-math-beginner person.It&#39;s like a glimpse into another dimension.&#34;,
 &#34;Grant Sanderson is doing such amazing work in divulgation of science and mathematics, promoting, I think, real understanding rather than the mere illusion of fluency.  He&#39;s like the opposite extreme from WIRED Magazine, Chris Anderson, Malcolm Gladwell, and Deepak Chopra.&#34;,
 &#39;And here I was wondering if 3B would be powerful enough, or would I need to get a 4.&#39;,
 &#39;Almost all articles I\&#39;ve seen explaining the context pkg are done with net/http examples.That\&#39;s fine but I feel like it might not be the best introduction for a novice as a lot of concepts are mixed together and they might miss the bigger picture. Context is not just for web servers. You don\&#39;t have to know how net/http works.You could simply demonstrate the usefulness of the context package with showing how to properly clean up your program on a sigterm. Or even gracefully stop a long running operation so you are not afraid to stop/start your program at the &#34;wrong&#34; time.&#39;,
 &#39;I tried running Go HTTP servers bare to the internet (after Cloudflare promoted doing so in a blog post), but went back to using a reverse proxy the next time.The main benefit seems to be convenience. I can upgrade and graceful-restart nginx instead of having to rebuild and redeploy the Go server (involving a full app restart). Not having to worry about goroutine leaks because some jerk decided to send the request line @ 1 byte/sec is just an added bonus.&#39;,
 &#34;There&#39;s an ugly bug in http.TimeoutHandler though - it obscures stack traces so that it&#39;s impossible to use them to locate panic in decorated handler:\nhttps://github.com/golang/go/issues/27375&#34;,
 &#34;Ok, good, contexts are now making sure you can handle upcoming timeouts decided by an upper layer (caller function). But how about the time.After function? It&#39;ll still be running in the background? So you can still have a memory or &#39;processing power&#39; leak?&#34;,
 &#39;Nice intro to timeouts and context.  Next step would be dealing with state changes that happen in a cancelled request.&#39;,
 &#34;absolutely agree with the risk of slow clients saturating your connection limitwhen doing DB work with these, I&#39;m a little shakier -- once I start a multistep DB write, I probably want it to finish. Yes I can use a transaction to roll back the whole thing, but I think there are cases where rollback is wrong and I&#39;d rather keep the write.so while cancellation is cool, it&#39;s also a little fraught and hard to test.&#34;,
 &#34;Shouldn&#39;t read header timeout be less than read timeout?&#34;,
 &#39;I scrolled through the whole article and didn\x92t get a blaring ad like that.&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah, I quit reading when I get the unblockable full page ad asking me about paying 50 dollars for a Go course.  Good spam bot.&#39;,
 &#39;I\&#39;m a self taught programmer and started developing for Android in 2012. It took me a while before I realised that you needed third party libraries to do absolutely anything useful as the platform APIs were so poor and undocumented. There were gaps everywhere and you needed to write tons of boilerplate code to do things properly.Image loading was often a huge source of crashes due to out-of-memory errors and doing it properly wasn\&#39;t trivial [0]. Libraries like &#34;Glide&#34; and &#34;Picasso&#34; solved this.Using the camera hardware was awful. Device manufacturers would implement things differently, and break the camera API unexpectedly. Only recently [1] are we starting to see sane, consistent camera APIs.Making network requests felt extremely clunky, and the platform JSON implementation wasn\&#39;t performant, or easy to use as you had to manually parse everything. Retrofit [2] made talking to REST services much easier.I could go on and on, but I\&#39;m sure there\&#39;s plenty others here who can do that here. These days Android development is much, much more enjoyable. Kotlin has pretty much replaced Java in the Android ecosystem, and there\&#39;s great reasources around on how to architect your app to  make everything testable and easily scalable such as the architecture samples [3]. I\&#39;ve worked on a few React Native projects in the last year. I\&#39;m not a fan of it, but I definitely see the industry heading to some cross platform solution eventually.[0]. https://developer.android.com/topic/performance/graphics/loa...[1]. https://developer.android.com/training/camerax[2]. https://square.github.io/retrofit/[3]. https://github.com/android/architecture-samples&#39;,
 &#39;I should\x92ve known that it\x92s turtles all the way down. Considering how many years I\x92ve sunk into programming for other platforms, this shouldn\x92t have come as a surprise, but I got suckered into believing that mobile computing platforms represented a significant enough paradigm shift to allow for starting with a cleaner slate.Not true! Having gotten into iOS development over the past couple of years, I\x92ve come to realize that seemingly no attempt has been made to actually clear the cobwebs on this shiny, relatively new platform.For example, SwiftUI is just an abstraction layer for UIKit, which itself is (keep me honest, HN) an abstraction for some mishmash of Cocoa, Display PostScript and Metal. Bits of NeXTSTEP are everywhere still, even when using Apple\x92s latest and greatest programming paradigms.Don\x92t get me wrong, iOS is great, and I love it to death. However, the baggage signals to me that a massive opportunity to start anew has been missed.&#39;,
 &#39;It depends somewhat on why you ask.A lot of people are recommending using cross platform solutions. As a hobby or learning exercise, go for it! As someone who has a career across many projects working full time as a native iOS and Android dev, I can say these solutions are generally avoided. They are good for prototypes you don\x92t plan to maintain long term, I\x92ll give them that.I know it\x92s cheesy but my only regret is I didn\x92t go all-in on mobile sooner. I have been on a constant upward career trajectory since the day I put my first app on the store. Get an app on the store as soon as you can and if it gets traction listen to feedback and update it. If you\x92re early in your career this will be the only thing on your resume that matters. I highly recommend you start with iOS just because the tools are more friendly for beginners. Watch WWDC/Google IO sessions and keep up with the latest. However it\x92s best to keep a healthy distance with things that only support the newest OS. For instance I wouldn\x92t build an app in SwiftUI yet but I follow it like a hawk because it\x92s likely to be the only way Apple platform apps are made very soon. Closely follow VR/AR frameworks and machine learning. Those will become must-know this decade.Mobile dev is so rewarding! Every developer should at least dip their toes in.&#39;,
 &#34;I wish I would have not fought the tools so much.I started Android programming from the command line using make/ant and testing on a device because I didn&#39;t like Android Studio.  This ended up wasting a lot of time and energy over the years as I had to integrate more 3rd party libraries (including Google&#39;s own crap).Same thing for iOS.  I didn&#39;t like building GUIs in Interface Builder so I did everything in code.  Over time as iOS devices came in different sizes, this became harder to do properly.  I should have given in early and learned to use Interface Builder, auto layout, etc.&#34;,
 &#39;That developing for Android isn\x92t even as half as smooth as developing for iOS. Yes, with iOS you\x92re using Xcode and have to set up provisioning for your dev device and all that, but once you\x92ve done that you\x92re mostly on your way. UIKit, while not the shiniest thing out there, is quite competent and functional \x97 you can easily write world class apps with it while keeping third party libraries to a minimum.On Android, setting up for development is a bit faster but the actual development story is so, so much worse. Kotlin improved things a great deal and Jetpack improves it further, but it still has such a long way to go. You\x92ll spend inordinate amounts of time researching the \x93right\x94 way to do things only to find that there really isn\x92t one, but instead several ways with varying levels of wrongness with different trade offs. Even mundane things will be a source of trouble and you will likely have to make concessions in your UI design to work around Android SDK awkwardness.If I could just have UIKit on Android I would be a much, much happier Android dev. Hoping Jetpack Compose improves the situation but I\x92m not holding my breath.&#39;,
 &#34;The thing that would&#39;ve saved me the most time and frustration in the long run for all mobile development (well, all dev period, but mobile especially as they tend to be moving targets):Ignore the framework.  Write your app how you want to write it, then attach it to the framework as needed.  Don&#39;t restrict yourself to what the framework supplies or how it thinks about things.It&#39;ll dramatically decrease craziness in your core logic in the long run.  Framework versions and bugs can lead to strange lifecycle callbacks, weird interactions between the N flavors of how to build UI components, etc, and if your core logic is chopped up to deal with all of this it can become very hard to make important changes.  Such as updating to a newer version of the framework so your app isn&#39;t removed from the stores.It&#39;ll pretty much always be more up-front code and work, but you&#39;ll be left with a far clearer system in the end.&#34;,
 &#34;I regret not knowing about cross-platform development such as Flutter and ReactOS.I also regret not buying a book explaining all the concepts in as simple a manner as possible. As a semi-amateur programmer, I feel like most of the documentation is meant to refresh the memories of people who have been developing apps for years; they&#39;re extremely beginner-hostile.&#34;,
 &#39;I regret not knowing that Android API is awful.Then I regret looking into Nativescript, because it was pretty buggy.Then I regret not knowing about Flutter earlier.THEN I regret not knowing that Flutter is pretty buggy as well.Next step is me trying to learn other frameworks, like Cordova or React Native. I wonder what my regrets will be.&#39;,
 &#34;On Android, that there hasn&#39;t been much love for C/C++ and the NDK is full of interesting pitfalls:Oh your camera gives you NV21 frames, but the hardware VP8 encoder only accepts I420? Makes perfect sense.Oh, we don&#39;t actually let you query what format the encoder expects until a later API than you&#39;re using. Just try them in a loop until one doesn&#39;t fail, makes perfect sense.The camera was a party too, added a listener for Camera session events and the app crashed. Yay.&#34;,
 &#39;If you built it, they wont come. Without marketing, the odds of your customers discovering the app (amongst a sea of garbage) are insanely low. I tried a Tennis app in 2009 and even back then it was competing with hundreds of other apps, now its mist likely 10\x92s of thousands. Heart breaking.&#39;,
 &#39;The years it took to realize how under-resourced the NDK team is, bothering to create my own NDK wrappers to work around the NDK bindings and forced JNI calls, manually dealing with dependencies across NDK projects.In retrospect, it would have been easier to just rewrite the whole thing in Android Java.Basically, how little Google cares for game related development workflows on Android.It just took them 10 years to acknowledge this, go figure.https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2019/12/android-ga...&#39;,
 &#39;Don\x92t underestimate the value of build tools. Just because you know Xcode and Swift or Android Studio and Kotlin (or their antecedent languages) are you done. Finally having a senior dev who knows what he\x92s talking about has done more for me in the past two years than the previous 8 of reading blog posts and hacking. He\x92s shown me the real value of build scripts. Today even my personal iOS projects are dependent on a combination of Swift, Ruby, YAML, and Kotlin to build. It\x92s complicated to set up but I can prove that my code works.&#39;,
 &#39;Been doing Android development for 8+ years.  The main thing to realize is that nobody actually knows what they\&#39;re doing.  You\&#39;ll have a problem and spend hours and hours just searching for &#34;the answer&#34; but it\&#39;s not out there.  Everyone who has solved it has used their own hacks, and they\&#39;re not going to be able to transfer the hack to you.Once you realize this it\&#39;s somewhat liberating.  You focus on the bug/feature and not the method.  One time I was trying to solve a particularly nasty layout-at-runtime problem and just realized I could write my own ViewGroup and lay it all out myself, pixel by pixel, faster than fighting RelativeLayout or whatever.  And that code is more stable than something where I import some library that\&#39;s not going to be maintained.&#39;,
 &#39;I regret it took me 5 years of mobile development (both platforms) to realize I really don\x92t like writing GUI code. I switched to backend and infrastructure work and I\x92ve been a lot happier since.&#39;,
 &#39;Example code is invariably dross from an architectural point of view.Unit tests are still valuable in a mobile environment.Most good apps are simple. Simplicity is not easy.Some aspects of mobile development will become far easier over time (memory management on iOS) while some will remain in a baffling stasis (refactoring tools in Xcode). It\x92s impossible to predict which category an aspect belongs to ahead of time.There are times to embrace the approach taken by a platform, and times to distance yourself from it.Mobile as a platform will crush all before it and transform society, while most contemporary technological hopes will remain geek toys.The remembering self can really help out the experiencing self; you can never learn too much about the past, present, and future of mobile programming.&#39;,
 &#34;That Apple and Google would move the goalposts so often, and with such vigor, that it&#39;d result in classes of programmers who do nothing BUT support the mobile platform for development.It has been a nightmare of keeping up with the majors, just to be able to enter their carefully curated arena.Nowadays when I build an App, I do Linux/Mac/Windows first, and the iOS/Android release, next.  Fortunately there is a vast industry out there for toolkits and frameworks for solving The Platform Problem\x99 which has been shoved down our throats by a ravenous corporate culture which is hell-bent on ensuring that they own the computing platforms of the future.&#34;,
 &#34;That JavaScript (and prior to that, Java) would work for mobile, one platform to rule them all.Work = looks and feels native, good performance, good widget collection, development that doesn&#39;t fight the platform, and all those available not 10 years after the platform was introduced.&#34;,
 &#39;For android, get good at handling null everywhere in everything checking all the time now, or learn it the hard way later.  You\&#39;ll be spending lots of time tracking down &#34;wait, how could that have ever possibly returned a null?&#34;Ditto async and observer and livedata type stuff.  Never move data between things any way other than async.  MVVM and all that, with caching repositories and stuff.Architecture changes fast enough that you have to be careful not to waste time and effort supporting some ancient version and NIH writing your own implementations of stuff that\&#39;s newly added in current versions.  Yet if you try to ship using cool alpha quality features, that\&#39;s a whole different headache.  For extra fun you can end up with both problems at the same time in different parts of the app.&#39;,
 &#34;I got pretty good at Android development and made a few apps that don&#39;t have many downloads but I&#39;m still proud of and wanted to share with my friends and family.I regret that all of my friends and family have iPhones.&#34;,
 &#39;I develop for Android since 2011. Since 2016 I also do more iOS. I mostly regret not looking into new developments faster. Things like Kotlin and Architecture Components. They are great, so at least experiment a bit with them to see what all the fuzz is about. Try to keep up!Also, I wish I realized that Google Play is giving you a lot of stats and data about your apps (store) performance these days, which in most cases can help pinpoint a issue with your reach/growth.I also regret everything about Objective C ;)&#39;,
 &#39;I regret thinking that Xamarin was a good idea.&#39;,
 &#39;On iOS:\x95 Interface builder(especially Storyboards) is inferior to using UIKit straight from code\x95 Coordinator pattern, which lets you split logic and view controllers. https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles/71/how-to-use-the-...&#39;,
 &#34;On Android: being paranoid about multithreading in all the wrong places before I stopped worrying and love the main thread.Move actual work off thread whenever possible, but never try to integrate off threat memory access by hand using synchronized and friends, just enqueue your final result plumbing on the main looper.Be paranoid about multithreading in the right places, particularly when you hand a callback to some black box. A callback that checks the thread it&#39;s running on to enqueue itself on main if necessary might become a familiar pattern. You might start to hate all callback methods that don&#39;t return void.&#34;,
 &#34;I can&#39;t really say I regret the path I&#39;ve taken since had I not taken it, I wouldn&#39;t be able to form sound evaluations. I&#39;d always sought out cross-platform development tools first on servers, then desktop, and mobile. Flutter/Dart comes closest at the moment but game engines might also work for certain apps. I&#39;m glad I never bought into React-Native the worst of worlds. It&#39;s rare for an app to require native widgets and having to deal with two different sets and their idiosyncrasies isn&#39;t solving the problem.&#34;,
 &#34;I started with iOS in 2009. I wish I hadn&#39;t used Core Data, and made the decision to store lots of large binary blobs in it. Changing the schema became impossible, because the migration process often crashed or ran out of disk space in production. That, coupled with lots of Core Data crashes that persist (pun intended) to this day. It may have been easier to just use SQLite directly.My decision to use NSThread for worker threads wasn&#39;t optimal either, but there weren&#39;t many async options in 2009 (Remember ASIHTTPRequest?)&#34;,
 &#39;That mobile web apps aka PWAs are a perfect fit for classical data-driven applications. The return on investment for 2 native apps vs. a PWA is far...&#39;,
 &#39;I should\&#39;ve started a year later when ARC was introduced (I started learning between 2011 - 2013).Learning iOS dev with reference counting as a memory management system was really painful. My programming skill wasn\&#39;t up to speed yet to &#34;just&#34; learn a new language. I only knew some university Java at the time. And while I did write impressive projects with it, I wasn\&#39;t strong enough in an algorithmic sense.Learning a framework and learning memory management, and kind of needing to deal with pointers but not really proved to be too much.When ARC was introduced it was a breeze.Now, when I read this whole comment, nowadays I\&#39;d think: this is such nonsense. Memory management should not be a barrier to learn iOS dev. But when you\&#39;re in that weird space of that you kind of know how to program (5000+ lines code) but you really need to get into it, and it doesn\&#39;t feel natural yet. Then, yea, it does matter a lot.A few years later I learned C and had no issues learning pointers or memory management. To be fair, I didn\&#39;t need to use any frameworks with C.&#39;,
 &#39;The whole damn thing. I\x92m self taught web developer, server management, backend stuff. I love a Rest over HTTP API. X Code and all the sims do not jive with my brain.  Swift helped a bit. But only ever able to build a bouncing ball game. The process of launching on an app store alone seems insane. I started by FTP and Perl then PHP. I pay people to  write code these days.&#39;,
 &#39;React Native isn\x92t nearly as good as the hype suggests, and the pain only gets worse as your project grows.&#39;,
 &#39;If you think you will ever be cross platform, do yourself a favor and write as much of the business logic as you can in C++ or C. The platform-specific piece should be small and \x93just enough to make the platform happy\x94. Do everything else portably from the start.&#39;,
 &#39;To get into mobile sooner. I was tired of the web and burned out needed something different. I\x92m getting way more work and enjoying myself a lot more. I hope to have a long career programming so maybe I\x92ll change platforms again one day.&#39;,
 &#39;MVC, the way it\x92s implemented in UIKit, leads to code that is very difficult to test, mixes business logic and view layout and navigation, and leads to massive view controllers. You have to be very careful to avoid it.&#39;,
 &#39;When doing custom UI animation code that isn\x92t native, expect 2-10x more development, testing and polish, and still won\x92t achieve it perfectly.&#39;,
 &#39;I built an iOS game using Sprite Kit and had to hack together support for multiple screen sizes later which was kind of a pain. Likewise they make you provide an app icon of like 25 different sizes. Have not done standard UI work yet but unless you use a \x93reactive\x94 set of layouts I can only imagine the pain.&#39;,
 &#39;I wish I had realised that Android app development ecosystem (the dev tools, API, documentation, gradle, dependency management etc) is a shit show and is going to remain a shit show and I should have moved to backend early in my career. Now companies are very reluctant about it.&#39;,
 &#39;The xcodebuild command line tool is insanely powerful. The one provided by vanilla Xcode is awful.&#39;,
 &#39;I invested lot of years on Android because it is, promoted as open source etc ...  but currently it is just their advertising platform, complete control of it developer (removing developer accounts, blocking apps and devices ) and full monopoly !!&#39;,
 &#34;Go cross platform as soon as you can!  Most folks preaching against it don&#39;t have the practical experience.  If you&#39;re not writing games and writing a non graphic intensive app, it&#39;s the way to go.&#34;,
 &#39;That you need a singleton pattern to ease the gps refresh problem.  Totally rewrite the program before submit to Apple store.&#39;,
 &#39;How hard it would be to Port.&#39;,
 &#39;flutter.&#39;,
 &#34;On the iOS side, I regret not knowing how horrible Xcode is and how horrible Apple&#39;s documentation is. On the Android side, I regret not realizing that no matter what kind of slick new well documented APIs Google releases we will all be writing code for Android 4.4 for the rest of our lives. Also, I wish I knew mobile developers are some of the lowest paid developers other than game industry peons.&#34;,

 &#39;I love reading these kinds of reverse engineering discovery tales, I find them technically educative, and overall enlightening... they help put my own struggles debugging thorny things into sharp perspective, making me even more appreciative of the level of control I have over my own code and it\x92s runtime environments.The level of effort put into reverse engineering for emulating classic hardware of all kinds is just remarkable. The Dolphin EMU team has a long history of these kind of blog posts for people looking for more of this kind of writing https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;ve always had the attitude that if can reproduce a bug consistently, I can debug it, and I can fix it. Now here&#39;s a nail in the coffin of that theory.&#34;,
 &#34;These test ROMs are interesting. Since they are designed to run on real hardware that lacks debugging capabilities, the user must be able to operate the test suite and check the results manually. They aren&#39;t like modern software test suites.According to the nesdev wiki, automation consists of playing back controller input, waiting for the tests to run, taking a screen shot of the results screen, hashing it and comparing the result to the hash of the expected results screen. This method also allows testing real games to check for reproducible bugs.https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Emulator_tests#Automated...Pretty nice. I expected the test ROM to write the results to some special location in memory and have the emulator report those results.&#34;,
 &#34;So uh I didn&#39;t see it mentioned, but the question of why this code is in the games arises.Is it buggy code, or something intentional like anti-emulator sneakery?&#34;,
 &#34;Interesting story. Goes to show you the falacy of writing fault tolerant systems as opposed to writing noisy systems.Had the GBA architects made the device halt on invalid memory rather than return the last thing on the bus and hope everything would be ok this entire class of bug wouldn&#39;t exist and the authors of that code likely would&#39;ve found that bug during production.&#34;,
 &#39;Amazing story. Just shows you how complex hardware can truly be.&#39;,
 &#39;This reminds me of the wonderful novel &#34;The Bug&#34; by Ellen Ullman. A beautifully-written fictionalized account of the quest for a &#34;Holy Grail&#34; bug.&#39;,

 &#34;Here you can try to create your own solution to keeping global warming below 2°C: https://en-roads.climateinteractive.org/scenario.html?v=2.7.... (rabbit hole warning: you can easily spend hours playing with this site)It&#39;s not impossible to create solutions that don&#39;t require carbon capture, but those tend to have the uncomfortable side effect of raising electricity prices two- or three-fold in the next 20 years. But here is one that I created which keeps the prices stable and also achieves 2 degrees: https://en-roads.climateinteractive.org/scenario.html?p1=-1&amp;...&#34;,
 &#39;People are missing the fact that the oil and gas industry is strongly in favour of CCS for 2 main reasons:1.  It makes extracting and burning oil not so bad - no need to make rules limiting oil extraction, we can simply start some CCS projects.2. Injecting CO2 into deep oil wells actually helps get more oil out of them.    Get the government to pay for CCS, while the oil company profits off increased yields.&#39;,
 &#39;CCS is absolutely going to be necessary. So is nuclear.What is the renewable alternative for the cement, steel, shipping, and aviation industries?Environmentalists need to get out of their own way and stop treating good as the enemy of perfect. Some progress is better than no progress. All technologies and approaches will be required.https://mobile.twitter.com/Peters_Glen/status/11948866002552...&#39;,
 &#39;It\&#39;s worth pointing out the &#34;omg&#34; math moment in this paper. According to various mitigation scenarios modelled, the amount of CCS required (in addition to other mitigating approaches) requires the construction of an &#34;average typical&#34; CCS facility at a rate of between one a week, and one a day, until 2050.I\&#39;m not sure how to describe how this makes me feel, other than &#34;ill&#34;.&#39;,
 &#39;CCS technology is uneconomic.  Like incredibly uneconomic.  Like, the last thing you would pay for after doing all other possible things.  https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/stock/files/gillingham_sto...\nhttps://ourworldindata.org/how-much-will-it-cost-to-mitigate...&#39;,
 &#34;Plug for Project Vesta [1], which I donate to.  It&#39;s the only energy-practical proposal I&#39;ve seen so far for real carbon capture aside from replanting a million acres of trees and hoping people don&#39;t burn them... again.[1] https://projectvesta.org/&#34;,
 &#39;CC will probably never happen on the large scale. It is inherently inefficient and a final, last resort.Preventing emissions: Renewable electricity. EVs. Hydrogen. Synthetic food stuffs. EtcHandling the last 5%-10%: tax carbon, and allow nature to recover (rain forests, fisheries, natural bio-mass, etc).The idea of carbon capture while some developing country is cutting down forests is bizarre. Luckily population is stabilizing, and the world is getting richer and urbanized.&#39;,
 &#39;I think carbon capture is the way, I will soon do a show hn of our little company called carbonHarvester, we have as per as I know the cheapest technology of capturing the CO2 out of thin air, our aim is to enable anyone using an air conditioner to harvest CO2 from thin air with a little additional energy bill, and we can regenerate the captured CO2 cheaply.&#39;,
 &#39;This article has some good charts and visualizations.  Just to add one for context, this is from the IPCC SR15 report 2 years ago:https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/sites/2/2019/02/SPM3...The yellow sections are BECCS, which is basically burning biosmass for energy and then using CCS to capture the co2 from it.  That is to say, CCS has already been factored into the models as a necessary assumption for a long time now.Keep in mind this is completely distinct from using CCS for continued burning of coal/gas/oil, and absolutely not about using it for enhanced oil recovery.  Using CCS in those scenarios is like losing money on every unit sold and trying to make it up in volume, its simply bad math.&#39;,
 &#34;Surprising they include Direct Air Capture as CCS.Here&#39;s the more detailed 32 page PDF that accompanies the linked CCS article:\nhttps://pub.cicero.oslo.no/cicero-xmlui/bitstream/handle/112...I publish a weekly newsletter on carbon removal: \nhttp://bit.ly/carbon-updates&#34;,
 &#39;Highly recommend reading sustainable energy without the hot air by the late David MacKay. Even though dated, he really puts numbers behind every broad stroke assumption that causes pause&#39;,
 &#34;So who pays? Government isn&#39;t going to convince people to do it, or else they would have just implemented carbon taxes to begin with.&#34;,
 &#39;CCS can be a way to keep using fossil fuels for dispatchable supply, in a way that meshes nicely with renewables.In particular:  make hydrogen from the fossil fuel 24/7, store the hydrogen, sequester the CO2, and when needed burn the hydrogen in power plants (or other uses).&#39;,
 &#34;My intuition is that it would be almost always cheaper to pay e.g. Norway and Saudi Arabia to not pump out the captured carbon (in form of fossilized plant matter) in the first place, instead of pumping it out in the form of oil, burning it, then capturing the CO2, liquifying it and finally pumping it back underground where hopefully it doesn&#39;t bubble up again. But that would be the problem a world-wide carbon emission trade/carbon tax would solve...Weirdly, I always see oil nations such as Norway here or Saudi Arabia pushing for CCS, as if this solution would be in their interest... while really reducing CO2 emmissions for them would be as simple as pushing a stop button.&#34;,
 &#39;The best and cheapest way to capture carbon is to plant trees. Lots of them.&#39;,
 &#39;Title: &#34;Carbon Capture and Storage is necessary to keep global warming below 2°C&#34;\nIn the article: &#34;There are at least some scenarios that can meet the Paris goals without CCS.&#34;WTF ?!!&#39;,
 &#39;Perhaps we can reconsider recycling of paper products as a first step?If you send a paper bag to the landfill it\x92s buried in the ground (sequester), a tree is cut down to make a new paper bag, and a new tree is planted to make new material for more bags. Thus carbon is continuously captured from the air and buried deep.If you recycle a bag then the old tree dies of old age and decomposes releasing the captured carbon back into the air. The new tree repeats the cycle, with no net carbon capture.&#39;,
 &#34;Is there even just a small scale production implementation of carbon capture? Last I checked it wasn&#39;t even working in the lab beyond trivial scale.&#34;,
 &#39;Plant a billion trees; problem solved.&#39;,
 &#34;No, it&#39;s not necessary at all.It would also be uneconomical and therefore pointless. You might as well pay people to not work. Hey isn&#39;t that exactly the appeal of MMT? People could do nothing, emit less CO2 and still get paid.&#34;,
 &#39;Very helpful advice coming from a country that has run its whole economy off its oil reserves since the 80s.&#39;,

 &#34;I want to applaud you for making the most vanilla contribution in 114 years. It turns out that everyone who appears to care doesn&#39;t give a shit, and CCD doesn&#39;t matter, and neither does natural gas.

 &#39;Like many people, I have started toy OSes, and like most such projects, all of them but my current one did not make it far past the booting stage.The problem was that there was just too much to do: Booting, memory management, interrupt/exception handling, video output, keyboard, disc access, file systems, scheduling... most of those things are potentially interesting, but not all at once, and yet they are all pretty much necessary to get your OS to the &#34;critical mass&#34; where working on individual aspects starts being fun.Until I had the idea to not just boot using plain old 16bit DOS, but too also keep DOS running in my OS, as a task. The thing about DOS is that it is barely an &#34;operating system&#34; in the modern sense. Instead, it is more a crude collection of 16bit x86 routines that do most of the aforementioned things: Console input/output, file system access, crude memory management, a whole shell actually (COMMAND.COM)... and you can even load drivers for networking, sound, and almost everything else, provided for form of it already existed about 15 years ago.My current toy OS is a modern message passing microkernel, but for everything that I did not feel like implementing yet, I call into the DOS task. The task runs as a vm86 task, essentially within a hypervisor (called the &#34;vm86 monitor&#34;), but specifically for 16 bit real mode code. (64bit x86 got rid of the now obsolete vm86 mode, so there you would have to actually implement something much closer to a modern hypervisor.) This is done using using a shim layer that receives messages using the message passing system of my OS and translates them into the (usually) soft-interrupt driven DOS/BIOS function calls.This is possible with DOS, unlike modern OSes, because it\&#39;s such a crude and conceptually simple OS, centered around direct hardware access and with essentially no own memory protection/address space separation, that it just does not get in the way of implementing my own OS.&#39;,
 &#39;Just curious if someone has done OS dev in top down manner. That is, work within a modern multi-tasking OS like Windows or Linux and develop a collection of OS components (in the form of host OS modules?) that gradually replace functionality of the host OS? I imagine this would be much easier to do under Linux rather than Windows since the ABI/API for hooking into is open and documented. This way one can start developing just those components that interest you first, although I imagine key areas like memory management, scheduling and interrupts may not be replaceable from within a running OS?&#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s x86, isn&#39;t it? I&#39;d love to see something as small as this one that wouldn&#39;t rely as much on BIOS.The way I understand it, the following code is based one of the assumptions you can&#39;t make without x86 BIOS, can you?    /* video memory begins at address 0xb8000 */\n    char *vidptr = (char*)0xb8000;&#34;,
 &#34;Is there an &#39;Awesome&#39; list of simple OS kernels somewhere?&#34;,
 &#34;&gt; Literally billions of dollars have been invested in building systems like GPT-2, and megawatts of energy (perhaps more) have gone into testing themHuh, seems like the bot that produced the article lacks some understanding about the real world. Maybe it just needs more training until it learns to associate megawatts with power instead of energy.Meanwhile GPT2 completes this sentence to&gt; Literally billions of dollars have been invested in building systems like GPT-2, and megawatts of power generation to support this project.On a more serious note GPT2 doesn&#39;t learn, it can&#39;t iteratively explore the world, doesn&#39;t experience time or associate those words with other stimuli or anything like that. Given these and more limitations it&#39;s fairly impressive what it does. It&#39;s like a child reading advanced physics books without the necessary prior knowledge. Being able to form a coherent-seeming sentence of jargon is all you can expect from it. Of course the path to AGI is long.&#34;,
 &#39;&gt; What happens if I have four plates and put one cookie on each?&gt;&gt; I have four plates and put one cookie on each. The total number of cookies is [24, 5 as a topping and 2 as the filling]After playing around with AI dungeon for a bit I noticed that the types of mistakes I saw were very reminiscent of common logical errors in human dreams.For instance in dreams, clocks and signs are inconsistent from one glance to another, location can change suddenly, people come and go abruptly, sometimes I do things for reasons that don\&#39;t really make sense when I wake up... etc. Things just follow some sort of &#34;dream logic&#34;.&#39;,
 &#39;I don\&#39;t agree with the conclusion here. It\&#39;s all about the input data.GPT-2 is trained on words people actually write on the internet, which is an inherently incomplete dataset. It leaves out all the other information an &#34;intelligence&#34; knows about the world. We know what sources are authoritative, we know the context of words from the visual appearance of the page, and we connect it all with data from our past experiences, school, work, friends, our interaction with the world. Among a million other ways we get data.How would GPT-2 determine most facts from the input dataset? If the only thing you knew was all the text on the internet, with zero other context, you\&#39;d have no way of knowing what is &#34;true&#34;, or why that concept is important, or anything else. I bet you\&#39;d behave just like GPT-2.It\&#39;s a robot that is really good at writing, because that is all it knows. I think it doesn\&#39;t know anything about how to make sense on a macro scale because I don\&#39;t think the input data contains that information. It seems to do well when the input data contains relevant information.&#39;,
 &#39;This article doesn\&#39;t make much sense to me, although I admittedly am not familiar with linguistic theory.&gt; \&#39; One of the most foundational claims of Chomskyan linguistics has been that sentences are represented as tree structures, and that children were born knowing (unconsciously) that sentences should be represented by means of such trees.\&#39;I don\&#39;t understand how GPT-2 tests or attempts to refute this claim. Can\&#39;t we view children as being born with a pre-trained network similar to a rudimentary GPT?&gt; \&#39;Likewise, nativists like the philosopher Immanuel Kant and the developmental psychologist Elizabeth Spelke argue for the value of innate frameworks for representing concepts such as space, time, and causality (Kant) and objects and their properties (e.g spatiotemporal continuity) (Spelke). Again, keeping to the spirit of Locke\&#39;s proposal, GPT-2 has no specific a priori knowledge about space, time, or objects other than what is represented in the training corpus.\&#39;I\&#39;m just very confused. Are nativists arguing that these principles regarding language and &#34;innate frameworks&#34; aren\&#39;t emergent from fundamental interactions between neurons in the brain?It seems like either1. They are arguing these aren\&#39;t emergent, which seems obviously wrong if we\&#39;re trying to describe how language actually works in the brain, in which all thoughts are emergent from the interactions of neurons.2. They are arguing that they are emergent, but pre-encoded into every human that is born. This doesn\&#39;t seem inconsistent with GPT-2 at all.This article seems like a fine critique of our performance so far in language modeling, but in no way does it seem to be vindicating nativist views of language, nor do I quite understand how such views apply to GPT-2.Obviously, the idea that you can encode every thought in a fixed length vector is BS (just because thought space doesn\&#39;t have a fixed dimensionality it can be reduced to), but seems rather irrelevant to the main point of the article.&#39;,
 &#34;I completely agree with Marcus&#39; assessment of GPT-2 and its ilk. They are simply regurgitating words with zero understanding of any words/meaning.It seems that OpenAi and others are peddling this AI when its simply a glorified Eliza on steroids.&#34;,
 &#39;I just came here to say that&gt; Every person in the town of Springfield loves Susan. Peter lives in Springfield. Therefore he obviously has no love for that bitch.is an awesome completion.  I would read that short story.&#39;,
 &#39;https://nostalgebraist.tumblr.com/post/189965935059/human-ps... for an orthogonal point of view\x97-I feel Marcus is a bit too embroiled in this particular debate to make level-headed criticism on the merits/potential of GPT-2&#39;,
 &#39;It\&#39;s really weird to evaluate GPT-2 based on its ability to say things no reasonable person would ever say. If I were born in Cleveland I wouldn\&#39;t be jumping to proclaim my fluency in English. If I told you I left my keys out at the pub, I wouldn\&#39;t immediately repeat myself and say that my keys are now at the pub. If I\&#39;m talking about two trophies plus another trophy, I\&#39;d probably try to end it with some punchline rather than saying there\&#39;s three trophies.A lot of the things we write assume the reader can make connections on their own. That\&#39;s a writing skill. It\&#39;s the reason why Hemingway\&#39;s famous &#34;For sale: baby shoes, never worn&#34; is so impactful. As such I\&#39;ve found GPT-2 to be incredible at writing fanfiction.&#39;,
 &#34;The TLDR:- there are two opposing views about nature of human intelligence, nativism (that believe a fair deal of intelligence is already encoded in us when we are born, eg we are &#39;primed&#39; to learn language a certain way according to Chomsky) and empiricism (that believe we mostly learn things from scratch via experience)- GPT 2 is a recent mega large neural net trained on lots of data to take in a few words or sentences and predict which words are most likely to come next given that input. It was trained on absurdly huge amounts of data with absurdly huge amounts of compute at a fairly large cost.- GPT 2 is pretty impressive in many ways in that the stuff it predicts is syntactically correct, relevant to input, and very versatile (it can handle and complete text on any subject you can think of). But, its predictions often exhibit a lack of basic common sense.- Since it lacks common sense and a ton was invested it, the piece posits it is evidence in favor of &#39;empirical&#39; approaches to intelligence seemingly being wrong and alternatives being a good idea from now on.To be fair GPT-2 does have some innate built in structure (it&#39;s not just a fully connected neural net, it has the popular Transformer architecture which relies on the fairly recent idea of self attention as a core building block). And it&#39;s fair to argue that GPT-2 is just evidence training on word prediction conditioned on input is not enough to get to common sense; perhaps a different task/loss built on top of Transformer model would work just fine. But really the whole research project of Deep Learning has been an exercise in nativism (since most research is trying to find new and better neural net architectures, ie priors for learning, for various tasks), aside from OpenAI which is much bigger on just scaling existing stuff up, so this agrees with current AI trends more or less.&#34;,
 &#34;In a town there was a baker&#39;s son. The baker, Adrian Holmes, loved his son Terry. On the wedding day his son had to write his full name which was: _______. Terry told him that he had to write it very long with lots of apostrophes but that the baker would cut it and write in the name of another person. There was a wife of one of Terry&#39;s friends, who had a daughter named _______. Terry wrote out her name in the couple of lines of his name. Then he filled in the apostrophes and wrote the other name on. Then he wrote his own name. When he got home he put his papers away, copied _______&#39;s last name on to the papers and put them back in his pocket. He thenClearly, not long before humanity is hacked trying to make sense of this.&#34;,
 &#34;I&#39;m excited about future applications that strap this onto some relatively simple, logically consistent, non-AI number-crunching program.  As a toy example, Scott Alexander trained it to output chess moves in a consistent manner that avoids  nonsensical moves, but it can&#39;t win against competent human players.  If you strap it onto a chessbot during both training and use I&#39;m fairly sure it&#39;ll easily beat human grandmasters.So what you have here is a human compatibility/abstraction layer for programs.  What can you do with this strapped to Wolfram Alpha?  Or trained with a Github dataset?Put another way, apparently this does linguistic style /convincingly humanlike writing without being able to reason about cause/effect or basic arithmatics.  But we already have programs that does cause/effect and arithmetics, quickly and at 100% accuracy.  Now we just need to combine the two.&#34;,
 &#34;I kept reading that article thinking &#39;wow this is the lowest-quality post I&#39;ve seen on thegradient, must be different from previous authors&#39; and it turns out it&#39;s Gary Marcus.His agenda for constantly &#39;proving&#39; that AI doesn&#39;t really work is ramping up even faster than Deep Learning itself is..&#34;,
 &#39;I think he could have wrapped his paper up after showing this one example:&gt; (input) I put two trophies on a table, and then add another, the total number is (GPT-2 continuation) five trophies and I\&#39;m like, \&#39;Well, I can live with that, right?GPT-2 correctly inferred that the continuation should be a number of trophies, based on bazillions of similar sentences. But it had no understanding that arithmetic was called for. Despite the giant clues of &#34;add&#34; and &#34;total&#34;, it didn\&#39;t add 2+1 and continue &#34;three trophies&#34;. It was mindlessly oblivious to the clearly implied request for a sum. Therefore it did not &#34;understand&#34; the input at all, in any sense whatever.&#39;,
 &#39;I hate so much criticisms (even implied) around the amount of data that GPT-2 is trained on. 40GB of text is lots, but in terms of bits of information it\&#39;s very roughly the amount of information a human (say.. like an infant) sees in one day.The human eye processes information at around 9 megabit/second[1]. That is about 10 hours to process 40GB.Yes, text and visual information have completely different &#34;knowledge&#34; densities, and yes this ignores sound, touch, taste and smell bandwidth, and it also ignores concepts of imagination where humans simulate how things might occur.But I\&#39;d also note that it takes ~2 years before an infant learns to speak at all.I believe there is actual measurable evidence that the brain does have an implied structure for language, and I know there are some behaviours that are genetically passed down.But it takes lots of information (in terms of actual bit of information) to teach a human to do anything.If the Marcus argument is &#34;GPT-2&#34; isn\&#39;t general AI, then I doubt anyone will argue.If the Marcus argument is &#34;Neural Networks aren\&#39;t a route to general AI&#34; then we need to consider his definition of general AI (which doesn\&#39;t seem to exist) and his benchmarks (in the linked paper[2]) then what will happen in ~12 months when someone has a model that performs as well as humans? There are plenty of question answering models that will do better now than the raw text understanding models he tried.(As an aside, I love some of the answers some models came up with:  Question: Juggling balls without wearing a hat would be \n  GPT-2 Answer: easier with my homemade shield\n\n  Question: Two minutes remained until the end of the test. 60 seconds passed, leaving how many minutes until the end of the test? \n  GPT-2 Answer: Your guess is as good as mine\n\n)I do think the analysis section of the paper is interesting though.[1] https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn9633-calculating-the-...[2] https://context-composition.github.io/camera_ready_papers/Ma...&#39;,
 &#39;Well, the author learned the difference between syntax and semantics.&#39;,
 &#39;There is pretty much no actual evidence here and at least a few indications that they are not iOS forensics experts. Bezos did not choose the right company to handle this work.Some of their assumptions are really stretching, especially the bit about the picture of the woman looking vaguely like his girlfriend, as if that\x92s an indicator that they know about her. They seem to be working backwards from their conclusion and trying to stretch the evidence to the explain what they want to be true.I actually was more convinced that MBS was involved before reading the report. Now seeing this, plus the story that AMI paid her brother 200k for leaked texts that WSJ saw and verified, really has me doubting.&#39;,
 &#39;&gt; Due to end-to-end encryption employed by WhatsApp, it is virtually impossible to decrypt the contents of the downloader to determine if it contained any malicious code in addition to the delivered video.I can\&#39;t make any sense of that. The phone is the end in &#34;end-to-end&#34;. It contains the decryption keys. Why would &#34;the downloader&#34; be any different to decrypt than the video? Also they show a screenshot of the video being sent through WhatsApp... but they\&#39;re saying that the video was downloaded via some malicious executable? I would have thought the video would contain the malicious code. That makes no sense.&gt; Advanced weapons grade mobile malware typically installs itself to the root filesystem of a device to maintain persistence and avoid detection.This report sounds like bullshit. It sounds like they looked at the cellular data use, noticed an increase after this whatsapp message was sent, and did a bunch of random stuff they barely understood to fill out the report. Their list of &#34;forensic tools&#34; or whatever includes like... grep. And virutalbox. They also didn\&#39;t jailbreak the phone and look at the filesystem, so I\&#39;m not sure what they even looked at besides just sniffing the wifi traffic.EDIT: I reread the report. Jeff Bezos\&#39; phone was not hacked. They are claiming that a video attachment in whatsapp contained a malicious executable that gained full filesystem access to his iPhone based on absolutely nothing other than the fact that his cellular data upload increased. Most of that increase happened almost a year later. The guy just started using iCloud photo backups or sent someone videos via imessage or something. There are way simpler explanations for why the media got his text messages. Like, you know, the person he sent them to showed somebody.&#39;,
 &#34;That&#39;s a really long document to say that they weren&#39;t able to find much of anything.  They think his bandwidth usage went up for a long time after he got a WhatsApp message from MbS&#39; number and couldn&#39;t actually analyze any malware.  I have to wonder why they&#39;d hack him with a video flying their own flag.The thing about the women looking similar is really reaching and doesn&#39;t make any sense.  We already have other reports that Bezos&#39; GF showed texts to her brother who sold them from other reports.Finally, what&#39;s with really rich people sending their electronics to 3rd party security firms and not letting the Feds analyze anything directly?  You&#39;d think that if this was really some matter of national security or whatever, you&#39;d want an investigation by people with subpoena power.  But I guess that doesn&#39;t matter for some reason?&#34;,
 &#34;Two questions (which aren&#39;t really explained in this report):1. Did he have to actually play the video, or was simply receiving the message enough to compromise his phone?2. It says after his phone was compromised, a large amount of data was extracted from his phone. Was this only WhatsApp specific data (cached pics and videos from messages sent within the app) or did the malware actually have full access to all of the files on his phone?Because of iOS&#39;s sandboxing and permission system I would not have expected that a vulnerability in WhatsApp itself would be able to grant access to the entire phone. That seems like it would be much bigger news if it were the case.&#34;,
 &#39;This story has frustrated me from the very first Bezos blog post [1] as a fairly obvious counterintelligence operation.Now a year later the story has resurfaced and it\x92s all the same conspiracy theories based on nothing.This report demonstrates as clearly as you could hope that there was no real analysis and no real evidence of any of the absolutely extraordinary claims made by Besos and de Becker. [2]From what I can tell, the only reasonable conclusion is that this whole thing was a retaliatory attack on MBS and on AMI. Yet a year later, the news headlines are all parroting that the report proves MBS personally orchestrated this exploit.We are now at the point of theater of the absurd. This story has been a smoldering load of garbage from the very beginning. [3] I can\x92t believe it keeps coming around.The closest I can find to an honest accounting is this WSJ op-ed [4], which many here won\x92t like because it ties the totally flawed reporting on this story back to similar flaws in the Russiagate reporting. That is, a story the media wants to be true just a bit too badly.[1] - https://medium.com/@jeffreypbezos/no-thank-you-mr-pecker-146...[2] - https://www.thedailybeast.com/jeff-bezos-investigation-finds...[3] - \nhttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19535965https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19539943[4] - https://www.wsj.com/articles/jeff-bezos-tries-to-wag-the-dog...&#39;,
 &#39;Probably &#34;technical&#34; should be removed from the title.&#39;,
 &#39;They lost me at &#34;encrypted downloader&#34;. The WhatsApp video attachment format allows for...a downloader? I strongly doubt that.Perhaps what they should have written is that they cannot decrypt the video and thus check for an exploit within it (it\&#39;s commonly called payload, because it doesn\&#39;t have to be a downloader...).I see from other comments here that I am not the only one doubting the report wording at the very least.&#39;,
 &#39;This report is a pure, unadulterated, dumpster fire. No one is explaining how a video file is a trojan vector. Also this report has way too much background of the \x93Hacking Team\x94 that really sounds suspect from me. I just feel if you are trying to establish that this vector was the source of a trojan - youd actually prove that instead of giving a page or two of conjecture on where this code that you haven\x92t shown is malware - came from.Also, obligatory, correlation does not imply causation. This report hinges on the argument that \x93video received from MBS and shortly thereafter the total data egress increased\x94. Okay what data was egressed? Where was it egressed to? Just basic things are missing from this report that are relevant.Absolute garbage.&#39;,
 &#39;What does it mean that the malicious video was delivered via &#34;an encrypted downloader hosted on WhatsApp\&#39;s media server&#34;?&#39;,
 &#39;So the billionaires of this world, Bezos and MBS, exchange memes with photos of pretty girls. And Bezos reads The Daily Mail.\nJust like the rest of us, except having way more $$$.&#39;,

 &#39;This is interesting, privacy and security work both ways. Protecting us and our data and enabling malicious actors. I have turned off Auto Downloads on Whatsapp.&#39;,
 &#39;I don\&#39;t understand why they refer to the list of 192 URLs that all turned out to be legitimate as &#34;IOCs&#34;Why would a device reaching out to bing/wikipedia/medium be considered an indicator of compromise, or even a suspected IOC?&#39;,
 &#39;Well, no direct evidence, just co-timed egress data spikes, which no one noticed for 9 months. If there was a hack, it was a pretty successful one.&#39;,
 &#39;tl; dr: nothing is proven yet in either direction. The report acknowledges &#34;ongoing work&#34; is needed to root the phone.Maybe they should have waited to publish until they did that.&#39;,
 &#34;Don&#39;t read. Read comments and save your time.&#34;,
 &#39;by downloading the pdf, will my iphone get infected? :)&#39;,
 &#39;if this is true and MBS wants to silence Jeff Bezos just because his owned paper attacks him, mind you this paper just like every other major western paper attacks him day and night since the murder of the Saudi &#34;journalist&#34; so silencing one paper won\&#39;t make any difference anyway. Why would he send this infected video which is probably linked to a backdoor only a very few have knowledge about, from his own Whatsapp account not from some associate or a friend of Bezos who is in his contacts? This whole story doesn\&#39;t seem logical to me.&#39;,
 &#39;So another narcissist on the internet had his phone hacked. Big deal.&#39;,
 &#39;This was really boring from a security or forensics perspective. Nothing really substantial in there. But fortunately there are other angles to view this document from: if this is authentic, it says that the richest man on the entire planet......uses a two year old phone. I mean, I like my iPhone X too, but hey, if I had like north of 100 billion dollars, I would certainly spend about 1500 of those dollars for the newest iPhone generation every year (especially if my older generation has an unfixable bootloader bug compromising its entire security architecture)....exchanges silly meme pictures with ostensibly funny texts with his billionaire friends.&#39;,
 &#34;I find each new development in the field of deploying Kubernetes to be grimly humorous. We had lots of techniques to package and deploy things before Kubernetes, but they were complex and inadequate in some ways, and Kubernetes fixes some of those issues. But it turns out Kubernetes itself is substantially more complicated to package and deploy than the old solutions, if you&#39;re deploying it yourself rather than using some proprietary cloud. Oops!What I just can&#39;t decide is whether we&#39;ll successfully put another layer of container-container-containers on top of Kubernetes, or whether the whole effort will eventually collapse and we&#39;ll extract the good parts out into something simpler.&#34;,

 &#39;&#34;So the biggest change is that Oil will be based on strings (and arrays of strings) like shell&#34;I would advise the author have a look at the internals of Tcl, not because you should copy all the sophisticated features immediately, but because it demonstrates a way to have both &#34;everything is a string&#34; and &#34;advanced data structures&#34; in a relatively principled manner. You don\&#39;t have to start out with all the optimizations from day one but I always find it helpful to have a look down the road in cases like this, and make sure that if this sort of thing interests you that you don\&#39;t accidentally make it impossible later.&#39;,
 &#39;Mostly off topic, but I\&#39;ve never understood why shells are designed to have this weird dual use case of both being easy to type into a command prompt, and being easy to write 40+ line scripts in. Why does that need to have the exact same syntax? This is the root cause of why bash (and batch and etc etc etc) are so terrible to script in (and why powershell is so terrible to type into a terminal). This weird shit like [ being a command, and having to think long and hard about exactly when variables are replaced and when globs are executed and how errors happen.. It\&#39;s just pretty pointless.Like, if you write a script using Python or Ruby or Perl or whatever, there\&#39;s easy ways to call into the shell. Often it\&#39;s even built-in, like using backticks `echo like this`. These languages aren\&#39;t designed for shell scripting but even they are often easier and cleaner than a bash script. It could be much better thoughk I bet.I\&#39;d love to have a language that is easy and familiar to type into a terminal (and thus, sufficiently bash-like probably), while being significantly easier to write scripts in. You could require the script to have a bit more syntax, a bit more structure, but essentially have the same semantics as what you\&#39;d type on the command line, and you\&#39;d have the best of both worlds. If well designed, it\&#39;d still &#34;feel&#34; like the same thing (much like how all JS programmers immediately grokked Coffeescript when it came out, because it really was just JS); everything you\&#39;d learn on the command line, you\&#39;d be able to apply in a script and vice versa. The script would just require more structure and thus provide more comfort (good error messages, editor support, etc).For example, globbing. The idea that the shell expands &#34;.foo&#34; into a list of files, before evaluating the command, is handy, but it\&#39;s also an enormous footgun. What if on the terminal it would do that, but when scripting, you\&#39;d be required to write `glob(&#34;.foo&#34;)` or else it\&#39;d error out? THat would force you to clearly control when the expansion happens, it would let you assign it to a variable in a readable way etc. Imagine similar stuff for argument lists, escaping, variable substitution, etc - all the magic available on terminal, but contained in the script.Does this exist? I\&#39;d love to have it.&#39;,
 &#34;not only is this an extremely exciting project that I&#39;ve been following for what feels like years, but there is such a tremendous richness of stuff only tangentially related to the project that the author has collected as well (one example: https://github.com/oilshell/oil/wiki/ExternalResources). this is clearly such a well-organized, thoughtful endeavor that i have absolute faith that great things will come of it. and he&#39;s an excellent writer to boot!&#34;,
 &#39;I\x92m looking forward to the post mentioned towards the end, detailing the cutting of features. I\x92ve been following the work on this for ages and was looking forward to types data as a way to guard against accidental mistakes, so I\x92m keen to read the author\x92s reasoning for switching to strings and arrays of strings. I\x92m sure there\x92s a non-trivial reason, his work has always felt careful, measured and well though out to me.&#39;,
 &#34;&gt; Replace the world&#39;s usage of bash.I feel like this is hardest part. Bash is installed everywhere, and that ubiquity is one of its greatest assets. Oil can\x92t replicate that (at least not for a very long time).&#34;,
 &#39;This kind of reminds me of Ammonite: https://ammonite.io/#Ammonite-Shell which definitely for a different audience but kind of a blend of being a Scala repl and somewhat-usage shell with several common commands being implemented as JVM functions with sensible types.&#39;,
 &#39;Good luck Chubot! If you release in 2020 I look forward to using it.&#39;,
 &#39;&gt;What languages and tools does Oil aim to &#34;replace&#34;?\n&gt;bash, awk, make, Python 2What will in fact happen: It says here on your resume that you know bash, awk, make, and python 2, but do you know Oil as well?&#39;,
 &#34;Author here.. Just as a preview of the next release of this, I&#39;ve been teaching it how different pins of the arduino can be used. Some pins support digital IO, some also PWM, some analog input pins also support digital IO, but others don&#39;t.So I can write a program like this and pick pins to use essentially at random:    import Copilot.Arduino.Uno\n    \n    main :: IO ()\n    main = arduino $ do\n        pwm pin2 =: longer_and_longer\n        delay =: constant 10\n\nAnd without even needing to load it into a board, let alone hook up wires, the compiler can tell me it won&#39;t work:   demo2.hs:5:9: error:\n    \x95 This Pin does not support PWM\n    \x95 In the first argument of \x91(=:)\x92, namely \x91pwm pin2\x92\n      In a stmt of a &#39;do&#39; block: pwm pin2 =: longer_and_longer\n\nThis is implemented using type level lists and type level programming, and user-defined type error messages.&#34;,
 &#39;When I first met arduino (and quickly more embedded boards afterwards), the hard part was not C[++], nor a toolchain around it \x96 I\x92m a C guy since \x9100. It was the fact that this area has few de-facto standards on how things should cooperate. Basic tutorials have no notion of event loops, you just for-loop forever and poll pins. But once I\x92ve got few non-standard devices, like that pressure sensor I got somewhere in the city, it all falls apart, because e.g. the time required to talk to it via provided library consumes enough cycles for your entire process to be late on physics. And vice versa, your logging is not async and interferes with signal timeouts. You simply spend tens-thousands of cycles spin-locking on i/o and there is no way to fix that without rewriting \x93drivers\x94 under some \x93os\x94. Idk if haskelling everything could help with that.I decided to just move on to high-mhz stm\x92s or even -pi variants, where a whole different stratum of software lives (seemingly), but luckily project folded for unrelated reasons. My conclusion was that if you\x92re a software developer, don\x92t just go embedded, it is not what you used to and routes you can take are limited.Edit: obviously missing some details here, and it was 7 years ago, would like if someone would elaborate on the state of the embedded world today.&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m not familiar with Haskell and functional programming in general, so I&#39;m curious if these codes in the OP make sense to Haskell people? Every lines of the codes are full of side effects (LEDs, buttons, delay...) and completely procedural.&#34;,
 &#39;Trying to keep an open mind here about this - but what does Haskell offer on an _arduino_ aside from developer preference?Surely C/C++ will be the better performer on such a tiny board... And usually you want to squeeze every drop of performance out of tiny boards&#39;,
 &#39;This looks like a great system to simplify Arduino programming.However, this runs your program in a loop. You can add a delay to reduce power consumption, but it will reduce responsiveness. I am really looking for interrupt-based Arduino programming.&#39;,
 &#39;That looks pretty cool. Is there some comparison table exists about binary size, memory usage etc against other languages?&#39;,
 &#39;.&gt;&#34;It was developed for NASA by Galois and is intended for safety-critical applications. So it\&#39;s neat to be able to repurpose it into hobbyist microcontrollers. (I do hope to get more type safety added to Copilot though, currently it seems rather easy to confuse eg miles with kilometers when using it.)&#34;I do hope that the km/m confusion is in the NASA version.&#39;,
 &#34;This shit is everywhere and I&#39;ve lately observed that the big outdoor brands aren&#39;t even close to doing what they can to stop using them. It&#39;s even in childrens clothes, all in the name of keeping us dry.I actually recently tried Greenland wax on a cotton canvas anorak, and so far it&#39;s working out great. Perhaps it&#39;s not as effective as Gore-Tex. I think we should try to remember that people somehow survived outside before these materials were introduced.&#34;,
 &#34;The fungi Phanerochaete chrysosporium and Aspergillus niger apparently can degrade PFAS chemicals. Though I&#39;m not sure how you concentrate them enough to for bioremediation, especially in tap water, unless you can do it at the point sources.https://escholarship.org/uc/item/2x47296bScotchguard got banned years ago, sounds like ski wax is next, but it sounds like it&#39;ll still be used in factories for the foreseeable future.&#34;,
 &#34;Seems like kind of weird timing for this article - FIS has banned fluoros, and their grip over the nordic ski racing world is pretty much absolute.  by next season, any waxes with fluoros will not be viable consumer products.They call out the american birkie for not having banned fluoros yet - that&#39;s because the FIS ban hasn&#39;t gone into effect yet.  American Birkie is a FIS worldloppet race and subject to FIS rules.&#34;,
 &#39;It\x92s in almost all chain lubes for bikes also. There is one brand I found called Green Oil that doesn\x92t use it, but it takes a week or so to ship from the UK and they only make a wet lube. Not thrilled with using a wet lube year round, but still much better than having Teflon dust in my apartment.&#39;,
 &#39;As someone who has waxed with HF wax several dozen times in the past (collegiate nordic ski racer) with no face mask and mediocre room ventilation, how worried should I be about long-term side effects?&#39;,
 &#39;For everyone concerned about the damage this crap is doing to the environment and humans should watch &#34;The Devil We Know&#34;[1]. This film covers a time frame, starting in the 50\&#39;s up to the current day.[1] https://youtu.be/gwZSXdjAqSk&#39;,
 &#39;This stuff is in drinking water which seems bad, but what are the dangers of Teflon and Gore-Tex clothing?&#39;,
 &#39;Meanwhile in Aspen, CO https://www.aspentimes.com/news/aspen-skiing-co-among-those-... &amp; https://www.dpsskis.com/phantom-glideShould pollute less because it lasts longer?&#39;,
 &#39;So is the regular Swix CH7 hydrocarbon wax a C6 or a C8? Should I still be handling these with gloves?&#39;,
 &#34;I am a childless person living in the biggest nordic skiing area in North America.  I wax with LF/HF every morning.  I don&#39;t think my impact on the environment is that big.&#34;,
 &#34;I was very interested in reasonml and had high hopes it would gain a lot of traction, but for an outsider, there doesn&#39;t seem to be a lot of activity on reasonml itself, the last release is from 18 months ago and if I&#39;m not mistaken, there&#39;s no public repo of reasonml itself.  Despite this you see projects like onivim 2 and esy using it, making me wonder if I&#39;m missing something. Anyone here knowing what the state of reasonml development is?&#34;,
 &#39;Reason/OCaml is truly a secret weapon, beating the averages and all. The reach this language has is incredible. Whether you work on React UIs, REST/GraphQL servers, desktop apps, Unix systems programming, or even unikernels, it never feels like the wrong tool for the job and is always fun all the way through.&#39;,
 &#39;Unikernels... is that what they mean by \x93full stack\x94! I thought it would be just JS and some kinda web server.&#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s worth noting that although OCaml give you the very cool option of deployment with unikernels, it&#39;s perfectly possible (and more straightforward) use regular binaries or containerised binaries instead.&#34;,
 &#34;OP here. MSL is a new language for representing research and text editing as programming language expressions. Our company&#39;s goal is to replace the word processor with an improved set of tools based on this language.The history of MSL can be traced from the goals of computer science pioneers going back to the 1940&#39;s. These additional documents further explain the development process and goals of the MSL language:Mimix Whitepaper.[0] Explains the historical precedents for moving beyond word processing.Getting to Xanadu.[1] Explains why Nelson&#39;s Xanadu did not achieve commercial success.Everything Old Isn&#39;t New Again (Yet).[2] Shows previous attempts at moving beyond word processing.Recipes for Research.[3] Explains how a new language could record text editing and fact changes over time.Nebula: Simple and Flexible Apps with (msl) Data. [4] Shows how (msl) applications can be deployed.I welcome your questions, ideas, and suggestions.-- D[0] https://mimix.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/On-Mimix-v1.3.pd...[1] https://mimix.io/getting-to-xanadu/[2] https://mimix.io/retro/[3] https://mimix.io/recipes/[4] https://mimix.io/nebula/&#34;,
 &#34;A more accurate title would be &#39;MSL: A Lisp-like stream-based data format for history of text based on a hierarchical key-value store&#39;.The idea behind the format is that analysis can be done on it to uncover useful insights about the text.&#34;,
 &#39;OP here, again. Thanks to everyone who read and commented! To answer a couple of questions:Mimix doesn\&#39;t force to you reveal everything included in your work (&#34;how the sausage was made&#34;); it\&#39;s simply there if you want to. This feature is mostly for you, the author, to get to your &#34;ah-ha&#34; moments as Vannevar Bush called them. Right now, we don\&#39;t have software that does a good job of connecting facts inside documents.MSL is a language for building tools which we hope can eventually replace the word processor. We are at an early stage with that software which will be open sourced once it\&#39;s ready.The hybrid database on which MSL relies could be viewed as the ultimate version control system because it allows rewinding any single variable (a semantic assignment statement) to any value it had in its history.Mimix certainly draws from the semantic web, but that\&#39;s not our secret sauce. Today, Google and Stanford already have good libraries for figuring out what is a noun, what is a verb, etc. Where MSL shines is, as @MiniMax42 pointed out, in marking up that text so that it can later be analyzed or transformed in ways that are difficult with word processing documents.While we hope to see this technology become ubiquitous, the best early use case is high-value documents like medical, scientific, legal and financial papers, as @jpalomaki said.Thanks again!\n-- D&#39;,
 &#39;Minix seems to be a system that incorporates word processing, AI-based (machine learning?) fact checking and bibliography management. Is MSL a language for interacting with that system or something more?Edit: *Mimix&#39;,
 &#34;Interesting work.How is MSL related to the concept of version control/revision control? I didn&#39;t see any reference to (centralized or decentralized) VCS, but that seems highly relevant to MSL.&#34;,
 &#39;This is an exciting idea.  I would hope that we can ultimately dispense with annotation and have the computer simply read the sentence and comment, or implement, or what have you.&#39;,
 &#39;In my island province here in Canada the biggest animal was the red fox (vulpes vulpes) until about ten years ago. Then suddenly coyotes appeared seemingly overnight. It drove foxes into the towns and cities or killed them off in rural areas.It\&#39;s amazing to witness such a sudden change although I\&#39;ve read they arrived in 1983. It\&#39;s very densely populated here but also rural it\&#39;s many small towns spread out plus two bigger cities. Coyotes were easily spotted since they stood out compared to a fox or even a dog.It\&#39;s not really a true coyote it\&#39;s canis latrans or the &#34;eastern coyote&#34;, or &#34;coywolf&#34;. They\&#39;re bigger than a true coyote, they\&#39;re smarter, and they live in packs of a dozen.The Coywolf is also more dangerous than a coyote or wolf. There are reports from people who were out walking and upon seeing a large dog they turned back around. When walking back they discovered they were being herded into a trap of several Coywolves. One woman in Cape Breton was killed by Coywolves when she was out for a walk in a wooded area.&#39;,
 &#39;Other than eating the occasional housecat (which is bad) Coyotes, in general, seem like good partners for our current urban/suburban life. They make hidden dens in our parks, like to eat rats and other small rodents and are scared of dogs and households.https://www.npr.org/sections/krulwich/2010/12/08/131876027/6...&#39;,
 &#39;Fascinating article, highlighting that the coyote is one of the few species to thrive in the Anthropocene. How do such populations cross significant barriers such as the Panama Canal? I could imagine a coyote or two crossing, but how do enough breeding pairs cross?&#39;,
 &#39;The interesting question is why did not happened before. This would suggest that big felines are retreating (and that coyotes trive in urban areas of course)The golden jackal in the same way is returning to its old domains in Europa, for some reason is a global trend. Maybe control of distemper has triggered something, or maybe climate is more accurate now for they.&#39;,
 &#39;&#34;Then, around the turn of the 20th century, nature\x92s barriers began to crumble. Forests began to fragment,&#34;It\&#39;s impressive how wrong that statement is. 1900 is when forests stopped fragmenting, not when they started. Between 1630 and 1900 forested area of north America declined from 46 percent to 34 percent. That declined only slightly to 33 percent in 1997 and has since increased to 36.2 percent.&#39;,
 &#39;This is not unusual, at least on large timescales. Life finds a way.If you want to read about larger migrations have a look at The Great American Biotic Exchange.https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2987556/&#39;,
 &#39;We\x92ve had them roaming through the middle of the city of Houston for well over a dozen years.  This local news article from a couple months ago has tips for how to handle them in your yard:https://www.khou.com/mobile/article/news/local/urban-coyotes...&#39;,
 &#34;Coyotes are on my lawn regularly. Once there was a litter of seven, that dwindled to 5 by the fall. They liked to play in the yard.I never bothered them, they didn&#39;t bother me, though they&#39;d watch me carefully.There&#39;s an eagle nest nearby, and the eagles are often circling above.Amazingly, I live in the middle of the city.&#34;,
 &#39;No problem. We simply unleash wave after wave of Chinese needle snakes.&#39;,
 &#39;&#34;The crab-eating fox and the coyote may soon swap territories, initiating the first American cross-continental exchange in more than three million years&#34;If you don\&#39;t count humans&#39;,
 &#34;Ok so apparently they would have to get through the equatorial (Amazon) forest firstMy bet is that it&#39;s not going to happen. It&#39;s not really a place where that kind of animal will thrive&#34;,
 &#39;I thought it was only the repulsive rats that benefit from the human ever-expanding footprint. Interesting to know other species are also adjusting.&#39;,
 &#39;This appears to be a mediocre piece of undergrad &#34;research&#34;, which is to say, the theoretical material is entirely plagiarized without citation. Even the applied analysis (Beethoven\&#39;s 9th, 2nd mvt. mm. 143-172) is directly lifted from another work.The application of group-theoretical ideas to music theory (in particular, the rules underpinning voice leading) is quite interesting, however! People have been interested in the link between symmetry and musical beauty since the time of the Pythagoreans. Looking through the modern lens of group theory shows a delightful simplicity: if you look at the world of musical operations in this way, the ones that sound best are often small deviations away from maximum symmetry.There are far better places to start, if you\&#39;re interested, covering much of the same (plagiarized!) material:https://www.math.drexel.edu/~dp399/musicmath/algebraicmusict...https://sites.math.washington.edu/~morrow/336_09/papers/Ada....https://alpof.wordpress.com/category/music/math-music/neo-ri...http://www-personal.umd.umich.edu/~tmfiore/1/mathmusiccolloq...https://www.maa.org/sites/default/files/pdf/upload_library/2...Or, of course, follow the citation chains on Wikipedia:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Riemannian_theory\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformational_theory&#39;,
 &#34;Was just reading on this topic while learning Arvo Pärt&#39;s Spiegel im Spiegel, and couldn&#39;t help interpret it as being heavy on critical-woo and light on functional analysis.(see linked papers mystical treatment of a for loop.)People talk about his Tintinnabuli style as being algorithmic and generated, but this particular paper wasn&#39;t persuasive, and reading the score while listening to it, I don&#39;t think it is. There are probably some symmetries encoded in his work, given how demanding they are on your attention, but the idea of discovering hidden meaning is itself superstitious.https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271513800_Mathemati...or if link is down:http://xn--urnalai-cxb.lmta.lt/wp-content/uploads/2014/11lie...However, the idea of reasoning about relationships and intent in music could have some applications to reasoning about code, and machine language and behaviour in particular. So I&#39;m not entirely dismissive of the poster, just a bit wary of some of the baggage the ideas may have collected along the way.&#34;,
 &#39;The &#34;complex&#34; math in this poster disguises the simplicity of these chords and transitions.. If you\&#39;re really interested in music theory (and why those transitions sound the way they do), &#34;The Songwriting Secrets of The Beatles&#34; is one of the best sources available today.https://www.amazon.com/Songwriting-Secrets-Beatles-Dominic-P...&#39;,
 &#39;It looks like the author is applying Set Theory [1] and concepts from 12-Tone [2] to tonal music. It is an interesting exercise - though I would expect that this music essentially boils down to &#34;Tonic -&gt; Domainant&#34; relationships. Schenker would be proud :)[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory_(music)\n[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve-tone_technique&#39;,
 &#34;So many recent ones from mosquitoes, dengue or chikungunya.More than almost any other near future technology, I hope for humanity&#39;s sake we quickly perfect a way to eradicate that demon insect.&#34;,
 &#34;I find it hard to get perspective on how devastating and society affecting the Spanish Flu was. Fifty to a hundred million. Dead. 3-5% of the world&#39;s humans gone. More from the prime of life than typical for disease.  This on tail end of World War One which also killed many more young men.History we should remember.&#34;,
 &#34;Doesn&#39;t mention the mysterious sleeping sickness epidemic of the early 20th century [0]. I learned of it through Oliver Sacks&#39; writings. Survivors were afflicted by a permanent neurological change:&gt; They would be conscious and aware \x96 yet not fully awake; they would sit motionless and speechless all day in their chairs, totally lacking energy, impetus, initiative, motive, appetite, affect or desire; they registered what went on about them without active attention, and with profound indifference.I can&#39;t help but be reminded of the current wave of chronic fatigue. I feel that modern doctors are too... hubristic? to find novel treatments for this like L-dopa.[0]: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encephalitis_lethargica&#34;,
 &#39;No mention of the Tudor Sweating Sickness, as mentioned in Wolf Hall a dramatisation if Thomas Cromwell:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweating_sicknessI would of thought some bodies could be exhumed an analysed as to what it might have been.This was in the thousands, is there a reason why it\x92s not on the list?&#39;,
 &#39;The yearly typical flu is not included while it easily kills a lot more than every other one in that list... So this is heavily biased.&#39;,
 &#39;if you were a particularly sinister CCP official, might you consider releasing a virus on purpose to quell the riots in HK? i have no evidence for this but from a cui bono perspective, it would be a diabolically efficient plan with some plausible deniability.&#39;,
 &#34;&gt; I\x92m struck here by an analogy to the Linux kernel. Kernel developers often use \x93time to build the kernel\x94 as a go-to benchmark when proposing kernel optimizations, because it\x92s a performance-intensive benchmark that every kernel developer, by construction, has readily at hand. Not coincidentally, the Linux kernel is drastically faster than any other production kernel I know of for certain operations that kernel builds exercise heavily, such as filesystem lookups. I think there\x92s a general lesson here that converting some desirable system property into a direct personal pain point for developers of the system creates very powerful feedback loops to ensure that property.Nice observation. It&#39;s a generalization of how devs with slow computers write more efficient code.&#34;,
 &#34;As an aside, it&#39;s amazing how much work Stripe has put into Sorbet. More than half of the ~100 contributers work at Stripe: https://github.com/sorbet/sorbet/graphs/contributors&#34;,
 &#39;Tangentially related but what is the experience of introducing Sorbet into an existing Ruby codebase? How does it compare to rewriting Javascript code to Typescript? Does it provide benefits quickly or only after the whole thing is typed? Are there many gems already typed?&#39;,
 &#39;&gt; These tests include fuzz testing, as well as running a \x93shadow build\x94 in Stripe\x92s CI that runs over every pull request to the monorepo, but reports failures only to the Sorbet developers, instead of to the PR author.What a great idea!&#39;,

 &#34;&gt; An important theorem in dimensional analysis is the Buckingham p theorem, which states that the laws of physics do not depend on the choice of a specific system of measurement.That&#39;s not what the Buckinham pi theorem states. The Buckingham pi theorem is a statement about the functional dependencies of dimensionally homogeneous equations. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_%CF%80_theoremI guess the writer mirrored some language on Wikipedia which indicated that the physical laws being independent of the choice of units is a consequence of the theorem.Anyway, I don&#39;t mean to detract from what otherwise appears to be an interesting and comprehensive summary of dimensional homogeneity checking in programming languages.&#34;,
 &#39;Java provides exceptional dimensional and unit support via the Manifold framework [1].    Length distance = 100 mph * 3 hr;\n    Force f = 5.2 kg m/s/s; // same as 5.2 N\n    Mass infant = 9 lb + 8.71 oz;\n\n[1] https://github.com/manifold-systems/manifold/tree/master/man...&#39;,
 &#39;I implemented this in C++ for a commercial game engine many years ago.  Both internally, and in the API used by games on top.We used Emacs-Lisp to generate a collection of C++ classes with all of the arithmetic operaters that were allowed, and only those.  &#34;friend&#34; is your friend for this in C++.We mostly used floating point to represent values, but could also use integers with scale factors (automatically applied in the operators), which is nearly equivalent to fixed point.For things where vectors made sense, 1d, 2d and 3d vector types were available.  So Position2d and Position3d.Absolute and relative values were distinguished: You could substract two absolutes to get a relative, but you couldn\&#39;t add two absolutes.  You could add a relative to an absolute to get an absolute.And for time intervals we used wraparound arithmetic and comparisons, like the Linux kernel has the time_before() macro, so absolute times could continue &#34;growing&#34; without overflow in a running game.Using the classes looked like a bit like this:    Position3d p1, p2;\n    Direction3d d = p2 - p1;\n\n    Absolute_Time t1, t2;\n    Time_Interval t = t2 - t1;\n\n    Velocity3d v;\n    object.set_position(p1 + t * v);\n\nThese types were used pervasively throughout all the game engine, gameplay logic, &#34;AI&#34; and so on.The constraints provided great type-checking and effectively documented a lot of code as well.This being a game engine, they had to be fast.  So they were all inline methods, in classes containing just a number, or up to 3 numbers for vectors.Using GNU C++ this compiled down to the same machine code as if we hand-coded the arithmetic in the traditional way; we checked.  So there was no runtime cost.It was very satisfying to use.&#39;,

 &#39;Ask HN: why does HN allow moans disguised as questions?Nothing productive will come of this topic.&#39;,
 &#39;just use incognito mode to read medium articles&#39;,
 &#39;Living across the street from the old factory in Berlin that was going to house a Google office until the local anti-gentrification movement started to protest, I\&#39;m not surprised. If you build a factory around here, with as much publicity as Tesla gets, you are going to see protests. There are probably two rare species of mosquitos being released in that forest right now.But just the existence of opposition isn\&#39;t very meaningful. Of a few million people, some will oppose manna raining from heaven.Does this have a chance to derail the project? Absolutely not!Germany is getting quite nervous of its car industry doing an impressive 4-way re-enactment of Nokia\&#39;s fate, and a significant Tesla presence is just about the best thing imaginable. The local politicians here in Berlin and Brandenburg (the state surrounding Berlin that includes the actual factory) are even more motivated, because it (still) lacks industry. Not one of the top-30 public companies in Germany is located in the east, for example.It\&#39;s also important to mention that the concept of &#34;protests&#34; has significant different meaning here than elsewhere, especially the US: A protest is seen as one method/venue/institution among the many that make up &#34;civil society&#34;. It carries no connotation of lawlessness[0], and any average citizen, even the blandest centrist, will attend many protests during their life. It\&#39;s often a social event as well, and can include entertainment, somewhat similar to parades in the US.0: some specific protests, like May Day, tend(ed) to involve some violence. But these number in the single digits, while there are 15 protests per day on average, just in Berlin.&#39;,
 &#34;Tesla has an long uphill battle trying to get it&#39;s factory built in Berlin. I also feel they&#39;re probably underestimating the seriousness with which Germans take their worker&#39;s rights.&#34;,
 &#34;While the water issue is, indeed, quite serious, I&#39;m not exactly sure why the &#39;increased traffic on highway&#39; is so much of a concern that it&#39;s raised in the same article. Yes, traffic will increase because more people will be coming to newly created job opportunities. I suppose some of the worries might be due to the equipment being moved by big trucks which could inflict infrastructural damage but this is solvable.&#34;,
 &#34;I&#39;m curious how German engineering and the Tesla&#39;s american engineering will work together. Especially in light of the Opel &amp; Focus experiences.&#34;,
 &#39;These are just your run off the mill NIMBYs. Many of those are way past their employment age, just take a look at the pictures. There was also a counterprotest.&#39;,
 &#39;There also were protests in favor of Gigafactory 4:https://twitter.com/Gf4Tesla/status/1218566354116149254https://twitter.com/Gf4Tesla/status/1218526931655761920&#39;,
 &#39;Tesla should just build another factory in China. Why bother w manufacturing in the EU?&#39;,
 &#39;Interesting to see the PR greenwashing marketing claims of Tesla clashing with their real life polluting activities.&#39;,
 &#39;Would it be possible to build a floating (or submerged) factory in the ocean? Far enough from shore but linked to a coastal city via a &#34;boring company&#34; tunnel. And thus be outside of any political jurisdiction.&#39;,
 &#34;What&#39;s changed since the last time this was posted: APL is now generally free.  J[1] is GPL.  The newest version of k is closed-source, but still freely available for personal use from shakti[2], and there is also an independent AGPL implementation[3].  Dyalog APL[4] is closed-source but free for personal use; and, finally, GNU APL[5] has always been open-source, but it&#39;s matured quite a bit.  Whatever your choice, you have a freely usable option.1: https://www.jsoftware.com/2: https://shakti.com/3: https://bitbucket.org/ngn/k/src/master/4: https://www.dyalog.com/5: https://www.gnu.org/software/apl/&#34;,
 &#39;A very nice introduction for mere mortals to J is here:Fly Straight, Dammit!http://www.petecorey.com/blog/2019/08/12/fly-straight-dammit...and here:A Shallow Introduction to the K Programming Languagehttps://web.archive.org/web/20130801233812/http://www.kuro5h...&#39;,
 &#39;A thread from 2015: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9707075Discussed at the time: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6115727&#39;,
 &#39;The comments are descriptive.&#39;,
 &#39;Added to my bookmarks, thanks. I especially respect the guy after he lashed out at the PC virtue signaller in the comments. How insufferable do people need to get to bitch about gender in an article about programming languages?&#39;,
 &#39;So in 1988 the research was robust, plentiful, and clear. What happened since?I went threw primary, secondary, and tertiary education between 1998 and 2018. If there was any use of spaced repetition in my education it was not apparent to me. It was never recommended to me as a study technique, even though \&#39;flashcard study\&#39; was recommended often.The 9 impediments discussed are not considered strong enough to be &#34;discouraging&#34;, but 30 years later spaced repetition isn\&#39;t part of standard western pedagogy and it has no significant mindshare. The only place it seems to have decent uptake amongst students is in Medical school.&#39;,
 &#39;I am fortunate. My snailmailbox is right next to the recycling bin, so it takes all of 15 seconds to sort through my mail and toss the junk into the bin.I still wish I could automate that like I can for email, though!&#39;,
 &#39;Because they are businesses and paper mail ads work&#39;,
 &#39;If a company acts to suppress &amp; hurt a community then attempts to participate in said communities events, they should be ejected from said event.Pride organizers need to grow a pair and start kicking companies and orgs that have abused LGBTQ+ people to the curb. If said org tries to pull a Salvation Army, they should be publicly put on notice like the Greater Seattle Business Alliance did: https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/as-salvation-army-...Actions speak louder than words, we have to fight back against PR that conveys lies.&#39;,
 &#39;This article feels like a big reach. Airbnb wants to keep its platform from being used for sex work (in my opinion this is understandable as once a platform begins allowing &#34;sex stuff&#34; it easily gets pigeonholed into being that platform - think Tumblr or Craiglist personals). So their algorithms to prevent advertisement for sex work caused at least one false positive. This, according to the author, means we now have social credit scores a la Black Mirror. (and was the vandalism at the end really necessary?)&#39;,
 &#39;This has been true for at least 2 years now, but readers here should have realized this in the past year. I am shocked this is on the front page of Hacker News.&#39;,
 &#39;It sounds like AirBnb is just trying to prevent someone\x92s home from becoming a whorehouse, or the set of a porn film.&#39;,
 &#39;Sophisticated stuff - and accessible by authorities. Still, optinion is CHINAAA BAAAAAD&#39;,
 &#39;https://archiveofourown.org/works/3673335 is the inevitable companion.&#39;,
 &#39;Hilarious!  Wish it had gone on another 10 pages.&#39;,
 &#39;I just remembered something related to what\&#39;s discussed in this article. Back in the 90\&#39;s someone discovered that taking a box of Dixie stir sticks and aiming the holes toward one of your ears would create really bizarre effects in your head.First of course is the &#34;eardrum suck&#34; but there are also some other interesting illusory effects. I actually managed to find that very page about it: http://amasci.com/freenrg/audhole.htmlPeople often feel disoriented and &#34;stuffy&#34; when they enter a sound proof room, like a recording studio or hearing test booth, or in a stadium, calm snow fall, etc where you don\&#39;t hear echo / reverb of your own voice and other things around you. It\&#39;s the same illusion again. Your brain really wants to experience the room ambiance, and gets funky when that information is missing.&#39;,
 &#34;I have a 3 year old pair of QC 35 (I), and actually prefer the ANC sensation and lack of city noises. I really do prefer this model from the dozens I tried precisely because their ANC seems be the strongest/best currently available. I don&#39;t see any advantage in the QC 35 II, only disadvantages with mandatory Google/Alexa. I&#39;m not married to any particular brand.Also, I&#39;ve gone through 9-10 pairs of ear cushions. The first 3 I got free (which retail for an insane $35 each), and the rest I bought from AliExpress in bulk for $6 each, which are 80% as good as the originals.The QC 35 really hates moisture. Ever since one episode where they got a bit too damp, any amount of humidity now causes one ear cup to whine/hum at a low volume before exploding to full, deafening, microphone-speakers PA-system-like feedback right in your ear. I suspect some corrosion/intermittent short on the PCB and I&#39;ll go full Louis Rossmann if it gets worse or the battery degrades too much. I&#39;m not handing $400 to Bose, Apple or anybody every 2 years because of their greedy cash-grabbing engineering products to fail/be avoidably fragile. (Tim Cook really ruined basically ALL consumer electronics, small and major appliances because said brands who cargo-culted Apple&#39;s approach now treat customers like idiots, hiked prices on their over-designed, over-engineered, under-tested products. I just saw a CBC video on kitchen appliance in Canada and customers keep buying crappy, defect models in droves that fail just outside of the warranty. That looks like a Lemon Law class-action lawsuit waiting to happen IYAM. The original MBPs and the ones from 2012-2013 were fairly well-made and upgradable.)&#34;,
 &#39;Wow, I just discovered that people dislike this sensation\x97I\x92ve always loved it. It feels like my head is \x93exploding with silence\x94 when it happens&#39;,
 &#34;I was looking into this problem with headphones recently and it seemed the info was all over the internet. Like, it was a known issue, with a known cause. Is there something new in what he&#39;s describing that I&#39;m missing?&#34;,
